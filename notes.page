"Some say that a god lives on in the faith and memory of its believers. They point to computers and say, 'Behold, they need but think all together in a particular & precise mode, and from nowhere appear things real and greater than any they thought. Might not the same be true of humans, who are so much greater?' But this is no more true than a painting of a flower the flower itself."

"Do there exist things like evolutionary compilers? Consider that for types like Int or Bool there exist a finite and enumerable number of values, so it is possible (though possibly tiresome) to compare two functions over those enumerated values and ascertain that they are identical in that regard. Could we not use evolutionary computational techniques for one of these two functions to gain considerable efficiency while retaining confidence in the soundness of our program.

This wouldn't work for types like Integer or String (the types we really care about) because they can have indefinitely large sets of members, but we could compare equality over as large subsets as we care to test and then include conditionals: 'if x < 10e10 then quick-Function else full-Precision-Function' and such like. This is kind of like specialization, I believe, but more general and using a general optimization process. There is no free lunch, but only if you already have a ideal algorithm implemented.

This raises a further question: does multi-level evolution work well? That is, could it make sense to evolve fragments of Haskell which type-check and then once one has reached a plateau of quality (presumably corresponding to the discovery of a quick algorithm in which no more gains are to be squeezed out by syntactic modifications, and then take the compiled code and evolve that - seeking micro-optimization gains. I have read a number of studies evolving Lisp fragments, and a number evolving binary streams, but none combining the two in any manner.

As for implementation, it might run something like this: take a copy of the
Prelude as a seed; take a copy of whatever one is working on and concatenate it with the Prelude. Separate out each function into its own 'unit' or file or whatever. On each unit, permute once and compile until it succeeds; once it successfully compiles, run the defined QuickChecks on it. How ever many it passes is its score. Save a copy if the score meets a certain value (like not in the bottom 10%), and continue the permute-compile-test cycle. Once all the QuickChecks are being passed, we can switch over to using SmallCheck and engaging in checks of all possible input up to a certain upper bound. Upon hitting the point of diminishing returns, you could then turn to optimizing the low-level definition... This is rather complicated and I hope there is a framework I can use - it seems to me that someone would've already set up a framework for evolving code and then my task would be much easier as I could focus on the fitness evaluation function."

- paper idea: ''True Visions and Other Dangers: the esoteric and exoteric
tales of Frank Herbert''
      - summary: in Herbert's Dune series, 'forward prescience' is often
detected and discussed in critical analysis. But short shrift has
been given to the subtle indications of 'backwards prescience',
variants of the well-known device of self-fulfilling prophecy, except
in this case, the prophecy causes the events -before- it to happen.
Example: Muad'Dib apparently caused the prescience that led him to
become emperor of the known universe, despite his attempts to avoid
it. And his own prophecies apparently led to his fall. But! His vision
in _Dune Messiah_ should have determined everything, up to and definitely
including the number and gender of his offspring by Chani. But he was
wrong: Leto II was born, and he should not have been. How could he
have been born? His vision was more powerful than Paul's, and he
conquered him in Children of Dune. His overriding vision was the Golden Path, but the Golden Path could not have existed without Leto, and Leto without
Paul's victory. Paul foolishly dabbled in prescience, a power he did
not understand. A BG writing at the end of Dune revealingly says, "To
use power is to make oneself infinitely vulnerable to greater powers."
Paul used power; to whom did he make himself vulnerable?

    > "There was no choice," Paul said. "You understand that, Duncan?"<br>
    > "I understand."<br>
    > "There are some things no one can bear. I meddled in all the possible futures I could create until, finally, they created me." --_Dune Messiah_

        - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anxiety_of_Influence>. every artist makes his predecessors... Borges. RahXephon and Eva... <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RahXephon#Neon_Genesis_Evangelion> (comparison). Eva ineluctably influenced RahXephon... RahXephon's manga begun 2001, Evangelion's TV 1995. mecha anime are remixes... variations. the pleasure of watching one is seeing the variation on the Truth, of trying to see each one get closer and closer to the heart of the matter. "I've taken on a risk: "It's just an imitation". And for now I can only write this explanation. But perhaps our "original" lies somewhere within there." (Hideaki Anno, from his story treatment "What were we trying to make here?" written before NGE began being produced by Gainax, as recorded on page 171 of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion Volume 1'', Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, translated by Fred Burke.

          There is a deep relation here to Japanese poetry, in which originality is not necessarily valued. every change in a mecha anime from its predecessors is a reply, an ongoing dialog back and forth. how do mecha change? where have they gone to? look for the RahXephon bibles.

        - Interesting idea: for God to exist, it must necessarily be limited and vulnerable to change, or be limited an unchanging. Either is unacceptable. If God exists, that is a truly atheistic enterprise.

        > "What do I mean by this, Eva fans? Simply that while there may not be any indication that there is a God behind the world of Evangelion, such a lack is not supposed either. Alternately, it may mean that there is a God, but that such a God, by virtue of existence, is imperfect, and thus not the Absolute so many of us seem to take it to be. And consider Eva's addition of a first half of the underlying Final Lie of the 108. Perhaps the assignment of a concrete God would be the most atheistic project Eva could undertake."

> "That is, from January 1926 through December 2002, when holding periods were 19 years or longer, the cumulative real return on stocks was never negative..."

How does one engage in extremely long investments? On a time-scale of centuries, investment is a difficult task, especially if one seeks to avoid erosion of returns by the costs of active management.

'Unit Investment Trust (UIT) is a US investment company offering a fixed (unmanaged) portfolio of securities having a definite life.'

'A closed-end fund is a collective investment scheme with a limited number of shares'

In long-term investments, one must become concerned about biases in the data used to make decisions. Many of these biases fall under the general rubric of "observer biases" - the canonical example being that stocks look like excellent investments if you only consider America's stock market, where returns over long periods have been quite good. For example, if you had invested by tracking the major indices any time period from January 1926 through December 2002 and had held onto your investment for at least 19 years, you were guaranteed a positive real return. Of course, the specification of place (America) and time period (before the Depression and after the Internet bubble) should alert us that this guarantee may not hold elsewhere. Had a long-term investor in the middle of the 19th century decided to invest in a large up-and-coming country with a booming economy and strong military (much like the United States has been for much of the 20th century), they would have reaped excellent returns. That is, until the hyperinflation of the Wiemar Republic. Should their returns have survived the inflation and imposition of a new currency, then the destruction of the 3rd Reich would surely have rendered their shares and Reichmarks worthless. Similarly for another up-and-coming nation - Japan. Mention of Russia need not even be made.

Clearly, diversifying among companies in a sector, or even sectors in a national economy is not enough. Disaster can strike an entire nation. Rosy returns for stocks quietly ignore those bloody years in which exchanges plunged thousands of percent in real terms, and whose records burned in the flames of war. Over a timespan of a century, it is impossible to know whether such destruction will be visited on a given country or even whether it will still exist as a unit. How could Germany, the preeminent power on the Continent, with a burgeoning navy rivaling Britain's, with the famous Prussian military and Junkers, with an effective industrial economy still famed for the quality of its mechanisms, and with a large homogeneous population of hardy people possibly fall so low as to be utterly conquered? And by the United States and others, for that matter? How could Japan, with its fanatical warriors and equally fanatical populace, its massive fleet and some of the best airplanes in the world - a combination that had humbled Russia, that had occupied Korea for nigh on 40 years, which easily set up puppet governments in Manchuria and China when and where it pleased - how could it have been defeated so wretchedly as to see its population literally decimated and its governance wholly supplanted? How could a god be dethroned?

It is perhaps not too much to say that investors in the United States, who say that the Treasury Bond has never failed to be redeemed and that the United States can never fall, are perhaps overconfident in their assessment. Inflation need not be hyper to cause losses. Greater nations have been destroyed quickly. Who remembers the days when the Dutch fought the English and the French to a standstill and ruled over the shipping lanes? Remember that Nineveh is one with the dust.

In short, our data on returns is biased. This bias indicates that stocks and cash are much more risky than most people think, and that this risk inheres in exogenous shocks to economies - it may seem odd to invest globally, in multiple currencies, just to avoid the rare black swans of total war and hyperinflation. But these risks are catastrophic risks. Even one may be too many.

This risk is more general. Governments can die, and so their bonds and other instruments (such as cash) rendered worthless; how many governments have died or defaulted over the last century? Many. The default assumption must be that the governments with good credit, who are not in that number, may simply have been lucky. And luck runs out.

In general, entities die unpredictably, and one has no guarantee that a, say, 1500 year old Koren construction company will honor its bills in another 500 years because all it takes is one bubble to drive it into bankruptcy. When one looks at securities turning into money, of course all you see are ones for those entities which survived. This is 'survivorship bias'; our observations are biased because we aren't looking at all of the past, but the present. This can be exploited, however. Obviously if an entity perishes, it has no need for assets.

Suppose one wishes to make a very long-term investment. One groups with a large number of other investors who wish to make similar investments, in a closed-end mutual fund with a share per investor, which is set to liquidate at some remote period. This fund would invest in assets all over the world and of various kinds, seeking great diversification. The key ingredient would be that shares are not allowed to be transferred. Should an investor perish, the value of their share would be split up amongst the other investors' shares (a percentage could be used to pay for management, perhaps). Because of this ingredient, the expected return for any individual investor would be extremely high - the potential loss is 100%, but the investor by definition will never be around for that loss. Because the identity and number of investments is fixed, potential control of the assets could be dispersed among the investors so as to avoid the situation where war destroys the headquarters of whomever is managing the assets. The technical details are unimportant; cryptography has many ingenious schemes for such matters (one can easily heavily encrypt a file and then distribute n keys where n - k are needed to decrypt the file).

'Suppose you think that gold will become worthless on April 27th, 2020 at between four and four-thirty in the morning. I, on the other hand, think this event will not occur until 2030. We can sign a contract in which I pay you one ounce of gold per year from 2010 to 2020, and then you pay me two ounces of gold per year from 2020 to 2030. If gold becomes worthless when you say, you will have profited; if gold becomes worthless when I say, I will have profited. We can have a prediction market on a generic apocalypse, in which participants who believe in an earlier apocalypse are paid by believers in a later apocalypse, until they pass the date of their prediction, at which time the flow reverses with interest. I don't see any way to distinguish between apocalypses, but we can ask the participants why they were willing to bet, and probably receive a decent answer.'

    01:04 < gwern> I think one of the more interesting trends in anime is the massive number of adaptations of light novels done in the '90s and 00s; it is interesting because no such trend exists in American media as far as I can tell (the closest I can think of are comic book adaptations, but of course those are analogous to the many mangas -> animes)
    01:04 < gwern> now, American media absolutely adapts many novels, but they are all normal Serious Business Novels
    01:05 < gwern> we do not seem to even have the light novel media - young adult novels do not cut the mustard. light novels are odd as they are kind of like speculative fiction novellas

question for self: if America doesn't have the light novel category, is that a claim that the _Twilight_ novels, and everything published under the James Patterson brand, are regular novels?

answer: The _Twilight_ novels are no more light novels than the _Harry Potter_ novels were. The Patterson novels may fit, however; they have some of the traits such as very short chapters, simple literary style, and very quick moving plots, even though they lack a few less important traits (such as including illustrations). It might be better to say that there is no recognized and successful light novel *genre* rather than individual light novels - there are only unusual examples like the Patterson novels and other works uncomfortable listed under the Young Adult/Teenager rubric.

In _[Human Achievement](!Wikipedia)_, one of the strongest indicators for genius is contact with a foreign culture. However, the modern era which is likely the most globalized one, in which English-speakers have access like they have never had before (compare how much classic Japanese & Chinese literature has been translated and stored in libraries as of 2009 to what was available when Waley began translating _Genji Monogatari_ in 1921!). This would seem to be something of a contradiction: if a little foreign contact was enough to inspire the 'chinoiserie' of France's Rococo period, then why wouldn't all the Asian immigrants and translations and economic contact to America spark even greater revolutions? There has been influence, absolutely; but the influence is striking for how a little bit helped (how many haiku did the Imagists have access to?) and a lot done not much more, and perhaps even less.
This is a little perplexing. What's the explanation? Did the early artists suck out all the novelty? Or is there something stimulating about having only a few examples - does one draw faulty but fruitful inferences based on idiosyncrasies of the small data set?

<https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ego_depletion>
'Ego depletion refers to the idea that self-control and other mental processes that require focused conscious effort rely on energy that can be used up. When that energy is low (rather than high), mental activity that requires self-control is impaired. In other words, using one's self-control impairs the ability to control one's self later on. In this sense, the idea of (limited) willpower is correct.'

"Latent inhibition is a process by which exposure to a stimulus of little or no consequence prevents conditioned associations with that stimulus being formed. The ability to disregard or even inhibit formation of memory, by preventing associative learning of observed stimuli, is an automatic response and is thought to prevent information overload. Latent inhibition is observed in many species, and is believed to be an integral part of the observation/learning process, to allow the self to interact successfully in a social environment."
"Most people are able to shut out the constant stream of incoming stimuli, but those with low latent inhibition cannot. It is hypothesized that a low level of latent inhibition can cause either psychosis, a high level of creativity[1] or both, which is usually dependent on the subject's intelligence.[2][3] Those of above average intelligence are thought to be capable of processing this stream effectively, an ability that greatly aids their creativity and ability to recall trivial events in incredible detail and which categorizes them as almost creative geniuses. Those with less than average intelligence, on the other hand, are less able to cope, and so as a result are more likely to suffer from mental illness."

Professor Grim tells a story about an acquaintance of his, who had once accepted a job at Yale's psychology department. He was driving into New Haven on his way to it, when he stopped for gas. The fellow working the station began filling up his car and they fell to chatting. (This was long ago.) When he mentioned that he was going to his new job there, the attendant stiffened up, removing the gas pump, and retreated into the far side of the garage. Incensed, he followed the attendant and demanded an answer. The attendant eventually stopped the cold shoulder and quietly said that once he had participated in Milgram's infamous authoritarian experiments, and was one of those who had gone through with it all. "And", he added, "I have not slept well since."

What's the killer app for non-medical genetic engineering in humans?

How about germ-line engineering of hair color? think about it. hair color is controlled by relatively few, and well-understood, genes. hair color is a dramatic change. there is massive demand for hair dye as it is, even with the extra effort and impermanence and unsatisfactory results. how many platinum blonds would jump at the chance to have kids who are *truly* enviably blond? or richly red-headed (and not washed-out Irish read)? A heck of a lot, I'd say. The health risks need not be enormous - aside from the intervention itself, what risk could swapping a brunette gene for blond cause? (There apparently is just 1 relevant gene: "Frost's theory is also backed up by a separate scientific analysis of north European genes carried out at three Japanese universities, which has isolated the date of the genetic mutation that resulted in blond hair to about 11,000 years ago." <http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article735078.ece>)

What sort of market could we expect? <https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States>
103,129,321 women between 15 and 64; these are women who could be using dye themselves, so appreciate the benefit, and are of child-bearing years.
Likely, the treatment will only work if there's natural variation to begin with - that is, for Caucasians only. We'll probably want to exclude Hispanics and Latin Americans, who are almost as homogeneous in hair color as blacks and Asians, so that leaves us 66% of the total US population. 66% * 103,129,321 will get us a rough estimate of 6.806535186e7 or 68,065,351.

<http://www.isteve.com/blondes.htm> claims that "One study estimated that of the 30% of North American women who are blonde, 5/6^ths^ had some help from a bottle." (0.3 * (5/6) = 0.25 or 25%) en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_North_America says
<https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Demographics_of_Mexico> says 53,013,433 females
<https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Canada_2006_Census#Age_and_sex> 16,136,925

or 172,279,679 when you sum up Mexico/Canada/USA (the remaining NA states are too small to care about); 25% of 172,279,679 is 43,069,919. 43 million dye users.

Here's a random report <http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp?report_id=305358> saying hair dye is worth 1 billion USD a year. Let's assume that this is all consumed domestically by women. (So 1,000,000,000 / 43,069,919 per year is 23)

A woman using hair dye on a permanent basis will be dying every month or so, or 12 times a year. Assume that one dye job is ~20 USD* (she's not doing it herself); then ((1b / 20) / 12) gives us ~4,166,666 women using hair dye, or 1/24 or 4.1% of eligible women. This seems rather low to me, based on observations, but I suppose it may be that elderly women do not use much hair dye, or the trend to using highlights and less-than-complete dye jobs. But 4% seems like a rather safe lower end. That's a pretty large market - 4 million potential customers, who are regularly expressing their financial commitment to their desire to have some hair color other than their natural one.

If each is spending even 100$ a year on it, a genetic engineering treatment could pay for itself very quickly. At 1000$, just 10 years. (And women can expect to live ~80). Not to mention, one would expect the natural hair to simply look better than the dye job.

There's a further advantage to this: it seems reasonable to expect that early forms of this sort of therapy will simply not work for minorities such as blacks or Hispanics - their markets wouldn't justify the research to make it work for them; their dark hair colors seem to be very dominant genetically, and likely the therapy would be working with recessive alleles (at least, it seems intuitively plausible that there is less 'distance' between making a Caucasian embryo, who might even have a recessive blonde allele already, fully blond, as compared to making a black baby, who would never ever come anywhere near a non-black hair color, blond). So marketing would benefit from an implicit racism and classism: racism in that one might need to be substantially Caucasian to benefit, and classism to be able to pony up the money up front.

* I think this price is a low-ball estimate by at least 50%; hopefully it will give us a margin of error, since I'm not sure how often dye-jobs need to be done.

Conspiracy theory: just as _Melancholy_ is about how Kyon is god and not Haruhi, so the true story behind _Aria_ has to do with the cats. Even the Wikipedia article mentions that they are nearly as intelligent as humans (explaining some of their grossly outsized heads). Yet they do nothing. But we know they live for centuries as evidenced by how the cat-president of Aria Company doesn't visibly age even as the founder of Aria goes from a young girl to a wizened granny, while humans in _Aria_ seem to live not much longer than we do (the old people on Neo Venezia don't seem to date back to the terraforming of Mars/Aqua, which was only a century or 3 ago). Further, there is the mysterious character of Caith Sith (!) who is enormous, easily as large as 3 or 4 humans, and who commands all the cats; he too dates back centuries - he annually visits Neo Venezia costumed as Casanova, and those visits have been going on as long as anyone knows. Why does each gondolier agency have a cat as president? Perhaps this reflects the hidden truth of their control; perhaps it gives them license to be constantly wandering the city spying on people and visitors. Perhaps they are the smallest of the cats, suitable unobtrusive and invisible - Cait Sith's intelligence agents!

Or consider Natural episodes 20 (?) and 21, where Cait Sith is revealed to have power over evil ghosts, and to be the conductor of a Galaxy Railway. Confusingly, the evil ghost he dispels from Akari is presented as an ancient legend from Earth about an executed criminal (needless to say, no one has ever been executed on Aqua, although we hear of deaths in accidents) - although at the end of the episode we learn the legend and ghost post-date Aqua and Neo-Venezia's founding! How can all this be reconciled?

Let's pull back and look at Aqua. Every single craft and industry on Aqua seems aimed at either basic needs (the many windmills supply basic electricity needs), or aimed at tourists (the entire undine system, all the little coffee shops, the island of glassblowers, etc.). The system is otherwise absurd - why are highly educated expensive humans spending their lives rowing people around on errands over distances of a few hundred meters? Even vehicles slowed down to the point that they didn't damage Neo-Venezia would be economically superior, to say nothing of all the laborious handicrafts and obsolete professions practiced. Seriously, they have a bustling *postal office*? Keep in mind, _Aria_ is set in the distant future, many centuries or maybe even millennia from now, at a time where Earth-Mars travel is routine and humanity has the power to terraform entire *worlds* and generate gravity/anti-gravity and who knows what other miracles? And yet, here's an entire city of 100% normal humans (here's how old fashioned they are: I can't think of a single homosexual pairing) going about their business, with the only inkling of the far future being the occasional preternaturally intelligent cat, supernatural occurrence, and floating ship/island? *LAME*.

Or, is it? Everyone in Neo-Venezia seems disgustingly happy, and even when they're sad they do it in a fun quaint way. They all seem far more satisfied in their careers than we are, and certainly their food and art seem better. Their architecture may be ancient, but gosh darn it all, doesn't Aria Company's house look *clean* and *livable*?

> "Simplicity of life, even the barest, is not a misery, but the very foundation of refinement: a sanded floor and whitewashed walls, and the green trees, and flowery meads, and living waters outside; or a grimy palace amid the smoke with a regiment of housemaids always working to smear the dirt together so that it may be unnoticed; which, think you, is the most refined, the most fit for a gentleman of those 2 dwellings?" --William Morris

That's not something I can really say of most American housing.

What Neo-Venezia is truly, I think, is a picture of _la dolce vita_ - the sweet life, the pleasant one. The inhabitants of Neo-Venezia don't strive for major accomplishments: they compete to become Primas or for promotions as salamanders/gnomes only so far as lends their lives a little spice.

The inhabitants are, in fact, closely akin to _The Time Machine_'s 'eloi'. They don't work hard at all, are never shown in the countless technical roles that an interplanetary civilization ought to require, and are astoundingly ignorant. One romantic episode covers how one character is so ignorant of basic physics that *gravity* has to be explained to her. Even in our age it's hard to be ignorant of gravity unless one is astoundingly ill-educated or stupid, and the character would seem to be neither. Her ignorance is likely quite general. (How do
the gravity-generating 'stones' work? Even the character whose career is maintaining them doesn't seem to really know. They're just there.)

Of course, there are no Morlocks in _Aria_ to put our beloved characters in danger. They just float along happily through life.

Interesting enough a view, but what does it have to do with Cait Sith? Well, if Neo-Venezia is a post-post-post...-modern paradise, then isn't there something missing - a sense of mystery, of grandeur? Mystery and a lack of control is one of the fundamental things separating an authentic experience apart from a controlled *corporate* one. If that mysterious garden in a former monastery known only to a select few were actually Mysterious Location #44, visited every week by Neo-Venezia Corp.'s gardeners - it would instantly lose most of its charm.

Caith Sith and his cat followers supply that mystery. Where does that train go? How does that cafe appear only to Akari and to everyone else as a derelict? What do the cats discuss at their conclaves? Why does Cait Sith annually perform as Casanova during Carnivale? This mysteries concern not just Akari, but everyone - the rumors spread, and people on the periphery are affected. Perhaps Caith Sith _et al_'s only role is to create this mystery, perhaps they are charged with this mission by the 'heart of Aqua' that Alicia speaks so vaguely of. The ghost may be manufactured, and Sith to save anyone who is taken by her (how could the rumor spread if she only approaches solitary undines, and kills each one? What living witnesses?)

The true civilization would remain unknown. Perhaps it is run by AIs - perhaps this is what the Singularity looks like on the other side. There are worse utopias, after all, than ones that give us a bohemian European lifestyle.

Humans kept as very happy pets? (The cats then would be a supreme irony on the part of the AIs.) It's more likely than you think.

Repugnant Hansonian idea:

We know that child abuse is strongly correlated with a wider standard deviation in adult accomplishment (TODO: what's the long-term longitudinal study about this? Not the Harvard one?) (it can destroy the kids, but also spur them on to great achievements). This is a little odd, since one might expect child abuse to be purely destructive and not grant intrinsic motivation. But since great achievements are so much more valuable than mediocrity (one genius can 'make up for' thousands or even millions of gutless wonders), this suggests that if we just care about utility, and we can't shift the whole bell curve over to the right hand side (to greater achievement), then we want to widen the standard deviation as much as possible. Given that child abuse is one such widening, then this suggests that we as a society taking the long view do not want to interfere with child abuse. Another consideration is Nick Bostrom's 'status quo bias', which suggests that the current status quo may be incorrect; if something in the air caused a 1% increase in child abuse and this gave us, say, 10 extra Nobel Prizes' worth of work a year, (TODO: is this plausible based on the motivation research? Crunch the numbers), and we would permit this, then we ought to be willing to cause such a 1% increase as well as permit it.

Why does the camel have 2 humps? <http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf> "All teachers of programming find that their results display a 'double hump'. It is as if there are two populations: those who can, and those who cannot, each with its own independent bell curve." tho Alan Kay seems a little skeptical <http://www.secretgeek.net/camel_kay.asp>
There's something to this; your first computer language is really hard no matter your experience
but the second is almost trivial, unless it's a truly alien paradigm
TODO: is it easier to learn a second natural language, or a second computer language? haskell after some java was a lot easier than before; learning french after learning haskell, it seems easier than before but not that much
what is the knack of programming? Why do people never seem to cease being programmers - what irreversible paradigm shift happens in their heads?

> "Tellman initialized the Celest board to level nine, Rosas noticed. The kid studied the setup with a calculating look. Tellman's display was a flat, owing a hypothetical solar system as seen from above the plane of rotation. The three planets were small disks of light moving around the primary. Their size gave a clue to mass, but the precise values appeared near the bottom of the display. Departure and arrival planets moved in visibly eccentric orbits, the departure planet at one rev every five seconds — fast enough so precession was clearly occurring. Between it and the destination planet moved a third world, also in eccentric orbit. Rosas grimaced. No doubt the only reason Tellman left the problem coplanar was that he didn't have a holo display for his Celest. Mike had never seen anyone without a symbiotic processor play the departure/destination version of Celest at level nine. The timer on the display showed that the player — the kid — had ten seconds to launch his rocket and try to make it to the destination. From the fuel display, Rosas was certain that there was not enough energy available to make the flight in a direct orbit. A cushion shot on top everything else!

> The kid laid all his bank notes on the table and squinted at the screen. Six seconds left. He grasped the control handles and twitched them. The tiny golden spark that represented his spacecraft fell away from the green disk of the departure world, inward toward the yellow sun about which all revolved. He had used more than nine-tenths of his fuel and had boosted in the wrong direction. The children around him murmured their displeasure, and a smirk came over Tellman's face. The smirk froze:

> As the spacecraft came near the sun, the kid gave the controls another twitch, a boost which — together with the gravity of the primary-sent the glowing dot far out into the mock solar system. It edged across the two-meter screen, slowing the greater remove, heading not for the destination planet but for the intermediary. Rosas gave an low, involuntary whistle. He had played Celest, both alone and with a processor. The game was nearly a century old and almost as popular as chess; it made you remember what the human race had almost attained. Yet he had never seen such a two-cushion shot by an unaided player.

> Tellman's smile remained but his face was turning a bit gray. The vehicle drew close to the middle planet, catching up to it as it swung slowly about the primary. The kid made barely perceptible adjustments in the trajectory during the closing period. Fuel status on the display showed 0.001 full. The representation of the planet and the spacecraft merged for an instant, but did not record as a collision, for the tiny dot moved quickly away, going for the far reaches of the screen.

> Around them, the other children jostled and hooted. They smelled a winner, and old Tellman was going to lose a little of the money he had been winning off them earlier in the day. Rosas and Naismith and Tellman just watched and held their breaths. With virtually no fuel left, it would be a matter of luck whether contact finally occurred.

> The reddish disk of the destination planet swam placidly along while the mock spacecraft arced higher and higher, slower and slower, their paths becoming almost tangent. The craft was accelerating now, falling into the gravity well the destination, giving the tantalizing impression of success that always comes with a close shot. Closer and closer. And the two lights became one on the board.

> "Intercept," the display announced, and the stats streamed across the lower part of the screen. Rosas and Naismith looked at each other. The kid had done it"

--Vernor Vinge, _The Peace War_

Visual presentation: basic problem, how to represent 4D trajectories, since players simply can't be given all the necessary information, must be computed. The trajectories are orbital paths. Plot paths as visible lines, with *color*: time is represented as shades of color, from red->purple. Each time unit is one pixel change, for example. 2 lines/paths intersect/collide only if they have the same color when crossing. Perhaps color intersections black or white to denote collision or miss? (And grey to indicate near-miss? Or closeness of approach?)

So recently (October 2009) there appeared online a PDF file claiming to be a script for the Hollywood remake of the _[Death Note](!Wikipedia)_ anime (see Wikipedia, or my own little [Death Note Ending]() essay, for a description). Such a leak begs the question, is it genuine?

I was skeptical at first - how many unproduced screenplays get leaked? it's rare even in this Internet age - so I downloaded a copy and read it.

The first thing I noticed was that the 2 claimed authors, "Charley and Vlas Parlapanides, were correct: they were the 2 brothers of whom it had been quietly [announced](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003063.html) in April 2009 that they were hired to write it.

The second thing I did was take a look at the metadata. The creator tool checks out: "DynamicPDF v5.0.2 for .NET" is part of a commercial suite, and it was pirated well before July 2009, although I could not figure out when the commercial release was.

The date, though, is "Thu 09 Apr 2009 09:32:47 PM EDT". Keep in mind, this leak was October, and the original announcement was 30 April or so. If one were faking such a script, wouldn't one through either sheer carelessness & omission or by natural assumption (the Parlapanides signed a contract, the press release went out, and they started work) set the date well after the announcement? Why would you set it close to a month before? Wouldn't you take pains to show everything is exactly as an outsider would expect it to be? As Borges writes in "The Argentine Writer and Tradition":

> "Gibbon observes [in the _[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire](!Wikipedia)_] that in the Arab book _par excellence_, the Koran, there are no camels; I believe that if there were ever any doubt as to the authenticity of the Koran, this lack of camels would suffice to prove it Arab. It was written by Mohammed, and Mohammed as an Arab had no reason to know that camels were particularly Arab; they were for him a part of reality, and he had no reason to single them out, while the first thing a forger or tourist or Arab nationalist would do is to bring on the camels - whole caravans of camels on every page; but Mohammed, as an Arab, was unconcerned. He knew he could be Arab without camels."

Another small point is the 'EDT', or Eastern Daylight-savings Time. The Parlapanides have long been based out of New Jersey

Then there is the corporate address quietly listed at the bottom of the page. It is widely available on Google if you can search for it, but one has to know about it in the first place. Easier to just leave it out. Another interesting detail.

What of the actual play? Well, it is written like a screenplay, properly formatted, and the scene descriptions are brief but occasionally detailed like the other screenplays I've read (such as the ''Star Wars'' trilogy's scripts). It is quite long and detailed. I could easily see a 2 hour movie being filmed from it. There are no obvious red flags.

The plot is curious. Ryuk and other [shinigami](!Wikipedia) are entirely omitted. Light is renamed 'Luke', and now lives in New York City, already in college. (Again, an appropriate setting for 2 screenwriters who grew up in New Jersey.) The plot is generally simplified.

What is more interesting is the changed emphases. Luke has been given a murdered mother, and much of his efforts go to tracking down the murderer (who, of course, escaped conviction for that murder). The Death Note is unambiguously depicted as a tool for evil, and a malign influence in its own right. There is minimal interest in the idea that Kira might be good. The Japanese aspects are minimized and treated as exotic curios, in the worst Hollywood tradition (Luke goes to a Japanese acquaintance for a translation of the kanji for 'shinigami', who, of course, being a primitive native, shudders in fear and flees the memsahib... oh, sorry, wrong era. But the description is still accurate.)

The ending shows Luke using the memory-wiping gambit to elude L (who from the script seems much the same, although things not covered by the script, such as casting, will be critically important to making L, L), and finding the hidden message from his old self - but destroying the message before he learns where he had hidden the Death Note. It is implied that Luke has redeemed himself, and L is letting him go. So the ending is classic Hollywood pap.

The ending indicates someone who doesn't love DN for its shades of gray mentality, its constant ambiguity and complexity. Any DN fan feels deep sympathy for Light, even if they root for L and co. I suspect that if they were to pen a script, the ending would be of the 'Light wins everything' variety, and not this hackneyed sop. I know I couldn't bring myself to write such a thing, even as a parody of Hollywood.

In general, the dialogue is short and hackneyed. There are no excellent megalomaniac speeches about creating a new world; one can expect a dearth of ominous choral chanting in the movie. Even the veriest tyro of fanfiction could write more DN-like dialogue than this script did.

Further, the complexities of ratiocination are largely absent, remaining only in the TV trick of L and the famous chips scene by Light. The tricks are even written incompetently - as written, on the bus, the crucial ID is seen by accident, whereas in DN, Light had written in the ID quite specifically. The moral subtlety of DN is gone; you cannot argue that Luke is a new god like Light. He is only an angry boy with a good heart lashing out, but by the end he has returned to the straight and narrow of conventional morality.

So much for the inside evidence; all suggestive, none damning. A forger *could* have randomly changed Charles to Charlie, looked up an appropriate address, edited the metadata, come up with all the Hollywood touches, wrote the whole damn thing (quite an endeavour since relatively little material is borrowed from DN), and put it online.

But is there any external evidence? Well, the timeline is right. Figure about 2 months for both brothers to read through the DN manga or watch the anime twice, clear up their other commitments, a month to brainstorm, 3 months to write the first draft, a month to edit it up and run it by the studio, and we're at 7 months or around February 2009. That leave a good 6 months for it to float around offices and get leaked, and then come to the wider attention of the Internet.

And then there is the fact that Warner Brothers has filed multiple take-down notices for hosts of the script. Not the 2 brothers, who would have a legal right to order the take-down of material falsely attributed to them, but the commissioning studio. Needless to say, they do not have a standing RIAA-style war against DN fanfiction or fan-art or even torrents of the anime or scanlations of the manga; just this script. Arguably, if the script were not the studio's property, it wouldn't have any legal ground to demand take-downs - their license likely covers just the movie rights, and so fanfiction in the form of a script (for example) would infringe on the Japanese rights-holder, not the studio.

I find this external legal argument fairly compelling, and in conjunction with the internal evidence and oddities best explained by the leaked script being authentically by the Hollywood scriptwriters, I've come to believe the script real. Perhaps an early draft, but still genuine. I suppose an American DN movie could be much much worse; just consider _[Dragon Ball Evolution](!Wikipedia)_!

Theory: as time passes, it becomes more and more costly to have a 'common' name: a name which frequently appears either in history or in born-digital works. In the past, having a name like 'John Smith' may have not been a disadvantage - connections were personal, no one confused one John Smith with another, textual records were only occasionally used. It might sometimes be an issue with bureaucracy such as taxes or the legal system, but nowhere else.

But online, it is important to be findable. You want your friends on Facebook to find you with the first hit. You want potential employers doing surreptitious Google searches before an interview to see your accomplishments and not others' demerits.

This isn't obvious. It's easy to raise relatively rare risks as objections (but how many cases of identity theft are made possible solely by a relatively unique name making a person google-able? Surely few compared to the techniques of mass identity theft: corporate espionage, dumpster diving, cracking, skimming etc.) To appreciate the advantages, you have to be a 'digital native'. Until you've tried to Google friends or acquaintances, the hypothesis that unique names might be important will never occur to you. Until then, as long as your name was unique inside your school classes, or your neighborhood, or your section of the company, you would never notice. Even researchers spend their time researching unimportant correlations like people named Baker becoming bakers more often, or people tending to move to a state whose name they share (like Georgia).
What does one do? One avoids as much as possible choosing any name which is in the say, top 100 most popular names. People with especially rare surnames may be able to get away with common personal names, but not the Smiths.
But one doesn't wake up and say I will name myself Zachariah today because John is so damn common. After 20 years or more, one is heavily invested in one's name. It's acceptable to change one's surname (women do it all the time), but not the first name.

One *does* decide the first name of one's children, though, and it's iron tradition that one does so. So we can expect digital natives to shy away from common names when naming their kids. But remember who are the 'digital natives' - kids and teenagers of the '00s, at the very earliest. If they haven't been on, say, Facebook for years, they don't count. Let's say their ages are 0-20 during 2008 when Facebook really picked up steam in the non-college population; and let's say that they won't have kids until ~30. The oldest of this cohort will reach child-bearing age at around 2018, and every one after that can be considered a digital native from osmosis if nothing else. 2018 is when we will see a growing '[long tail](!Wikipedia "Heavy-tailed distribution")' of baby names.

So this is a good story: we have a suboptimal situation (too many collisions in the new global namespace of the Internet) and a predicted adjustment with specific empirical consequences.
But there are issues.

- Given names follow a power-law distribution already where a few names dominate, and so small artifacts can make it appear that there is a shift towards unpopular names. Immigration or ethnic groups can distort the statistics and make us think we see a decline in popular names when we're actually seeing an increase in popular names elsewhere - imagine all the Muhammeds and Jesuses we might see in the future. Those will show up as decreases in the percentages of 'John' or 'James' or 'Emily' or 'William', and fool us, even though Muhammed and Jesus are 2 of the most popular names in the world.
- There's already a decline in popular names, according to [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Given names#Popularity distribution of given names"):

    > "Since about 1800 in England and Wales and in the U.S., the popularity distribution of given names has been shifting so that the most popular names are losing popularity. For example, in England and Wales, the most popular female and male names given to babies born in 1800 were Mary and John, with 24% of female babies and 22% of male babies receiving those names, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding statistics for in England and Wales in 1994 were Emily and James, with 3% and 4% of names, respectively. Not only have Mary and John gone out of favor in the English speaking world, also the overall distribution of names has changed significantly over the last 100 years for females, but not for males."

    The theory could probably be rescued by saying that the advantage of having a unique given name (and thus a relatively unique full name) goes that far back, but then we would need to explain why the advantage would be there for women, but *not* men.
- Pop culture is known to have a very strong influence on baby names (cf. the popularity of _Star Wars_ and the subsequent massive spike in 'Luke'). The counter-arguments to [The Long Tail](!Wikipedia) marketing theory say that pop culture is becoming ever more monolithic and hit-driven. The fewer hits, and the more mega-hits, the more we could expect a few names to spike and drive down the rate of other names. The effect on a rare name can be incredible even from relatively small hits (the song in question was only a Top 10):

    > "Kayleigh became a particularly popular name in the United Kingdom following the release of a song by the British rock group Marillion. Government statistics in 2005 revealed that 96% of Kayleighs were born after 1985, the year in which Marillion released "Kayleigh"."^[Wikipedia again]

(The above appears to be pretty common knowledge among people interested in baby names and onomastics in general; for example, a _Washington Post_ editorial by Laura Wattenberg, "Are our unique baby names that unique?", 16 Sunday May 2010, argues much of the above.)

Here's an interesting idea: the glyphs of the Phoenician-style alphabet are not optimized in any sense. They are bad in several ways, and modern glyphs are little better. For example, v and w, or m and n. People confuse them all the time, both in reading and in writing.

So that's one criterion: glyphs should be as distinct from all the rest as possible.

What's a related criterion? m and w are another pair which seem suboptimal, yet they are as dissimilar as, say, a and b, under many reasonable metrics. m and w are related via *symmetry*. Even though they share relatively few pixels, they are still identical under rotation, and we can see that. We could confuse them if we were reading upside down, or at an angle, or just confuse them period.

So that's our next criterion: the distinctness must also hold when the glyph is rotated by any degree and then compared to the rest.

OK, so we now have a set of unique and dissimilar glyphs that are unambiguous about their orientation. What else? Well, we might want them to be easy to write as well as read. How do we define 'easy to write'? We could have a complicated physiological model about what strokes can easily follow what movements and so on, but we will cop out and say: it is made of as few straight lines and curves as possible. Rather than unwritable pixels in a grid, our primitives will be little geometric primitives.

The fewer the primitives and the closer to integers or common fractions the positioning of said primitives, the simpler and the better.

We throw all these rules in, add a random starting population or better yet a population modeled after the existing alphabet, and begin our genetic algorithm. What 26 glyphs will we get?

Problem: our current glyphs may be optimal in a deep sense:

> Dehaene describes some fascinating and convincing evidence for the first kind of innateness. In one of the most interesting chapters, he argues that the shapes we use to make written letters mirror the shapes that primates use to recognize objects. After all, I could use any arbitrary squiggle to encode the sound at the start of “Tree” instead of a T. But actually the shapes of written symbols are strikingly similar across many languages.
> It turns out that T shapes are important to monkeys, too. When a monkey sees a T shape in the world, it is very likely to indicate the edge of an object — something the monkey can grab and maybe even eat. A particular area of its brain pays special attention to those significant shapes. Human brains use the same area to process letters. Dehaene makes a compelling case that these brain areas have been “recycled” for reading. “We did not invent most of our letter shapes,” he writes. “They lay dormant in our brains for millions of years, and were merely rediscovered when our species invented writing and the alphabet.”

A small gem of equivocation:

An old and somewhat estranged family friend abandoned 2 cats with us when she went to seek her fortune in the West (turned out her brother there was only offering her room because he hoped to get her kidney); the cats lived relatively happily with us until one day, the black one made the mistake of taking a nap behind a wheel. Backing up, my mother ran it over. Yowling, he ran into the garage where we had kept them early on, and in a corner, expired of its injuries.

6 weeks later, the friend called and asked for news of that cat. My mother had previously consulted with her sister and replied - very carefully - 'We found it dead in the garage.'

---

When I was in elementary school, another family friend was named Patti, with sons Nick & Joe (the husband was not apparent). They were perhaps middle school aged, but we got along well, I thought. They had an interesting house. It was by the fire station, roughly in the same part of town (Centereach) as my old blue house. That propinquity and Patti's Dutch heritage explain the original connection, I think. Their (rented) house had a large piece of land, and a U-shaped driveway that went through the front. In the middle was a veritable island-mountain, with a giant pine in the middle. Underneath it was a mass of boulders poking through the thick drifts of needles. I had a Swiss army knife, and delighted in scraping sparks against the stone.

Behind the small red house was an orchard in advanced desuetude. I only ever noticed grapes in its arbors. They were purple, I think, and utterly untended. They were bitter - very foxy. The previous owner had loved grapes.

Joe was older. He liked video games, I remember. At this time in the '90s, there was only Nintendo & Sega with oddball also-rans like Lynx or Neo-Geo that kids like us scoffed at. The distinction was that Sega was known for its capable hardware and more adult games, but a smaller overall game library, and Nintendo was known for its odd controllers, its 1st-party games, and a large library of games (I understand that the SNES game library would only be surpassed only in the 2000s by the PS2 with its backwards compatibility). Joe was a Sega fan, and a diehard one - he demonstrated to me that he had bought the ill-starred 'Mega-CD' and also the poor Sega Saturn, though he had little to play on them but a _Sonic the Hedgehog_ game.

One year, we took Nick & Joe with us down south to visit our grandparents & Washington D.C. with our customary visits to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and the Air & Space Museum. We stayed at the Birch townhouse in Richmond, Virginia. This was a neighborhood of townhouses, with a genteel air and many pines behind the rows of nigh-identical townhouses. There was a little park not far from us. It wasn't used much (there were few enough children in the area) and one day Joe and I had gone there - kicked out from the TV and the flat, I recall, by an adult - and were skirmishing & discussing taekwondo in the silly boastful way kids will who watched too much _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_. Joe claimed to know a great deal about the martial arts, but he said he could not teach me; I and Allison were but green belts and not ready. But, he said, in a few years when I had become a brown (or, hazy memory avers, red) belt, then he would teach me.

A few years later, I had persevered (Allison had stopped) and reached the agreed-upon rank. But by then Patti had ceased to be a good family friend and the last I heard of Joe was in some military.

The famous [Tueller drill](!Wikipedia) reports that a knife man can cover 21 feet & stab in just 1.5 seconds - faster than most trained people can draw and shoot a gun.

There is a lesson here. I take away this message: most people don't really care. The existentialists tell us we have tremendous power & freedom but we don't use it and we forget it. I agree that we have tremendous destructive powers, but this also implies that we have limited constructive powers. (Destructive powers don't interfere with each other, but they mean that it is far harder to create than to destroy. Anyone can destroy a DVD with ease, but to manufacture it, much less create whatever it stored, is much harder - a task fit for an entire country or civilization.)

Destruction can be useful though. Many people all over the political spectrum has expressed earnest desires in the last few years to destroy some group or institution. Terrorists come to mind.

But the odd thing is, very little destruction has happened. A nut with a gun has an average kill or destruction rate better than that of your average terrorist. A little effective planning, and a nut could do a *lot*. [Marvin Heemeyer](!Wikipedia) is a case in point. Despite unrelenting police opposition, he and his armored bulldozer destroyed 13 buildings worth $7 million. He was stopped by his own incompetence when he drove the bulldozer into a basement; he then committed suicide. (The police were requesting an airstrike from an Apache, but who knows how long that would have taken?)

I also point out a far more effective terrorist strategy than existing ones in my essays on terrorism.

A good answer for terrorists specifically is the social one; but what about everyone else? Why do they not pursue their targets with all the highly effective means possible?

> "If we were bees, ants, or Lacedaemonian warriors, to whom personal fear does not exist and cowardice is the most shameful thing in the world, warring would go on forever.
> But luckily we are only men - and cowards."
--Erwin Schrodinger, _Mind and Matter_

The answer is motivation and values. We value ordinary comforts & life. The power is available to us only at the cost of everything else. Fruitful comparison might be made with idiot savants or autistics with obsessive interests, or less pathologically, subgroups like 'otaku' or '[anoraks](!Wikipedia "Anorak (slang)")'.

Fictional examples are also of interest. Larry Niven offers us the [Pak Protector](!Wikipedia) - a genius variety of human who are obsessed with protecting their kindred. Though described as super-intelligences, Niven, being an ordinary human himself, depicts Pak feats within reach of a motivated human. Vernor Vinge postulates 'Focus' in his _A Deepness In The Sky_: a [hyperfocus](!Wikipedia) or permanent state of being ['in the zone'](!Wikipedia "Flow (psychology)") - with the monomania that implies. (It is worth noting that studies of human genius frequently say that raw IQ and talent are not helpful past unexceptional levels like 130 IQ; what makes the difference is motivation and the 'drive to mastery'.)

Fanatics are frightening. Suicide tactics in even small quantities can be highly effective. The Jewish _sicarri_, or kamikaze are cases in point. Though small in number, they *were* more effective than conventional methods. (Kamikazes were neutralized by the end of WWII, but only by vast opposition - hundreds of defending planes, pickets stationed more than 50 miles away, improved artillery, etc.) That terrorists do so little enhances this point: one 9/11 was so effective that for a million dollars or two at most, it triggered the expenditure (and waste) of thousands of lives and literally trillions of dollars. 1 or 2 million dollars wouldn't even buy a dictator a worthless tank which the USAF could bomb.

Suppose people angry at Goldman Sachs were *truly* angry: so angry that they went beyond posturing and beyond acting against Goldman Sachs only if action were guaranteed to cost them nothing (like writing a blog post). If they ceased to care about whether legal proceedings might be filed against them; if they become obsessed with destroying Goldman Sachs, if they devoted their lives to it and could ignore all bodily urges and creature comforts. If they could be, in a word, like Niven's Protectors or Vinge's Focused.

Could they do it? Could they destroy a 3 century old corporation with close to $1 trillion in assets, with sympathizers and former employees throughout the upper echelons of the United States Federal Government (itself the single most powerful entity in the world)?

Absolutely. It would be easy.

As I said, the destructive power of a human is great.

Let's assume we have 100 such fanatics. (This is a vanishingly small fraction of those who have hated on GS over the years.)

A worrisome example is [Cantor Fitzgerald](!Wikipedia), which lost an entire office and 2/3 of its headcount on 9/11, but is still around. But losing an entire office meant that the hierarchy is largely preserved: one subtree was lopped off, and the main tree continued. Every survivor knew where they were in the hierarchy.

Goldman Sachs has ~30,000 employees. If GS's hierarchy is similar to that of a binary tree, then to knock out the *8* top levels, one only needs to eliminate 256 nodes. The top 6 levels would require only 64 nodes.

If one knocked out the top 6 levels, then each of the remaining subtrees in level 7 has no priority over the rest. And there will be $2^7 - 2^6$ or 64 such subtrees/nodes. It is safe to say that 64 sub-corporations, each potentially headed by someone who wants the entire thing for itself, would have trouble agreeing on how to reconstruct the hierarchy. The stockholders might be expected to step in at this point, but the Board of Directors would be included in the top of the hierarchy, and by definition, they represent the majority of stockholders.

One could launch the attack during a board meeting or similar gathering, and hope to have 1 fanatic take out 10 or 20 targets. But let's be pessimistic and assume each fanatic can only account for 1 target - even if they spend months and years reconnoitering and preparing fanatically.

This leaves us 36 fanatics.

GS will be at a minimum impaired during the attack; financial companies almost uniquely operate on such tight schedules that one day's disruption can open the door to predation. We'll assign 1 fanatic the task of researching emails and telephone numbers and addresses of GS rivals; after a few years of constant schmoozing and FOIA requests and dumpster-diving, he ought to be able to reach major traders at said rivals. When the hammer goes down, he'll fire off notifications and suggestions to his contacts. (For bonus points, he will do so untraceably, and then go off on an additional suicide mission.)

GS claims to have offices in all major financial hubs. Offhand, I would expect that to be no more than 10 or 20 offices. We assign 20 of our remaining 35 fanatics the tasks of building Oklahoma City-sized truck bombs. (This will take a while because modern fertilizer is contaminated specifically to prevent this; our fanatics will have to research how to undo the contamination or acquire alternate explosives.) The 20 bombs may not eliminate the offices completely, but they should take care of demoralizing the 29,000 in the lower ranks and punch a number of holes in the surviving subtrees.

Let's assume the 20 bomb-builders die during the bombing or remain to pick off survivors and obstruct rescue services as long as possible.

What shall we do with our remaining 15 agents? The offices lay in ruins. The corporate lords are dead. The lower ranks are running around in utter confusion, with long-oppressed subordinates waking to realize that CEO is a live possibility. The rivals have been taking advantage of GS's disarray as much as possible (although likely the markets would be in the process of shutting down).

15 is almost enough to assign one per office. What else could one do besides attack the office and its contents? Data centers are a good choice, but hardware is very replaceable and attacking them might impede the rivals' efforts. One would want to destroy the software GS uses in trading, but to do that one would have to attack the source repositories; those are likely either in the offices already or difficult to trace. (You'll notice that we haven't assigned our fanatics anything particularly difficult or subtle so far. I do this to try to make it seem as feasible as possible; if I had fanatics becoming master hackers and infiltrating GS's networks to make disastrous trades that bankrupt the company, people might say 'aw, they may be fanatically motivated, but they couldn't *really* do that'.)

It's not enough to simply damage GS once. We must attack on the psychological plane: we must make it so that people fear to ever work for GS again.

Let us postulate one of our 15 agents was assigned a research task. He was to get the addresses of all GS employees. (We may have already needed this for our surgical strike.) He can do this by whatever mean: being hired by GS's HR department, infiltrating electronically, breaking in and stealing random hard drives, [open source intelligence](!Wikipedia) - whatever. Where there's a will, there's a way.

Divvy the addresses up into 14 areas centered around offices, and assign the remaining 14 agents to travel to each address in their area and kill anyone there. A man may be willing to risk his own life for fabulous gains in GS - but will he risk his family? (And families are easy targets too. If the 14 agents begin before the main attacks, it will be a while before the Goldman Sachs link becomes apparent. Shooting someone is easy; getting away with it is the hard part.)

I would be shocked if Goldman Sachs could survive even half the agents.

The reader will object that this is absurd. An intellectual game. Which it is. Where are 100 humans who would not flinch at such cold-blooded mass murder, who will devote unceasing years to the mission, who will live on $1 of bulgur pilaf a day to save money for bombs & bribes?

That is the point. There is a very large gap between what we will do and what we can do.

One common anti-IQ arguments is that IQ does nothing and may be actively harmful past 120 or 130 or so; the statistical evidence is there to support a loss of correlation with success, and commentators can adduce [William Sidis](!Wikipedia) if they don't themselves know any such 'slackers', or the [Terman report](!Wikipedia)'s similar findings.

This is a reasonable objection. But it is rarely proffered by people really familiar with IQ, who also rarely respond to it. Why? I believe they have an intuitive understanding that IQ is a *percentile ranking*, not an *absolute measurement*.

It is plausible that the 20 points separating 100 and 120 represents far more cognitive power and ability than that separating 120 and 140, or 140 and 160. To move from 100 to 120, one must surpass roughly 20% of the population; to move from 120 to 140 requires surpassing a smaller percentage, and 140-160 smaller yet.

Similarly it should make us wonder how much absolute ability is being measured at the upper ranges when we reflect that, while adult IQs are stable over years, they are unstable in the short-term and test results can vary dramatically even if there is no distorting factors like emotional disturbance or varying caffeine consumption.

Another thought: the kids in your local [special ed](!Wikipedia) program mentally closer to chimpanzees, or to Albert Einstein/[Terence Tao](!Wikipedia)? Pondering all the things we expect even special ed kids to learn (eg. language), I think those kids are closer to Einstein than monkeys.

And if retarded kids are closer to Einstein that the smartest non-human animal, that indicates human intelligence is very 'narrow', and that there is a vast spectrum of stupidity stretching below us all the way down to viruses (which only 'learn' through evolution).

A gap like 20 points looks very impressive from our compressed human perspective, but it reflects very little absolute difference; to a sheep, other sheep are each distinctive. In [Big O](!Wikipedia) computer terms, we might say that geniuses are a [constant factor](!Wikipedia) faster than their dimmer brethren, but not [asymptotically](!Wikipedia) so.

It is expected then, that someone measured at 180 doesn't make the rest of us look like a retard of 20. To be so smart requires thousands of factors (mental & biological) to click just right; if ordinary people luck out on 900 factors, then those geniuses' scores are trying to secern differences of 2 or 3 factors, and the practical impact of a few factors out of thousands may be minimal and explain the findings without denying the existence of such differences.

My little sister Molly went to Hawkin's Path Elementary much the same as all of us did. Early on, one morning before classes began, she went to the cafeteria and got on the line for the breakfasts. Pretty much the only people who ate breakfast at Hawkin's Path were the (very) poor kids who qualified for the Federal free breakfast program. Molly, as it happens, was neither on the list nor had a card. But the lunch lady was new to the job & school, so when her turn came up, she said, "I'm Molly!" with such straightforwardness and assurance - as though *of course* that explained everything, who didn't know Molly? - that the flummoxed lady simply gave her a breakfast.

Some time later, Molly's kindergarten teacher Mrs. MacNamara would approach Mom & Dad at a book fair (or something) and shock them by inquiring as to whether Molly qualified for the program.

One curious event, that well illustrates the uncanny hold that coincidences can exert on our minds, is worth recording. One day, I had read part of Frank Herbert's _Dune_ and run into the word 'spannungsbogen' - a kind of self-discipline or restraint as Herbert described it. The word had an entry in [Wiktionary](!Wikipedia) but the entry lacked sources & examples, and was at risk of deletion. So I went to one of my favorite sources - _The New York Times_ - and searched their archives, found one useful hit (later, I would not remember anything about what the hit said; just that it existed), and listed it on the talk page (since I'm not familiar with Wiktionary conventions and prefer to let the regulars integrate new references into entries).

Then I woke up.

Some time later, I remembered the dream and thought to myself that I ought to check whether I had not actually added it yesterday and was mis-remembering; I had not - the talk page was devoid of my contribution - but the entry did need work. I then thought it would be amusing to see what the NYT *did* have, so I went and searched - and found one useful hit. Disquieted, I edited the talk page as in my dream, and moved on.

Consider the plight of an upload - a human mind running on a computer rather than a brain. It has the advantage of all digital data: perfect fidelity in replication, fast replication - replication period. An upload could well be immortal. But an upload is also very fragile. It needs storage at every instance of its existence, and it needs power for every second of thought. It doesn't carry with it any reserves - a bit is a bit, there are no bits more durable than other bits, nor bits which carry small batteries or [UPSes](!Wikipedia "Uninterruptable power supply") with themselves.

So reliable backups are literally life and death for uploads.

But backups are a double-edged sword for uploads. If I backup my photos to [Amazon S3](!Wikipedia) and a bored employee pages through them, that's one thing; annoying or  career-ending as it may be, pretty much the worst thing that could happen is that I get put in jail for a few decades for child pornography. But for an upload? If an enemy got a copy of its full backups, the upload has essentially been kidnapped. The enemy can now run copies and torture them for centuries, or use them to attack the original running copy (as hostages, in [false flag attacks](!Wikipedia), or simply to understand & predict what the original will do). The negative consequences of a leak are severe.

So backups need to be both reliable and secure. These are conflicting desires, though.

One basic principle of long-term storage is '[LOCKSS](!Wikipedia)': "lots of copies keeps stuff safe". Libraries try to distribute copies of books to as many holders as possible, on the premise that each holder's failure to preserve a copy is a random event independent of all the other holders; thus, increasing the number of holders can give arbitrarily high assurances that *a* copy will survive. But the more copies, the more risk one copy will be misused. That's fine if 'misuse' of a book is selling it to a book collector or letting it rot in a damp basement; but 'misuse' of a conscious being is unacceptable.

Suppose one encrypts the copies? Suppose one uses a [one-time pad](!Wikipedia), since one worries that an encrypted copy which is bullet-proof *today* may be copied and saved for centuries until the encryption has been broken, and is perfectly certain the backups are 'secure'. Now one has 2 problems: making sure the backups survive until one needs them, and making sure the one-time pad survives as well! If the future upload is missing either one, nothing works.

The trade-off is unfortunate, but let's consider secure backups. The first and most obvious level is physical security. Most systems are highly vulnerable to attackers who have physical access; desktop computers are trivially hacked, and [DRM](!Wikipedia) is universally a failure.

Any backup ought to be as inaccessible as possible. [Security through obscurity](!Wikipedia) might work, but let's imagine *really* inaccessible backups. How about hard drives in orbit? No, that's too close: commercial services can reach orbit easily, to say nothing of governments. And orbit doesn't offer too much hiding space. How about orbit not around the Earth, but around the Solar System? Say, past the orbit of Pluto?

That offers an enormous volume: the Kuiper Belt is roughly ~1.95^30^ cubic kilometers[^volume]. The lightspeed delay is at least 20 minutes, but [latency](!Wikipedia) isn't an issue; a backup protocol on Earth could fire off one request to an orbiting device and the device would then transmit back everything it stored without waiting for any replies or confirmations (somewhat like [UDP](!Wikipedia)).

10^30^ cubic kilometers is more than enough to hide small stealthy devices in. But once it sends a message back to Earth, its location has been given away - the Doppler effect will yield its velocity and the message gives its location at a particular time. This isn't enough to specify its orbit, but it cuts down significantly on where the device could be. 2 such messages and the orbit is known. A restore would require more than 2 messages.

The device could self-destruct after sending off its encrypted payload. But that is very wasteful. We want the orbit to change unpredictably after each broadcast.

If we imagine that at each moment the device chooses between firing a thruster to go 'left' or 'right', then we could imagine the orbit as being a message encrypted with a one-time pad - a one-time pad, remember, being a string of random bits. The message is the original orbit; the one-time pad is a string of random bits shared by Earth and the device. Given the original orbit, and knowing when and how many messages have been sent by the device, Earth can compute what the new orbit is and where the device will be in the future. ('It started off on this orbit, then the random bit-string said at time X to go left, then at X+1, go left again, then at X+Y, go right; remembering how fast it was going, that means it should now be... there in the constellation of Virgo.')

The next step up is a symmetric cipher: a shared secret used not to determine future orbit changes, but to send messages back and forth - 'go this way next; I'm going this way next; start a restore' etc. But an enemy can observe where the messages are coming from, and can work out that 'the first message must've been X, since if it was at point N and then showed up at point O, only one choice fits, which means this encrypted message meant X, which lets me begin to figure out the shared secret'.

A public-key system would be better: the device encrypts all its messages against Earth's private key, and vice versa. Now the device can randomly choose where to go and tell Earth its choice so Earth knows where to aim its receivers and transmitters next.

But can we do better?

[^volume]: The area of a sphere is given by the equation: $\frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times r^3$\
       1 AU = $149.60 \times 10^6$ kilometers\
       30 AU = $30 \times 149.60 \times 10^6$, or $4.488 \times 10^9$ km\
       55 AU = $55 \times 149.60 \times 10^6$, or $8.228 \times 10^9$ km\
       So the shell is the volume of the outer sphere minus the inner sphere:\
       $(\frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times (8.228 \times 10^9)^3) - (\frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times (4.488 \times 10^9)^3)$, or $1.9546466984296578 \times 10^{30}$.

After several years, I finished reading Seidensticker's translation of _[The Tale of Genji](!Wikipedia). Many thoughts occurred to me towards the end, when the novelty of the Heian era began to wear off and I could be more critical.

The prevalence of poems & puns is quite remarkable. It is also remarkable how tired they all feel; in _Genji_, poetry has lost its magic and has simply become another stereotyped form of communication, as codified as a letter to the editor or small talk. I feel fortunate that my introductions to Japanese poetry have usually been small anthologies of the greatest poets; had I first encountered court poetry through _Genji_, I would have been disgusted by the mawkish sentimentality & repetition.

The gender dynamics are remarkable. Toward the end, one of the two then main characters becomes frustrated and casually has sex with a serving lady; it's mentioned that he liked sex with her better than with any of the other servants. Much earlier in _Genji_ (it's a good thousand pages, remember), Genji simply rapes a woman, and the central female protagonist, Murasaki, is kidnapped as a girl and he marries her while still what we would consider a child. (I forget whether Genji sexually molests her before the _pro forma_ marriage.) This may be a matter of non-relativistic moral appraisal, but I get the impression that in matters of sexual fidelity, rape, and children, Heian-era morals were not much different from my own, which makes the general immunity all the more remarkable. (This is the 'shining' Genji?) The double-standards are countless.

The power dynamics are equally remarkable. Essentially every speaking character is nobility, low or high, or Buddhist clergy (and very likely nobility anyway). The characters spend next to no time on 'work' like running the country, despite many main characters ranking high in the hierarchy and holding ministral ranks; the Emperor in particular does nothing except party. All the households spend money like mad, and just expect their land-holdings to send in the cash. (It is a signal of their poverty that the Uji household ever even mentions how less money is coming from their lands than used to.) The Buddhist clergy are remarkably greedy & worldly; after the death of the father of the Uji household, the abbot of the monastery he favored sends the grief-stricken sisters a note - which I found remarkably crass - reminding them that he wants the customary gifts of valuable textiles.

The medicinal practices are utterly horrifying. They seem to consist, one and all, of the following algorithm: 'while sick, pay priests to chant.' If chanting doesn't work, hire more priests. (One freethinker suggests that a sick woman eat more food.) Chanting is, at least, not outright harmful like bloodletting, but it's still sickening to read through *dozens* of people dying amidst chanting. In comparison, the bizarre superstitions (such as trapping them in houses on inauspicious days) that guide many characters' activities are unobjectionable.

The 'ending' is so abrupt, and so clearly unfinished; many chapters have been spent on the 3 daughters of the Uji householder, 2 are disposed of, and the last one has just been discovered in her nunnery by 1 of the 2 protagonists (and the other protagonist suspects). The arc is not over until the would-be nun has been confronted, yet the book ends. Given that Murasaki Shikibu was writing an episodic entertainment for her court friends, and the overall lack of plot, I agree with Seidensticker that the abrupt mid-sentence ending is due either to Shikibu dying or abandoning her tale - not to any sort of deliberate plan.

How does one make a sand hourglass measure multiple times?

One could just watch it and measure fractions by eye - when a 10-minute timer is down to 1/2, it has measured 5 minutes. One could mark the outside and measure fractions that way.

Or perhaps one could put in two-toned sand - when the white has run out and there's only black sand, then 5 minutes has passed.

But the sand would inevitably start to mix, and then you just have a 10-minute timer with grey sand. Perhaps some sort of plastic sheet separating them? But it would get messed up when it passes through the funnel.

Then, perhaps the black sand could be magnetically charged positively, and the white sand negatively? But magnetism attracts *unlike*. If the black is positive and white negative, they'll clump together even more effectively than random mixing would.

We can't make a color homogeneous in charge. Perhaps we could charge just black negative, and put positive magnets at the roof and floor? The bias might be enough over time to counteract any mixing effect - the random walk of grains would have a noticeable bias for black. But if the magnet is strong, then some black sand would never move, and if it's weak, then most of the sand will never be affected; either way, it doesn't work well.

Perhaps we could make half the black sand positive and half negative, while all white is neutral? Black will clump to black everywhere in the hourglass, without any issues about going through the funnel or affecting white.

How might this fail? Well, why would there be only *2* layers? There could be several alternating layers of black and white, and this be a stable system.

We might be able to remedy this by combining magnetized black sand with magnets on the roof/floor, imparting an overall bias - the layers form, but slowly get compacted together.

The real question is whether strong enough magnetism to usefully sort is also so strong to clump together and defeat the gravity-based timing.

People can be awfully suspicious of free lunches. I'd like to try a little experiment or stunt sometime to show this. Here's how it'd go.

I'd grab myself a folding table, make a big poster saying 'Free Money! $1 or $2' and in fine print, 'one per person per day'. Then, anyone who came up and asked would get $2. Eventually, someone would ask for $1 - they would get it, but be asked first *why* they declined the larger amount.

I think their answers would be interesting.

Even funner would be giving the $2 as a 2-dollar bill, and not 2 dollar bills. They're rare enough that it would be quite a novelty to people.

Today I noted to my grandfather Gerald Birch that a lot of the most local Marylanders seem to have both pick-up trucks and dogs in the cabs. He told me an anecdote about his cousin Dill's life was saved by this habit.

One day Dill was driving down a road with his dog. For whatever reason, he goes wild into the woods and crashes and is knocked unconscious. His dog, more sensible than he, picked itself up and walked out to the road, where it then sat down and waited.

Eventually, some friends of Dill came driving by and recognized the dog instantly. "What's Dill's dog doing sitting there?" they asked one another as they stopped and got out. This led to them going into the woods where they found Dill in his wreck.

Once, after the RIT anime club, I got into a heated argument with another fellow. He and I had a running series of insults and arguments (often centering on how I had a problem with his face).

At some point, I asserted that there is nothing funny about child abuse!

He begged to differ.

Very well, then, said I, tell me a funny child abuse joke. He craved 5 minutes, which I readily granted.

4 minutes in, he lifted his head from deep in thought and told me the following joke:

"What's more fun than beating your child with a board game?"

"I don't know."

"Beating them with anything else."

I paused, and then conceded defeat.

A teacher of mine, although for the life of me I cannot remember where or whom, once told the class a story about European customs.

When he was a younger man, he said, he once was in a restaurant in Amsterdam, when a fellow American walked in. She was a beautiful young woman and the teacher noticed her immediately, as did the virile waiters.

She walked to one of the bistro's tables and sat down, clearly expecting to be served. The waiters were greedily looking at her from over in their corner, but making no move.

It is the custom, the teacher explained, that in America, the waiter accosts the customer but vice versa in Europe. They were at an impasse. It was amusing, he said - one wanted to be served and the other to serve.

The young lady's impatience boiled over after a score of minutes, and she left, much to the dismay of the waiters. And all for want of a nail.

One thing I was known for in Boy Scouts (or so I thought) was my trick of cooking hamburgers with leaves rather than racks or pans. I had learned it long ago at a campboree, and made a point of cooking my hamburger that way and not any other.

The way it works is you take several large green leafs straight from the tree, and sandwich your burger. Ideally you only need 2, one leaf on top and the other on bottom. (I was originally taught using just one leaf, and carefully flipping the burger on top of its leaf, but that's error prone - one bad flip and your burger is irretrievably dirty and burned.) Then you put your green sandwich on top of a nice patch of coals - no flames! - and flip it in 10 minutes or so.

You'll see it smoke, but not burn. The green leaves themselves don't want to burn, and the hamburger inside is giving off lots of water, so you don't need to worry unless you're overcooking it. At about 20 minutes, the leaves should have browned and you can pull it out and enjoy.

What's the point of this? Well, it saves one dishes. Given how difficult it is to clean dishes out there where there are no dishwashers or sinks, this should not be lightly ignored. It cooks better: much more evenly and with less char or burning of the outside. Given many scouts' cooking skills, this is no mean consideration either. It's a much more interesting way to cook. And finally, the hamburger ends up with a light sort of 'leafy' taste on the outside, which is quite good and not obtainable any way else.

Junior year of high school, I went on a trip to Europe - London, Paris, Bruges, Amsterdam. Quite excellent, even though I was 1 of 2 guys on it, and the girls insisted on shopping and on eating at McDonald's on the Champs-Élysées; but that's a different story.

In Amsterdam, we took an excursion out to a model Dutch farm. It was muddy. And very flat.

While there, I bought some Dutch cheese which was really fantastic and which I later wolfed down and thoughtlessly discarded the wrappers so I have no idea what kind it was and so can never have it again, and some wooden clogs. The machine which carves them out of wood was interesting, I thought, and I'm of Dutch descent myself, so I sort of had an obligation to get some wooden shoes while in Holland.

The shoes were pretty freshly carved, and quite wet (while the machine is carving a shoe, you can see the water gush out, that's how wet the wood is), so I was standing around outside at the end with them in a bag. I began to ponder aloud how to paint them. I ultimately decided to paint them neon orange, with vivid black and white tiger stripes. (Don't laugh; we were all young upon a time.)

Standing with me, in his black Franciscan robes, was Brother Joshua. He was then, and still is so far as I know, the Dean of Discipline. He handled a lot of student infractions or detentions, and was an object of fear to everyone except his choir classes.

He heard my plans with bemusement, and much to my surprise, said that if I actually carried out my plan and didn't just put the shoes on a shelf in the attic, he would personally give me permission to violate the school dress code and wear the clogs to classes.

I was thrilled, and many days later, after flying to London and back home, I went to Home Depot, bought the spray paints and lacquers, and began work...

I had given Brother Joshua no warning; just showed up in the main office one morning and found him in his office, proffered the bright orange (they were not neon, but a more satisfyingly tiger-y orange) clogs, and grinned. He shook his head - he remembered full well his promise - and wrote out a small note for me.

I immediately put on the wooden shoes and stomped quietly out. I made a point in class of crossing my legs and sticking them out of my desk, and using my free period to walk down the stairs and up the hallways. Some of my consoeurs from the trip remembered the bargain and congratulated me on filling it. I was stopped by a teacher only once. That was, I think, my single best day at St. Anthony's.

Grandma Birch once recounted how uncle Tom had beautiful hair as a child which she refused to allow be cut; one day, Grandad Birch took him to have it cut anyway while she was away. That same day, uncle Tom was playing in the street when a local girl ran into him with her car, hurtling him back up onto the lawn and leaving a scar on his face that one can still see as a dimple.

When she returned, she remembers that her chief concern was what had been done to his beautiful hair!

Aunt Sally recounted 2 stories.

One of her elementary school colleagues was named 'Thomas Magwood'. She asked him whether anyone had called him Maggy Maggot. He answered yes. She wondered which student. Magwood replied: 'My granddaughter.' Aunt Sally: 'Thomas, I was not expecting that answer.'

Another student had lost her father while young, and one day was asking where he had gone. Her mother eloquently spoke of how he now lived on in their hearts and would remain in their house forever. The child acquiesced, and some time later, announced that she had remembered her father's name. What is it, the mother asked. Quite firmly she replied: 'Jesus.'

> How do you justify anime/manga as a hobby? I catch a lot of flak and because of that tend to hide my hobby from others.

I justify it as following: my interlocutor probably consumes American pop culture and has an argument for its value (let's call its value AV); anime is Japanese pop culture (call its value JV); even if it is merely only as good as American pop culture, it carries educational value sheerly from its origin (call educational value EV). Obviously, if AV=JV, then JV+EV>AV (just as x < x+1).

Any arguer must prove that Japanese pop culture is either not educational in any way (an obvious falsehood), that it is so much worse than American pop culture that it more than undoes the educational value (a tough row to hoe), or that pop culture in general is valueless (a position which exposes the arguer to charges of hypocrisy).

Most people wouldn't appreciate this reasoning, so I don't justify it at all usually, and just say _de gustibus non est disputandum_.

> So basically, you believe that for one to argue that Jpop culture is detrimental to ones intellect is an obvious falsehood?

Well, it's either false, or it's trivially used against them. 'And why do you think American pop culture is not equally or even more toxic for one's mind?' So no intelligent person would try to take that route.

Night watch is not devoid of intellectual interest. The night is quite beautiful in its own right, and during summer, I find it superior to the day. It is cooler, and often windier. Contrary to expectation, it is less buggy than the day. Fewer people are out, of course.

My own paranoia surprises me. At least once a night, I hear noises or see light, and become convinced that someone is prowling or seeks to break in. Of course, there is no one there. This is true despite it being my 4th year. I reflect that if it is so for me, then what might it be like for a primitive heir to millennia of superstition? There is a theory that spirits and gods arise from overly active imaginations, or pattern-recognition as it is more charitably termed. My paranoia has made me more sympathetic to this theory. I am a staunch atheist, but even so!

The tempo at night varies as well. It seems to me that the first 2 years, cars were coming and going every night. Cars would meet, one would stay and the other go; or a car would enter the lot and not leave for several days (with no one inside); or they would simply park for a while. School buses would congregate, as would policecars, sometimes 4 or 5 of them. In the late morning around 5 AM, the tennis players would come. Sometimes when I left at 8 AM, all 4 or 5 courts would be busy - and some of the courts hosted 4 players. I would find 5 or 6 tennis balls inside the pool area, and would see how far I could drop-kick them. Now, I hardly ever find tennis balls, since I hardly ever see tennis players. A night in which some teenagers congregate around a car and smoke their cigarettes is a rarity. Few visit my lot.

I wonder, does this have to do with the recession which began in 2008?

Philosophy [two-cows](!Wikipedia "You have two cows") jokes:

Free will: you have 2 cows; in an event entirely independent of all previous events & predictions, they devour you alive; this makes no sense as cows are herbivores, but you are no longer around to notice this.

Fatalism: you have 2 cows; whether they survive or not is entirely up to the inexorable course of the universe, and what you do or not likewise, so you don't feed your cows and they starve to death; you reflect that apparently the universe really has it in for you.

Compatibilism: you have 1 cow which is free and capable of making decisions, and 1 cow that is determined and bound to follow the laws of physics; they are the same cow. But you get 2 cows' worth of milk anyway.

Existentialism: You have two cows; one is a metaphor for the human condition.

Ethics: You have two cows, and as a Utilitarian, does it suit the best interests of yourself and both cows to milk them, or could it be said that the interests of yourself, as a human, come above those of the cows, who are, after all, inferior to the human race? Aristotle would claim that this is correct, although Peter Singer would disagree.

Sorites: you have 2 cows who produce a bunch of milk; but if you spill a drop, it's still a bunch of milk; and so on until there's no more milk left. Obviously it's impossible to have a bunch of milk, and as you mope over how useless your cows are, you die of thirst.

Nagarjuna: You have 2 cows; they are 'empty', of course, since they are dependent on grass; you milk them and get empty-milk (dependent on the cow), which taste empty; you sell them both and go get some real cows.

Descartes: You have 2 cows, therefore you are (since deceive me howbeit the demon may, he can never make it so that I have 2 cows yet am not); further, there are an infinite # of 2-cows jokes, and where could this conception of infinity have come from but God? Therefore he exists. You wish you had some chocolate milk.

Bentham: no one has a natural right to anything, since that would be '2 cows walking upon stilts'; everything must be decided by the greatest good for the greatest number; you get a lobotomy and spend the rest of your life happily grazing with your 2 cows.

Tocqueville: Cows are inevitable, so we must study the United Cows of America; firstly, we shall take 700 pages to see how this nation broke free of the English Mooarchy, and what factors contributes to their present demoocracy...

Gettier: You see 2 cows in your field - actually, what you see is 2 cow-colored mounds of dirt, but there really are 2 cows over there; when you figure this out, your mind is blown and >2000 years of epistocowlogy shatters.

Heidegger: dasein dasein apophantic being-in cow being-in-world milk questioning proximate science thusly Man synthesis time, thus, 2 cows.

Husserl: You have 2 cows, but do you really see them?

Writing ideas:

w/r/t existential threats, when is it a better idea to bomb failed nations/continents back to the stone age? http://lesswrong.com/lw/1qf/the_craigslist_revolution_a_realworld_application/1lud?c=1

In neuroscience, there's a model of consciousness called the 'workspace' model. The idea is that the various modules in the brain, like the auditory or visual or long-term memory modules normally operate on their own, doing their things, predicting & perceiving what they can; but sometimes something goes wrong: the predictions are suddenly all wrong, or there's unusual & urgent input. The modules panic and emit a summary of the situation over to the single global workspace, where it sits side by side with all the other summaries, and the slow linear prefrontal cortex ponders all the situations & weighs their importance (perhaps issuing some requests to various memories) & sends out orders. In other words, one is only conscious when there is conflict between modules; otherwise, one is unconscious and the modules continue their work. When carrying a dish from the kitchen to the table, one is largely unconscious - one isn't really thinking, one can't remember much, because not much is happening in consciousness. But if the plate is burning hot? Then all of a sudden there is conflict: the arm neurons are frantically trying to execute the 'flinch' reflex, another part is frantically saying don't drop it we're almost there! and the multiple summaries arrive in consciousness, one suddenly 'wakes up' and decides to drop it or not to drop it, and the deed is done.

Why do people ride roller-coasters? Why do they go into haunted houses? They say it makes them feel alive, that it's vivid and unusual, that it's very exciting.. That it wakes them up.

TODO: there's some general essay I could write about FMA, especially the manga versus anime+movie

> What do you think about Mustang using the philosopher's stone entirely to get his vision back?

Kosher. Mustang didn't ask to see the Gate, and that stone would otherwise have been wasted. He didn't merit his punishment.

> About him not taking the seat as the fuhrer?

With the corrupt establishment toppled, there's no longer any compelling reason for him to be fuhrer. Indeed, his personal failings may mean that it's better for him to not be fuhrer. (What would he do?)

> Ed transmuting the literal gate to break the rules?

That wasn't rule-breaking; that was awesome. It was tremendously satisfying.

One of FMA's running themes was the narrowness of those interested in alchemy. They were interested in it, in using it, in getting more of it. Obviously folks like Shou Tucker or Kimbly sold their soul for alchemy, but less obviously, the other alchemists have been corrupted to some degree by it. Even heroes like Izumi or the Elrics transgressed. Consider Mustang; his connection with Hawkeye was alchemy-based, and only after years did the connection blossom. Consider how little time he spent with Hughes, in part due to his alchemy-based position. Mustang didn't learn until Hughes was gone just how much his friends meant.

Similarly, Greed. His epiphany at the end hammers in the lesson about the value of friends. How did he lose *his* friends? By pursuit of alchemy-based methods of immortality.

That is why Ed was the real hero. Because he realized the Truth of FMA: your relationships are what really matter. No alchemist ever escaped the Gate essentially intact before he did. Why? Because it would never even occur to them to give up their alchemy or what they learned at the Gate.

Have you ever heard of a monkey trap made of a hole and a collar of spikes sticking down? The monkey reaches in and grabs the fruit inside, but his fist is too big to pass back out. If only the stupid monkey would let go of the fruit, he could escape. But he won't. And then the hunter comes.

The alchemists are the monkey, alchemy is the fruit, and the Truth is the hunter. The monkeys put the fruit above their lives, because they think they can have it all. Ed doesn't.

(Were there things I disliked? Yes, the whole god thing struck me as strange and ill-thought out. I also disliked the mechanism for alchemy of some sort of Earth energy. I thought that the idea that alchemy was powered by deaths in an alternate Earth to really fit the whole theme of Equivalent Exchange - TANSTAAFL. As it is, alchemy turns out to be a free lunch.)

21:47:59 < gwern> I often think that cat psychology is harder than dog psychology
21:48:14 < gwern> then I reflect that dogs have co-evolved with us for much longer than cats, and dogs have bigger brains as well
21:48:15 < cwillu> no, the dominance hierarchy is firmly established
21:48:25 < gwern> so maybe I only think I understand dogs
21:49:08 < gwern> perhaps under the evolved tricks like eye-following or pointing-understand lies a psychology as or more alien than cats
21:49:23 < gwern> *pointing-understanding
21:49:36 < AngryParsley> cat psychology is that they do whatever the hell they want

> The absence of rule of law, democratic checks on the military, continual conflict and overall incompetence also increases the chances lab error or misuse of high tech weaponry as technology become more accessible while social, economic and political conditions do not improve.

I just had a fun idea: take this premise, and the demonstrated difficulty of improving Africa, and the idea that the development vs. likeliness-to-screw-everybody-over-with-WMDs curve would be an inverted U, and calculate the point at which it would be better to cut off all aid & begin bombing Africa into (or within) the Stone Age.

> There a high moral cost to beginning bombing Africa.

There is no moral cost by definition; at the point at which we would want to start bombing, the immoral thing is to not bomb. We've bombed many countries for far less than existential threats (arguably, every US bombing campaign back to WWII).

Further, I think you drastically overestimate the chances of homegrown terrorism. Vietnam was long ago. Reports like millions of Iraqi refugees or hundreds of thousands of excess Iraqi deaths merely spark muted partisan arguments about whether the Lancet's statistics are right or not. It's a long way to Tipperary.

> The Global economy would tailspin and the existential risk situation would get a lot worse as a result.

I think you badly overestimate how important Africa is. Even assuming resources cannot be extracted while also bombing the place, Africa isn't that important.

The continental GDP is just 2.7 trillion. Several percent of that is foreign aid (https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/EconomyofAfrica) and their exports to the rest of the world are small enough that their balance of payments (with the rest of the world) is negative by billions (http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/data-statistics/).

Now, if Africa disappeared or was suddenly destroyed, I would expect the global financial markets to drop considerably; but they are so skittish they drop at the fall of a hat. The long-term economic impact wouldn't be so bad outside of commodities like coltan. Certainly not so bad as some grey goo getting loose.

(I'd count things like AIDS as further debits to Africa, but obviously that's a sunk cost as far as this suggestion is concerned.)

'King Krryllok stated that Crustacistan had submitted a preliminary indictment of Gary Krug, "the butcher of Boston", laying out in detail his systematic genocide of lobsters, shrimp, and others conducted in his Red Lobster franchisee; international law experts predicted that Krug's legal team would challenge the origin of the records under the poisoned tree doctrine, pointing to news reports that said records were obtained via industrial espionage of Red Lobster Inc. When reached for comment, Krug evinced confusion and asked the reporter whether he would like tonight's special on fried scallops'

My theory is that humor is when there is a connection between the joke & punchline which is obvious to the person in retrospect, but not initially.

Hence, a pun is funny because the connection is unpredictable in advance, but clear in retrospect; Eliezer's joke about the motorist and the asylum inmate is funny because we were predicting some other response other than the logical one; similarly for 'why did the duck cross the road? to get to the other side' is not funny to someone who has never heard any of the road jokes, but to someone who has and is thinking of zany explanations, the reversion to normality is unpredicted.

Your theory doesn't work with absurdist humor. There isn't initially 1 valid decoding, much less 2.

Mm. This might work for some proofs - Lewis Carroll, as we all know, was a mathematician - but a proof for something you already believe that is conducted via tedious steps is not humorous by anyone's lights. Proving P/=NP is not funny, but proving 2+2=3 is funny.

'A man walks into a bar and says "Ow."'

> How many surrealists does it take to change a lightbulb? Two. One to hold the giraffe, and one to put the clocks in the bathtub.

Exactly. What are the 2 valid decodings of that? I struggle to come up with just 1 valid decoding involving giraffes and bathtubs; like the duck crossing the road, the joke is the frustration of our attempt to find the connection.
