If you crack open some of the mustier books about the Internet - you know the ones I'm talking about, the ones which invoke [Roland Barthes](!Wikipedia) and discuss the sexual transgressing of [MUDs](!Wikipedia) - one of the few still relevant criticisms is the concern that the Internet by uniting small groups will divide larger ones.

# Surfing alone

You may remember this as the _[Bowling Alone](!Wikipedia)_ thesis applied to the Internet; it got some traction in the late 1990s. The basic idea is: electronic entertainment devices grows in sophistication and inexpensiveness as the years pass, until by the 1980s and 1990s, they have spread across the globe and have devoured multiple generations of children; these devices are more pernicious than traditional geeky fares inasmuch as they are often best pursued solo. Spending months mastering _[Super Mario Bros](!Wikipedia)_ - all alone - is a bad way to grow up normal.

## And then there were none

The 4 or 5 person _[Dungeons & Dragons](!Wikipedia)_ party (with a [dungeon master](!Wikipedia)) gives way to the classic arcade with its heated duels and oneupsmanship; the arcade gives way to the flickering console in the bedroom with one playing _[Final Fantasy VII](!Wikipedia)_ - alone. The increased graphical realism, the more ergonomic controllers, the introduction of genuinely challenging [AI](!Wikipedia "Artificial intelligence") techniques... Trend after trend was rendering a human opponent unnecessary. And gamer after gamer was now playing alone.

Perhaps, the critic says, the rise of the Internet has ameliorated that distressing trend - the trends favored no connectivity at first, but then there was finally enough surplus computing power and bandwidth for massive connectivity to become the order of the day.

It is much more satisfactory and social to play [MMORPG](!Wikipedia)s on your PC than single-player RPGS, much more satisfactory to kill human players in _[Halo](!Wikipedia "Halo (series)")_ matches than alien AIs. The machines finally connect humans to humans, not human to machine. We're forced to learn some basic social skills, to maintain some connections. We're no longer retreating into our little cocoons, interacting with no humans.

## Welcome to the N.H.K.![^nhk]

But, the critic continues, things still are not well. We are still alienated from one another. The rise of the connected machines still facilitates withdrawal and isolation. It presents the specter of the [_hikkomori_](!Wikipedia "Hikikomori") - the person who ceases to exist in the physical realm as much as possible. It is a Japanese term, of course. They are 5 years further in our future than we are. [Gibson](!Wikipedia "William Gibson") [writes](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/apr/01/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.features), back in 2001:

> "The Japanese seem to the rest of us to live several measurable clicks down the time line. The Japanese are the ultimate Early Adopters, and the sort of fiction I write behooves me to pay serious heed to that. If you believe, as I do, that all cultural change is essentially technologically driven, you pay attention to the Japanese. They've been doing it for more than a century now, and they really do have a head start on the rest of us, if only in terms of what we used to call '[future shock](!Wikipedia)' (but which is now simply the one constant in all our lives)."

Gibson also discusses the 'Mobile Girl' and [text messaging](!Wikipedia); that culture began really showing up in America around 2005[^cell] - [Sidekicks](!Wikipedia "Danger Hiptop"), [Twitter](!Wikipedia) etc. You can do anything with a cellphone: order food, do your job, read & write novels, maintain a lively 'social' life, engage in social status envy ('She has a smaller phone, and a larger collection of collectibles on her cellphone strap! OMG!')... Which is just another way of saying 'You can do anything without seeing people, just by writing digital messages'. (And this in a country with one of the most undigitizable writing systems in existence![^unicode])

[^unicode]: _The [Unicode](!Wikipedia) Standard, Version 5.0_ (the last published as a book) runs to [1472](http://unicode.org/book/aboutbook.html) pages. [ASCII](!Wikipedia) - what most English is written in - is specifiable in a page or two; other popular European languages take only a few more pages. Alphabetic scripts like the Korean [hangul](!Wikipedia) are similarly compactly specified (although hangul's syllable composition means that Unicode has to specify a large alphabet - although clearly and definitely finite - of [11,172](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch12.pdf) syllables.

    In contrast, the desire of the Unicode developers to limit Chinese/Japanese ideograms to 20,940 and then to just 75,960 (so as to not require an extraordinary number of bits to write such ideograms) resulted in a [multi-decade](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/u-secret.html) festering controversy known as [Han unification](!Wikipedia). Said controversy has also encouraged the creation of many other encodings (Wikipedia lists 8 or 9). An outsider might conclude that the complexity of the Unicode solution  and the failure of any competitors to defeat it in [CJKV](!Wikipedia) usage is an indication that the writing systems really truly are not simpatico with digital representation. (I will mention in passing that O'Reilly's - a publisher known for concision and good technical writing - has published a book on working with CJKV text, [_CJKV Information Processing, Second Edition_](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514471), which runs 912 pages.)

    Some people like to relativistically argue that all natural languages are equally complex and such comparisons are meaningless or ignorant (or [racist](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/you-dont-have-a-foreign-language-problem-you-have-an-adult-literacy-problem)). This is obviously false. To demonstrate with [grammatical gender](!Wikipedia); English has very little gender and when an Anglophone learns French, the male/female genders and associated differences in spelling & endings may strike him as superfluous complexity. He's right. The gender rules, and specifically memorizing what gender each and every word is, are arbitrary and convey no meaning. They are random - a compression algorithm would choke on them.

    And we can run a thought experiment (no need to appeal explicitly to [algorithmic information theory](!Wikipedia)); imagine a French Prime which is like French but where there is a *second* gender system with, say, 20 different genders (and accompanying spelling & endings), and for each of the 50,000 words in _[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française](!Wikipedia)_, a [random number generator](!Wikipedia) decides what gender it is. By definition, the output of the RNG is unpredictable & uncompressible. All a Francophone can do is memorize 50,000 gender indications if they are to speak proper French Prime. Surely French Prime is more complex than French - all a French Prime speaker has to do is blissfully forget how many thousands of vigesimal genders he memorized. (If this is not intuitively convincing, then let the number of genders go to 50,000 or however many words there are in a language; the gender rules would be monstrously impossibly complex, with no simplification anywhere in the language.)

The hikkomori withdraws from all personal contact. The hikkomori does not hang out at the local pub, swilling down the brewskis as everyone cheers on the home team. The hikkomori is not gossiping at the rotary club nor with the Lions or mummers or Veterans or Knights. Hikkomoris do none of that. They aren't working, they aren't hanging out with friends.

> "The paradoxical solitude and omnipotence of the _otaku_, the new century's ultimate enthusiast: the glory and terror inherent of the absolute narrowing of personal bandwidth."^[William Gibson, ["Shiny balls of Mud"](http://burningcity.com/gibson_tate.jpg), _TATE_]

So what are they doing with their 16 waking hours a day?

## Opting out

> "But it's better for us not to know the kinds of sacrifices the professional-grade athlete has made to get so very good at one particular thing...the actual facts of the sacrifices repel us when we see them: basketball geniuses who cannot read, sprinters who dope themselves, defensive tackles who shoot up with bovine hormones until they collapse or explode. We prefer not to consider closely the shockingly vapid and primitive comments uttered by athletes in postcontest interviews or to consider what impoverishments in one's mental life would allow people actually to think the way great athletes seem to think. Note the way "up close and personal" profiles of professional athletes strain so hard to find evidence of a rounded human life -- outside interests and activities, values beyond the sport. We ignore what's obvious, that most of this straining is farce. It's farce because the realities of top-level athletics today require an early and total commitment to one area of excellence. An ascetic focus. A subsumption of almost all other features of human life to one chosen talent and pursuit. A consent to live in a world that, like a child's world, is very small.

> [Tennis player Michael] [Joyce](!Wikipedia "Michael Joyce (tennis)") is, in other words, a complete man, though in a grotesquely limited way...Already, for Joyce, at twenty-two, it's too late for anything else; he's invested too much, is in too deep. I think he's both lucky and unlucky. He will say he is happy and mean it. Wish him well."^[[David Foster Wallace](!Wikipedia), ["The String Theory"](http://www.esquire.com/print-this/the-string-theory-0796?page=all), July 1996 _Esquire_]

They're not preoccupied with *our* culture - they're participating in *their* own subculture. It's the natural progression of the [otaku](!Wikipedia). They are fighting on [Azeroth](!Wikipedia), or fiercely pursuing their [dōjinshi](!Wikipedia) 'career', or... There are many subcultures linked and united by the Internet, for good and ill. For every charitable or benevolent subculture (eg. [free software](!Wikipedia)) there is one of mixed benefits (_[World of Warcraft](!Wikipedia)_), and one outright harmful (ex. [fans](!Wikipedia "Pro-ana") of eating disorders, [child pornography](!Wikipedia)).

The point the critic wants to make is that life is short and a [zero-sum](!Wikipedia) game. You lose a third of the day to sleep, another third to making a living, and now you've little left. To be really productive, you can't divide your energies across multiple cultures - you can't be truly successful in mainstream culture, and at the same time be able to devote enough effort in the field of, say, [mechanical models](!Wikipedia "Model robot") to be called an [Otaking](!Wikipedia "Otaku no Video"). A straddler takes onto his head the overhead of learning and participating in both, and receives no benefits (he will suffer socially in the esteem of the 'normals', and will be able to achieve little in his 'hobby' due to lack of time and a desire to not go overboard).[^graham]

The otaku & hikkomori recognizes this dilemma and he chooses - to reject normal life! He rejects life in the larger culture for his subculture. It's a simple matter of [comparative advantage](!Wikipedia); it's easier to be a big fish in a small pond than in a large one.^["My life sucked when I was fifteen.  I was a nobody in the real world.  However, once I was able to create my own character in an online universe, I could be anything or anyone and progress in the game became immediate and instantly gratifying.

## The bigger screen

As ever more opt out, the larger culture is damaged.^[Japan is again our example. [Spike Japan](http://spikejapan.wordpress.com/about/) examined [the decline of karaoke](http://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/kyushu-postscript-a-haikyo-miscellany/), and linked it out to the 'atomized society' by way of time surveys of Japanese citizens showing extraordinary declines in activities like 'talking with family', 'playing sports', and even declines in activities like 'caring for the elderly'.] The culture begins to fragment back into pieces. The disconnect can be profound; an American anime geek has more in common with a Japanese anime geek (who is of a different ethnicity, a different culture, a different religion, a different language...) than he does with an American involved in the evangelical Christian subculture. There is essentially no common ground - our 2 countrymen probably can't even agree on objective matters like governance or evolution!

With enough of these gaps, where is 'American' or 'French' culture? Such cultural identities take centuries to coalesce - France did not speak French until the 1900s (as _[The Discovery of France](!Wikipedia)_ recounts), and Han China is still digesting and assimilating its many minorities and outlying regions. America, of course, had it relatively easy in starting with a small founder population which could just exterminate the natives.

The national identity fragments under the assault of burgeoning subcultures. At last, the critic beholds the natural endpoint of this process: the nation is some lines on a map, some laws you follow. No one particularly cares about it. The geek thinks, '[Meh](!Wikipedia): here, Canada, London, Japan, Singapore - as long as FedEx can reach me and there's a good Internet connection, what's the difference?' (Nor are the technically-inclined alone in this.[^wealthy])

You can test this yourself. Tell yourself - 'The country I live in now is the best country in the world for people like me; I would be terribly unhappy if I was exiled.' If your mental reply goes something like, 'Why, what's so special about the USA? It's not particularly economically or politically free, it's not the only civilized English-speaking country, it's not the wealthiest[^wealth]...', then you are headed down the path of opting out.

This is how the paradox works: the Internet breaks the larger culture by letting members flee to smaller subcultures. And the critics think this is bad. They like the broader culture[^doubt], and deep down, [furries](!Wikipedia "Furry_fandom") and [latex fetishists](!Wikipedia "Latex_and_PVC_fetishism") really bother them. They just plain don't like those weirdo deviants.

# But I can get a higher score!

> "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."[^warhol]

Let's look at another angle.

## Monoculture

> "Irony has only emergency use. Carried over time, it is the voice of the trapped who have come to enjoy their cage."^[Lewis Hyde, _Alcohol and Poetry: John Berryman and the Booze Talking_, pg 90; citation given in ["Michael Kroger, Overcoming Irony: The Creative and Destructive Forces of Chuck Palahniuk's _Choke_"](http://www.uwsp.edu/admin/grantSupport/studentResearch/VolumeV/Kroger.html)]

One can't opt out of culture. "There is no view from nowhere." To a great extent, we are our cultural artifacts - our possessions, our complexes of [meme](!Wikipedia)s, our habits and objects of disgust are all cultural. You are always part of *a* culture.

Suppose there were only 1 worldwide culture, with no subcultures. The overriding obsession of this culture will be... let's make it 'money'. People are absolutely obsessed with money - how it is made, acquired, degraded, etc. More importantly, status is defined just by how much you have earned in your life; in practice, tie-breakers include how fast you made it, what circumstances you made it in (everyone admires a person who became a billionaire in a depression more than a good-times billionaire, in the same way we admire the novelist in the freezing garret more than the comfortable academic), and so on.

This isn't too absurd a scenario: subjects feed on themselves and develop details and complexity as effort is invested in them. Money could well absorb the collective efforts of 7 billion people - already many people act just this way.

But what effect does this have on people? I can tell you: the average person is going to be absolutely miserable. If everyone genuinely buys into this culture, then they have to be. Their talents at piano playing, or cooking, or programming, or any form of artistry or scholarly pursuit are denigrated and count for naught.

To put it another way: women suffer enough from comparing themselves to media images. Imagine a world in which everyone is an anorexic teenager who hates her body - forever.

We all value social esteem. We need to know somebody thinks well of us. We're tribal monkeys; ostracism means death.

Think of the people you know. How many of them can 'compete' on purely financial grounds? How many can compare to the chimps at the top of the financial heap without feeling like an utter failure, a miserable loser? Not many. I can't think of anyone I know who wouldn't be at least a little unhappy. Some of them are pretty well off, but it's awfully hard to compare with billionaires in their department.

## Subcultures set you free

> "If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time."[^desiderata]

Having a society in which an artist can mingle as social equals with the billionaire and admit the Nobel scientists and the philanthropist is fundamental to our mental health! If I'm a programmer, I don't need to be competing with 7 billion people, and the few hundred billionaires, for self-esteem. I can just consider the computing community. Better yet, I might only have to consider the functional programming community, or perhaps just the Haskell programming community. Or to take another example: if I decide to commit to the English Wikipedia subculture, as it were, instead of American culture, I am no longer mentally dealing with 300 million competitors and threats; I am dealing with just a few thousand.[^esr]

[^esr]: This point does not seem to be original to me. [Eric S. Raymond](!Wikipedia) in ["Sex Tips For Geeks: How To Be Sexy"](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/sextips/sexy.html) advises the lovelorn geek to acquire:

    > "Social status. Now this is where it gets interesting -- because women can detect this even when you aren't in a context where it's obvious. Being an alpha male in some status hierarchy changes your body language, your sex-hormone levels, and the smell of your sweat. Women home in on men with these traits something fierce -- ask any rock star.
    >
    > Cathy: _"Or ask Eric. His recent notoriety has definitely increased the amount of female attention he gets -- even from me. :-)"_
    >
    > But it isn't that important to a woman's receptors exactly what the status hierarchy is. It could be anything from the neighborhood bowling league up to the government of a world superpower. Or it could be the developer community of a well-known program. What she smells is success, not the specific kind of success.
    > 
    > In fact this effect is so important in human behavior that males actually form all kinds of odd status hierarchies just so they can have a shot at being top of the heap, even when they know in advance that top-of-the-heap won't convey much in the way of power or wealth reward. Clubs and organized hobbies are like this. The hacker culture itself was purely like this until the late 1990s. At bottom, these are all instinctively founded on sexual-selection games."

It is a more manageable tribe. It's closer to the [Dunbar number](!Wikipedia). Even if I'm on the bottom of the Wikipedia heap, that's fine. As long as I know where I am!

Leaving a culture, and joining a subculture, is a way for the monkey mind to cope with the modern world.

## Growing up

> "Often, I must speak otherwise than I think. That is called diplomacy."[^dune]

I have a theory about why so few older people are hikkomoris or otaku.

I think that they have succumbed to [learned helplessness](!Wikipedia): they've suffered throughout their entire life the fear[^empathy] & stress of walking down a crowded street and having *no idea who all these people are, [what threat they are](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1896), or how they relate to you*, and their minds have been warped to the point that it no longer bothers them, they've simply adapted to the mental burden[^burden]. (As one would expect, young people are more exhausted by groups[^teens].) The remaining mental dislocation is handled by exactly those small-scale social organizations whose passing Putnam bemoans in _Bowling Alone_. (This solution is as viable as it ever was. But the young have other options, and are no longer *forced* into this ancient conformity.)

[^empathy]: ["The power of lonely: What we do better without other people around"](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/03/06/the_power_of_lonely/?page=full) by Leon Neyfakh, _[The Boston Globe](!Wikipedia)_ (6 March 2011)

     > "And it [solitude] can have some counterintuitive effects: Adam Waytz in the Harvard psychology department, one of Cacioppo’s former students, recently completed a study indicating that people who are socially connected with others can have a hard time identifying with people who are more distant from them. Spending a certain amount of time alone, the study suggests, can make us less closed off from others and more capable of empathy — in other words, better social animals."

    This raises an interesting thought. What is more destructive of empathy than stress - or *fear*?
[^burden]: Neyfakh 2011:

     > "Burum found that the participants who had been told the person behind them was doing a different task — namely, identifying sounds rather than looking at pictures — did a better job of remembering the pictures. In other words, they formed more solid memories when they believed they were the only ones doing the task.
     > 
     > ...Burum offers two possible theories to explain what she and Gilbert found in the study. The first invokes a well-known concept from social psychology called “social loafing,” which says that people tend not to try as hard if they think they can rely on others to pick up their slack. (If two people are pulling a rope, for example, neither will pull quite as hard as they would if they were pulling it alone.) But Burum leans toward a different explanation, which is that sharing an experience with someone is inherently distracting, because it compels us to expend energy on imagining what the other person is going through and how they’re reacting to it.
     > 
     > “People tend to engage quite automatically with thinking about the minds of other people,” Burum said in an interview. “We’re multitasking when we’re with other people in a way that we’re not when we just have an experience by ourselves.”
     > 
     > Perhaps this explains why seeing a movie alone feels so radically different than seeing it with friends: Sitting there in the theater with nobody next to you, you’re not wondering what anyone else thinks of it; you’re not anticipating the discussion that you’ll be having about it on the way home. All your mental energy can be directed at what’s happening on the screen."
[^teens]: To quote again Neyfakh 2011:

    > "Teenagers, especially, whose personalities have not yet fully formed, have been shown to benefit from time spent apart from others, in part because it allows for a kind of introspection — and freedom from self-consciousness — that strengthens their sense of identity. Reed Larson, a professor of human development at the University of Illinois, conducted a study in the 1990s in which adolescents outfitted with beepers were prompted at irregular intervals to write down answers to questions about who they were with, what they were doing, and how they were feeling. Perhaps not surprisingly, he found that when the teens in his sample were alone, they reported feeling a lot less self-conscious. “They want to be in their bedrooms because they want to get away from the gaze of other people,” he said.
    >
    > The teenagers weren’t necessarily happier when they were alone; adolescence, after all, can be a particularly tough time to be separated from the group. But Larson found something interesting: On average, the kids in his sample felt better after they spent some time alone than they did before. Furthermore, he found that kids who spent between 25 and 45 percent of their nonclass time alone tended to have more positive emotions over the course of the weeklong study than their more socially active peers, were more successful in school and were less likely to self-report depression."

Stress is an important issue. You can ask the primatologists, they'll tell you. Social stress shortens lives. The monkeys on the bottom of the heap don't live as long as they should; the hormones like [cortisol](!Wikipedia) damage the body[^flowers]. The ape at the top of the heap may not live particularly long either, but at least he can see his death coming. Madness is not associated with the countryside; it is with the city[^madness].

## Special, like everyone else

> "I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him, "Do you know how many people are here right now"? He said since the stadium was full, probably fifty thousand...I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all."[^haruhi]

[Chronic stress](!Wikipedia) is particularly toxic. If the stress is caused by an unclear and extremely low place in the social order, then modern man will constantly suffer it, and his health will be impaired by it.

When one considers this, it's clear that seceding from the culture at large can have benefits that the larger culture can *never* deliver. A larger culture can never reduce the number of people I need to know about to a few hundred or thousand; it can never give me a intuitive place in the scheme of things. 7 billion, or even 300 million, is just too large.

But a subculture can deliver that. A subculture can know my name, and pat me on the back for an achievement that to a larger culture is incomprehensible at best and trivial or objectionable at worst. A subculture can remove that social stress.

And if we were to take it even further? If we chose a subculture that was online, and we never went outside? Then all the stress would be gone; if one doesn't walk down the street, one isn't bothered by strangers in such close proximity.

# Sympathy for the poor devil

> "The secret of [Tokyu Hands](!Wikipedia) is that everything on offer there inclines, ultimately, to the status, if not the perfection, of _[hikaru dorodango](!Wikipedia)_. The brogues, shined lovingly enough, for long enough, with those meticulously imported shoe-care products, must ultimately become a universe unto themselves, a conceptual sphere of lustrous and infinite depth.
>
> Just as a life, lived silently enough, in sufficient solitude, becomes a different sort of sphere, no less perfect."^[Gibson, "Shiny Balls of Mud"]

Society, looked at objectively, has a lot of downsides[^downside]. For anyone who hasn't already bought into society, who isn't perfectly suited for it, becoming a hikkomori is a halfway logical reaction. They have their reasons, and we can even tie the justifications to scientific results.

If someone really prefers their subculture, which gives them mental ease and physical health, then what right do the rest have to interfere and drag them into the main culture? Large homogeneous cultures are accomplished only with great effort, and much bloodshed of body and mind. Their benefits are unclear, and the justifications transparently self-serving. Perhaps we should accept gracefully the inevitable sundering of 'national' cultures, and learn to operate within a truly multicultural world. Each of us with a niche of our own, on respectful (if uncomprehending) terms with all the other subcultures.

Even if that means tolerating furries.

     > "We come at last to madness. Psychiatry has known for decades that the megalopolis — indeed a city of any size — breeds psychosis. In particular, schizophrenia, the paradigm of a purely biological mental illness, becomes more prevalent as city size increases, even when the city is hardly more than a village. And this is the case not because mental illness in general becomes more common in cities; nor is it true that people who are psychotic tend to drift toward cities or stay in them. In creating much larger social groups for ourselves, ranging from true friends to near-strangers, could we be laying the ground for a pathogenic virtual city in which psychosis will be on the rise? Or will Facebook and Twitter draw us closer to friends in Aristotle's sense who can act as psychic prophylaxis against the madness-making power of others? Whatever the effects of the Internet on our inner lives, it seems clear that in changing the structure of our outer lives — the lives intertwined with those of others — the Internet is likely to be a more potent shaper of our minds than we have begun to imagine."

    Poetic enough; here are some [hard numbers](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/179/1/46/TBL1) about the risk factor of cities from a European analysis of [schizophrenia](!Wikipedia) (["Family history, place and season of birth as risk factors for schizophrenia in Denmark: a replication and reanalysis"](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/179/1/46)): a capitol increases your schizophrenia risk by 230% (more than twice!); living in its suburbs ameliorates the risk down to 173%; a city with >100,000 inhabitants brings it down 'merely' to 158%, and so on down to a small city of 10-20,000 with an risk increase of 122%. (These numbers are adjusted for the obvious risks like parental age, gender, and family history, but apparently not for IQ or socioeconomic status.)

[^wealthy]: Consider ["The Rise of the New Global Elite"](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/the-rise-of-the-new-global-elite/8343/), _The Atlantic_, whose author editorializes:

    > "What is more relevant to our times, though, is that the rich of today are also different from the rich of yesterday. Our light-speed, globally connected economy has led to the rise of a new super-elite that consists, to a notable degree, of first- and second-generation wealth. Its members are hardworking, highly educated, jet-setting meritocrats who feel they are the deserving winners of a tough, worldwide economic competition—and many of them, as a result, have an ambivalent attitude toward those of us who didn’t succeed so spectacularly. Perhaps most noteworthy, they are becoming a transglobal community of peers who have more in common with one another than with their countrymen back home. Whether they maintain primary residences in New York or Hong Kong, Moscow or Mumbai, today’s super-rich are increasingly a nation unto themselves."
[^graham]: Consider [Paul Graham's](!Wikipedia "Paul Graham (computer programmer)") essay ["Why Nerds Are Unpopular"](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html):

    > "And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school....

    > ...Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall. In fact, most people who "can draw" like drawing, and have spent many hours doing it; that's why they're good at it. Likewise, popular isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make yourself."
