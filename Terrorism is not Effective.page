One of the mysteries of terrorism not covered in Abrahms's 7 paradoxes is why terrorism has such low death tolls. That is, no terrorist group has achieved a kill rate anywhere approaching a conventional military's; and certainly vastly less than those death tolls ascribable to guerrilla organizations or dictators. (Stalin or Mao could, in a bad day, exceed the deaths caused by all international terrorism over the last 2 centuries; and [9/11](!Wikipedia "September 11 attacks") was equaled by just 29 days' worth of car accidents in the USA[](http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=8598).)

The mystery is that this doesn't have to be the case. Mass murder is quite feasible without the techniques terrorists resort to. We don't even have to resort to speculation to improve on the contemporary terrorist state-of-the-art[^bruce]; history teaches us quite enough.

# Competent murders
The natural comparison, of course, is to private citizens without government backing who set out to kill a lot of people. Or as we call them where I come from, 'mass murderers'; but let's narrow things down: how many people can you kill in a short period of time? Let us consult Wikipedia which -- ever helpful -- has even compiled a sorted list for us: [List of mass murderers and spree killers by number of victims](!Wikipedia).

The all-time record would appear to go to one [Woo Bum-kon](!Wikipedia), who killed 56-62^[You would think that by this point we would know exactly how many!] people, with an honorable mention to [William Unek](!Wikipedia) (57 confirmed kills). The US record goes to [Seung-Hui Cho](!Wikipedia) with 32 kills.

The most striking thing one notices in the entries is how these atrocities rarely involve extremely elaborate preparations, and how minimal the equipment was. Cho had two pistols, bought a few weeks before the Virginia Tech massacre. Bum-kon's Uiryeong massacre was literally on the spur of the moment, when he got drunk after an argument with his girlfriend; somewhat unusually, he had access to grenades via the police, but the grenades arguably did not contribute to the death toll[^bum]. William Unek killed his first 21 people with just an axe. In the [Akihabara massacre](!Wikipedia), Katō had nothing but a rented truck and a knife--and yet, in a large crowd with multiple police on the scene, he *still* managed to kill no less than 7 people and wound 10.

One has the impression that Seung could've finished all his preparations in just a few hours, even counting the trips to the gun store, videos, letters etc.
OK. So this alone suggests that perhaps terrorists are, to put it mildly, adopting suboptimal techniques for killing people. But wait! These are impressive body counts, but maybe terrorists are hoping to win the lottery and achieve a 9/11 attack (even though for every 9/11, there are dozens & hundreds of attacks which kill 10 or 20 people, or even only the terrorist!) . After all, the 19 terrorists averaged 157 kills just in that one attack. That's nearly 3 times Bum-kon's lifetime total.

# Competent soldiers

Now we shift comparisons. Civilians--with minimal preparation, with no training, with nothing special whatsoever about them that grants them unusual killing powers--can kill up to 60 people. What could someone with years of preparation and hundreds of thousands of dollars available^[According to _[The 9/11 Report](!Wikipedia)_, the resources actually expended by al-Qaeda on 9/11 were roughly >$500,000 and 5 years.] do?

Well, I can't answer that. But I can point to an interesting example.
[Simo Häyhä](!Wikipedia) was a Finnish [sniper](!Wikipedia) in the [Winter War](!Wikipedia), when the Soviet Union invaded Finland. He ultimately killed over 542^[Confirmed kills.] Russians, and lived through the war.

Now, Simo was a highly gifted marksman; this is true. But consider the handicaps he labored under: he is fighting in Finland in the depths of an unusually harsh winter; he is subject to military discipline/constraints; he is in the middle of a full-scale conventional war, where life is cheap and death could come at any moment if he is on the wrong side of the shifting boundaries; he is using a relatively old and ordinary bolt-action rifle with iron sights; he is being specifically targeted by the Russians (who are not military incompetents, even after Stalin's purges), who are dispatching their own snipers and artillery squadrons for the sole purpose of killing him; etc.

But a modern sniper can buy the finest rifles on the market, and can confine his activities to temperate areas where he does not need to freeze his tookis while waiting for a shot. He is opposed only by police and paramilitary organizations with no training or even familiarity with counter-sniper weapons and tactics. He can travel anywhere within the country and wait indefinitely for his next attack. As the many historical examples of serial killers teach us, if he is controlled and patient, a man can kill indefinitely even while making close personal contact with the victim and killing in inefficient ways - so how much more so could a sniper picking easy or random targets!

It is no unreasonable to think that a terrorist-sniper could kill indefinitely, at a high tempo. If he shot one person a month, he will exceed Bum-kon in just 5 years. If the 20 9/11 hijackers had instead become snipers, they would at that slow rate match Simo in 2 years or so, and 9/11 in ~12 years. And they could keep on killing. It's not like they have to retire after a decade or two.

# Why not?
## Propaganda, not deaths

So if all these other methods are easier, or more effective, then why do terrorists like hijackings and bombings? One explanation is given by Philip Bobbitt's _Terror and Consent_ -- the [propaganda of the deed](!Wikipedia) is more effective when the killings are spectacular (even if inefficient). But is this really plausible? Try to consider the terrorist-sniper plan I suggest above. Imagine that 20 unknown & anonymous people are, every month, killing one person in a tri-state area. There's no reason, there's no rationale. The killings happen like clockwork once a month. The government is powerless to do anything about it, but their national & local responses are tremendously expensive (as they are hiring security forces and buying equipment like mad). The killings can happen anywhere at any time; last month's was at a Wal-mart in the neighboring town. The month before that, a kid coming out of the library. You haven't even worked up the courage to read about the other 19 slayings last month by this group, and you know that as the month is ending next week another 20 are due. And you also know that this will go on indefinitely, and may even get worse - who's to say this group isn't recruiting and sending more snipers into the country?

Consider the [anthrax attacks](!Wikipedia "2001 anthrax attacks") after 9/11. In my memory, the sheer terror and reflexive jingoism that gripped the country after 9/11 was at least doubled by them. Despite the anthrax attacks killing a tiny percentage of 9/11 (0.002%^[$(5/2974)*100$]), the randomness and duration through time make them much more effective than they should've been. 5 people died of anthrax over the 3 weeks of the anthrax attacks; how much more devastating would it have been if 20 people had died, and the mailings had continued month after month? I think that it would have been much more effective, and that this observation generalizes to my sniper plot[^dc].

## Social factors

If I may, the social explanation (see my "[Terrorism is not about Terror]()") explains much about terrorism, and in particular it explains this oddity. Have you never discussed flipping out or going postal or carrying out a terrorist attack with your friends? Have you noticed that always it is the elaborate and fun-to-discuss attacks you discuss? (Have you noticed how interesting a topic the question "how many people could someone easily kill?" is, how many subject areas it draws upon?)

No terrorist says to himself, I'm going to follow a boring but effective strategy: I'll enlist, get sniper training, and kill a couple hundred civilians - even though  it worked so well for Simo. This kind of strategy would accomplish much more than a regular suicide bombing, but they never do it or any halfway effective strategy. (I refer again to "Why Terrorism doesn't work"; if many terrorists failed to adopt effective strategies, that'd be one thing - but just about all of them? That's a systemic failure which requires a systemic explanation.) They don't want to adopt military discipline, train in sniper tactics and marksmanship for years, and separate permanently.
It'd spoil the fun.

[^bruce]: Although such speculation can be *very* fun and quite educational. I refer the interested reader to the thousands of plots suggested in [Bruce Schneier](!Wikipedia)'s [first](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/06/movieplot_threa_1.html), [second](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/06/second_movieplo.html), [third](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/third_annual_mo_1.html), and [fourth](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/04/fourth_annual_m.html) "Movie-Plot Threat Contests"
[^bum]: Inasmuch as Bum-kon could've killed his victims as effectively with his firearms. His attacks were unopposed by the police and were stopped by his suicide, so Bum-kon could have just shot the <10 people killed by grenades; Wikipedia describes his leisurely massacre thusly:

     > "Initially, he killed three operators at the local telephone exchange to prevent others calling from emergency services. He then walked from house to house and used his position as a police officer to make people feel safe and gain entry into their homes. He shot most of his victims, but in one case he killed an entire family with a grenade. He continued this pattern for a full eight hours.<br>
     > After Woo had shot a number of people in one village, he would resume the spree killing in a nearby village. In the early hours of April 27, after rampaging through five villages in Uiryeong county, Woo took his final two grenades and strapped them to his body. He then held three people captive and then set the grenades' fuses, killing both himself and his final victims."
[^dc]: One possible objection to my sniper plot is that by selecting Simo Häyhä as my exemplar, and suggesting that an indefinite kill-rate of 1 person per month, I am cherry-picking my data; most terrorist-snipers, the suggestion goes, would be more akin to the [Beltway sniper attacks](!Wikipedia) by John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo: resulting in few deaths (11) and relatively quick apprehension (3 weeks). The DC sniper attacks, however, were not conducted at sniper ranges, were multiple killings by the same person in the same time and location, and were conducted poorly--the two were arrested and discovered because they were sleeping in their car (a reason for arrest up there for incompetence with [Timothy McVeigh](!Wikipedia)'s arrest for driving without license plates).
