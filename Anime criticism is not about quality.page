> "How do you justify anime/manga as a hobby? I catch a lot of flak and because of that tend to hide my hobby from others."

One might wonder whether a hobby can be a 'better' hobby than another. Maybe genre preferences is something you just shouldn't argue about, like whether chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla. But it is sensible to think about.

There's no hard-and-fast distinction between a hobby and a job (knitting _[Katamari Damacy](!Wikipedia)_ hats), or a career^[Facebook wasn't incorporated from the get-go, and the 1990s and 2000s are littered with technological giants which started as a hobby such as Linux.], or mere consumption (is 'TV watching' a 'hobby'?), or charity (building houses with Habitat for Humanity), or morality ([learning modern theology](http://commonsenseatheism.com/), discussing issues in utilitarianism^[And speaking of utilitarianism, because hobbies and media consumption use up resources, they are a valid target of critique - 5 or 10 DVD box sets might cost [1 dead baby](http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html).]). 'Hobby' is not a [natural kind](!Wikipedia). No one would question whether you should try to compare jobs, careers, consumption^['You should buy [fair trade](!Wikipedia) chocolate instead of Hershey's!'], or charity^[The entire raison d'etre of [Givewell](!Wikipedia).].

Which of these issues is more important will depend on specifics, of course; the tea connoisseur is more affected by economic & social justice issues, while the job-hunter may worry more about corporate ethics, and the TV watcher may be interested in recommendation algorithms to optimize enjoyability per hour (since there is more to watch than one could [see in a life](Culture is not about esthetics)), or [issues](http://33bits.org/2010/03/15/open-letter-to-netflix/) [of privacy](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html). But there *are* issues to think about.

# A real problem

The question is often posed by anime critics. How to defend watching anime? It's interesting that anime is this popular; you don't hear people asking how to defend their love of [Korean wave](!Wikipedia) movies and soap opera. It wasn't always this way - back in the 1970s, anime was so rare as to not be worth discussing, and even in the 1980s it was a phenomenon limited largely to college campuses where homemade VHS [fansubs](!Wikipedia) could be aired for select enthusiasts.^[I read in the archived text files of one BBS that sometimes when fansubs were unavailable and no one there spoke Japanese, anime clubs might watch an episode *anyway*.]

It seems to be a fact that anime *is* overrepresented in the American market compared to moving picture products of other countries. How many British productions does one see in America, despite England being one of the closest culture to America, despite all their productions being in English by default, despite 70 years of television excellence by the BBC, etc. etc.? Not very many. Or how about [Bollywood](!Wikipedia), one of the most prolific cinemas in the world, active since the 1930s? Or the aforementioned [Korean films](!Wikipedia "Cinema of Korea")? (That the American remake of the critically acclaimed & commercially successful _[Oldboy](!Wikipedia)_ fell through, and the DVD release obscure, only emphasizes the point.)

# Defense
## Endogenous, not exogenous

Perhaps the failure of all non-Japanese sources is due to some market defect. Hollywood is infamous for its accounting standards, less than transparent dealings, and backroom agreements; it is reasonable to suggest that the game has been rigged. Or maybe the market is oversaturated - too many would-be cooks.  But why would either of these not have kept anime/manga at 1970/1980 levels? What exempts them? Or perhaps the Japanese are somehow _simpatico_ with Americans and can specially appeal to the American psyche; but then, why aren't British works cleaning up (surely the British are even closer culturally), and why are [French](!Wikipedia "Manga outside Japan#France") manga sales (with 1/6 the population of America) even stronger than American sales? I know of no explanation, so in the absence of convincing evidence, shouldn't the default argument be that anime/manga is simply a better quality product than the American competitors?

### Why is anime good?

*What* precisely is good about anime/manga is highly debatable, to say the least. Nor is it something that we need to discuss for the purpose of defending anime watching, as long as we have evidence that anime *is* worth watching. As the Buddha remarked on someone asking after heaven & hell rather than how to obtain enlightenment:

> "It is as if a man had been wounded by a poisoned arrow, and his friends & relatives procured him a surgeon. But the man says, 'I will not have this arrow out until I learn whether my injurer were Brahmin or Kshatriya; tall, short, or medium; black, dusky, or of yellow skin; from this or that city; whether it be an ordinary or claw-headed arrow...' The man would die without learning all this."

But let's discuss it anyway. I have heard people say that the edge comes from American media's abandonment of the serial format in favor of a static episodic format that would [syndicate](!Wikipedia "Broadcast syndication") profitably, or from maintaining a diversity of genres ranging from moralistic child tales to comedy to business wars to detective stories while American comics slowly degenerated into ever more involuted superhero comics and American TV retrod the same action-adventure formulas. What follows is my subjective take, gleaned from my own idiosyncratic [anime watching](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/gwern), [book reading](docs/2002-notenki-memoirs), and SF reading habits. This seems plausible to me, anyway. Defending anime on esthetics grounds seems easy. American cartoons were, before the advent of anime, marked by an episodic format that destroyed any detailed overarching plot-line, and were not visually accomplished; further, they were highly stereotyped and commercial enterprises^[Japanese productions were quite commercial too, but the devil is in the details - _Gundam_ was designed to sell toys, but has become so much more than a model advertisement. In America, it would never have become more.].

American animation was ham-stringed to be both a single medium *and* a single genre (children's). In comparison, Japanese animation was a single medium that covered every genre that TV covered. One could grow up in Japanese animation, from _[Hamtaro](!Wikipedia)_ to challenging films like _[Mind Game](!Wikipedia "Mind Game (film)")_. One could not do this with American animation. (Director [Hideaki Anno](!Wikipedia) has [wondered](http://web.archive.org/web/20001215150600/www.acsys.com/~tallman/newtype_e.html) "if a person over the age of twenty who likes robot anime is really happy." The jury is still out for Japanese robot anime, but American animation has already pled guilty & been sentenced.)

Further, anime excelled in genres that American TV confined to ghettos. There are many fine fantasy and SF anime from the 1990s, but I find it painful to try to watch American products from the '90s like _[Hercules](!Wikipedia "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys")_ or _[Babylon 5](!Wikipedia)_. The obvious counter-examples like _[The Matrix](!Wikipedia)_ almost prove the point, the Wachowski brothers having been quite explicit about their debt to anime and sponsoring _[The Animatrix](!Wikipedia)_

Critically-acclaimed series like _[Samurai Jack](!Wikipedia)_ were a *reaction to* the demonstrated consumer demand for long-form series. (Truly episodic TV fictional shows seem to be ever rarer, and survivors from earlier eras, like _The Simpsons_, have grown more plot-oriented - in an earlier _Flintstones_ era, it would have been edgy to merely reference events from previous seasons and unthinkable to kill [Maude Flanders](!Wikipedia). It's interesting to speculate on why. I've heard many theories, from [DVR](!Wikipedia "Digital video recorder")s to premium cable channels like HBO to greater IQ^[See [Flynn effect](!Wikipedia) and _[Everything Bad Is Good for You](!Wikipedia)_.].)

What's interesting about anime is that if you look at American print SF & fantasy and whatnot, it's wildly creative and fascinating, but anything in moving pictures is either a critically successful failure or dreck. In Japan, the literature isn't so impressive (with honorable exceptions like [Haruki Murakami](!Wikipedia)), but the manga and anime are really good.  _[They Were Eleven](!Wikipedia)_ would be merely a mediocre short story if it were published in an American SF magazine, but instead, it's one of the better SF movies around (because all the American SF movies are so bad). Or consider _Star Trek_; while _Star Trek_ has been hugely popular in American SF circles almost to the point of synonymity, _Star Trek_ was merely fairly popular in syndication in Japan^[[Yasuhiro Takeda](!Wikipedia) could only describe Japanese _Star Trek_ fans as 'a large percentage' of all Japanese fans; an American would probably have had to say 'nearly all fans', especially before _Star Wars_ offered an alternative.]. American TV series offer another case in point: one of the best received SF series of the 2000s was _[Firefly](!Wikipedia "Firefly (TV series)")_ which has been thought to have been heavily influenced by the popular 1998 anime _[Cowboy Bebop](!Wikipedia)_.^[Consider [all the discussion](http://www.google.com/cse?cx=009114923999563836576%3A1eorkzz2gp4&q=Firefly+%22Cowboy+Bebop%22) of the two in my [CSE](http://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=009114923999563836576:1eorkzz2gp4).] None of the SF stories in either _Firefly_ or _Cowboy Bebop_ break new ground in SF, instead trading in classic SF stories and tropes; but they do so in a polished, stylish fashion.

From that perspective, it's not actually a surprise that if we look at the respective markets, we find that American print SF is very popular in Japan^[Hard-to-obtain sales figures aside, I believe this because I see all sorts of American SF references in anime which one might not expect. _The Notenki Memoirs_ mentions a number of Japanese SF authors who also translated English SF on the side, and [Gainax](!Wikipedia)'s work is littered with American references, from [Cordwainer Smith](!Wikipedia)'s [Instrumentality of Mankind](!Wikipedia) to _[Flowers for Algernon](!Wikipedia)_ to [Larry Niven](!Wikipedia)'s [Known Space](!Wikipedia) to [Harlan Ellison](!Wikipedia)'s ["The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World"](!Wikipedia "The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World (short story)").], and Japanese anime/manga is very popular over here. You might call this [comparative advantage](!Wikipedia) at work.

## Bonus points

The critic of anime probably consumes American pop culture himself, and has some argument for its entertainment value (let's call its value _AV_). Anime is Japanese pop culture so let's call its entertainment value _JV_. If the Japanese pop culture is merely as entertaining as American pop culture (as we have license to believe based on its inroads into America), then it can win on other grounds. It carries educational value sheerly from its origin (call educational value _JEV_). One will learn little from an American production by virtue of being an American. Obviously, if $AV=JV$ and $JEV>0$ then $JV+JEV>AV$ (just as $x+1>x$).

To defeat this, one needs to argue one of the following:

1) deny the second premise, and say that $JEV=0$

    This is saying that Japanese pop culture is not educational in any way. An obvious falsehood, since at the minimum one is learning about the Japanese way of life like not wearing shoes indoor
2) deny the first premise, and claim that $JV < AV$

    Say that Japanese pop culture's entertainment value is worse than American pop culture, hence $JV+EV$ is not *necessarily* greater than _AV_; this position is difficult to defend, given anime's commercial and critical successes. If anime is less entertaining than American pop culture, then why is it so popular? Are the fans systematically irrational?

    And if the critic reaches even further and tries to argue that anime is bad for you, they invite the obvious counter-question: 'And why do you think American pop culture is not equally or even more toxic for one's mind?'
3) Deny all premises and say that pop culture in general is valueless, that all values = 0

    Obviously $0 > 0$ is a contradiction, and the argument collapses. But this position exposes the arguer to charges of hypocrisy, since why does he consume pop culture if all pop culture is worthless, and on what ground could he criticize anime at all? Most arguers are trying to establish a ranking in disfavor of anime, not simply say 'a pox on both your houses'.

We could re-run this argument with 'novel' rather than 'educational'. We have no prior reason to suppose Japanese pop culture any less innovative than American pop culture, but to an American, the Japanese media will be highly novel. Even a boring Hindu fable could be interesting if it's the first one you've ever seen. (This is a general purpose argument for preferring foreign media or literature. To some, this would be a _reductio_, but to others it will make perfect sense. Why read about things you are *already* familiar with?)

# Pearls before swine

Most people wouldn't appreciate these 2 arguments, so I don't usually try to justify watching anime, and just say _[de gustibus non est disputandum](!Wikipedia)_^[This is a cop-out on my part. Like many arguments from [revealed preference](!Wikipedia)s, that is a [fully general counterargument](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Fully_general_counterargument) which can be used to justify any choice.]. (If someone wants to discuss philosophy, though, that's fine. "When you meet a swordsman, show him your sword / do not offer a poem to any but a poet.")
