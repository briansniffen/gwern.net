> How do you justify anime/manga as a hobby? I catch a lot of flak and because of that tend to hide my hobby from others.

One might initially wonder why one would think about what is a 'better' hobby or media to consume. Maybe it is something you just shouldn't argue about, like whether chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla. But it is sensible to think about. There's no hard-and-fast distinction between a hobby and a job (knitting _[Katamari Damacy](!Wikipedia)_ hats), or a career (Facebook wasn't incorporated from the get-go), or simple consumption (is 'TV watching' a 'hobby'?), or charity (building houses with Habitat for Humanity), or morality ([learning modern theology](http://commonsenseatheism.com/), discussing issues in utilitarianism). 'Hobby' is not a [natural kind](!Wikipedia). No one would question whether you should try to compare jobs, or compare ethical philosophies, or even consumption ('you should buy [fair trade](!Wikipedia) chocolate instead!'). Which of these issues is more important will depend on specifics, of course; the tea connoisseur is more affected by economic & social justice issues, while the job-hunter may worry more about corporate ethics, and the TV watcher may be interested in recommendation algorithms to optimize enjoyability per hour (since there is more to watch than one could [see in a life](Culture is not about esthetics)) or [issues](http://33bits.org/2010/03/15/open-letter-to-netflix/) [of privacy](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html). But there *are* issues to think about.

# A real problem

The question is, not surprisingly, often posed about anime. How to defend watching anime? It's interesting that anime is this popular; you don't hear people asking how to defend their love of [Korean wave](!Wikipedia) movies and soap opera. It wasn't always this way - back in the 1970s, anime was so rare as to not be worth discussing, and even in the 1980s it was a phenomenon limited largely to college campuses where homemade VHS [fansubs](!Wikipedia) could be aired for select enthusiasts.^[I read in the archived files of one BBS that sometimes when fansubs were unavailable, anime clubs might watch an episode anyway. Even when no one there knew Japanese.] It seems to be a fact that anime *is* overrepresented in the American market compared to moving picture products of other countries. How many British productions does one see in America, despite England being one of the closest culture to America, despite all their productions being in English by default, despite 70 years of television excellence by the BBC, etc. etc.? Not very many. Or how about [Bollywood](!Wikipedia), one of the most prolific cinemas in the world, active since the 1930s? Or the aforementioned [Korean films](!Wikipedia "Cinema of Korea")? (That the American remake of the critically acclaimed & commercially successful _[Oldboy](!Wikipedia)_ fell through, and the DVD release obscure, only emphasizes the point.)

# Exogenous factors

Of course, perhaps the failure of all non-Japanese sources is due to some market defect. Hollywood is infamous for its accounting standards, less than transparent dealings, and backroom agreements; reasonable to suggest that the game is rigged against foreign entrants. Or maybe the market is just plain oversaturated - too many would-be cooks.  But why would either of these not have kept anime/manga at 1970/1980 levels? What exempts them? Or perhaps the Japanese are somehow _simpatico_ with Americans and can specially appeal to the American psyche; but then, why aren't British works cleaning up (surely the British are even closer culturally), and why are [French](!Wikipedia "Manga outside Japan#France") manga sales (with 1/6 the population) even stronger than American sales? I know of no explanation, so in the absence of convincing evidence, we should work on the assumption that the content of anime/manga is responsible for its competitive success.

# Bonus points

Here's one approach I could take. I might justify it as following: my interlocutor probably consumes American pop culture and has an argument for its value (let's call its value AV); anime is Japanese pop culture (call its value JV); even if it is merely only as good as American pop culture, it carries educational value sheerly from its origin (call educational value EV). Obviously, if AV=JV, then JV+EV>AV (just as x+1>x).

Any arguer must prove that Japanese pop culture is either:

1) not educational in any way, that EV=0; an obvious falsehood, since at the minimum one is learning about the Japanese way of life like shoes indoor
2) that it is worse than American pop culture, that JV < AV, so JV+EV is not necessarily greater than AV; this position is a hard to argue one, given anime's commercial and critical successes
3) or that pop culture in general is valueless, that all values = 0, since obviously 0 > 0 is false; this position exposes the arguer to charges of hypocrisy, since why does he consume pop culture at all if it all is worthless, much less prefers American pop culture?

We could also re-run this argument with 'novel' rather than 'educational'. We have no prior reason to suppose Japanese pop culture any less innovative than American pop culture, but to an American, the Japanese will be highly novel. Even a boring Hindu fable could be interesting if it's the first one you've ever seen.

Most people wouldn't appreciate this reasoning, so I don't justify it at all usually, and just say _[de gustibus non est disputandum](!Wikipedia)_. (If someone wants to discuss philosophy, though, that's fine. "When you meet a swordsman, show him your sword / do not offer a poem to any but a poet.")

> So basically, you believe that for one to argue that J-pop culture is detrimental to one's intellect is an obvious falsehood?

Well, it's either false, or it's trivially used against them. 'And why do you think American pop culture is not equally or even more toxic for one's mind?' So no intelligent person would try to take that route.

# Peculiar quality

*What* precisely is good about anime/manga is highly debatable, to say the least. Nor is it something that we need to discuss for the purpose of defending anime watching, as long as we have evidence that anime *is* worth watching. As the Buddha remarked on someone asking after heaven & hell rather than how to obtain enlightenment:

> "It is as if a man had been wounded by a poisoned arrow, and his friends & relatives procured him a surgeon. But the man says, 'I will not have this arrow out until I learn whether my injurer were Brahmin or Kshatriya; tall, short, or medium; black, dusky, or of yellow skin; from this or that city; whether it be an ordinary or claw-headed arrow...' The man would die without learning all this."

But let's discuss it anyway. I have heard people say that the edge comes from American media's abandonment of the serial format in favor of a static episodic format that would [syndicate](!Wikipedia "Broadcast syndication") profitably, or from maintaining a diversity of genres ranging from moralistic child tales to comedy to business wars to detective stories while American comics slowly degenerated into ever more involuted superhero comics and American TV retrod the same action-adventure formulas. What follows is my subjective take, gleaned from my own idiosyncratic [anime watching](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/gwern), [book reading](docs/2002-notenki-memoirs), and SF reading habits.

What's interesting about anime is that if you look at American print SF & fantasy and whatnot, it's wildly creative and fascinating, but anything in moving pictures is either a critically successful failure or dreck. In Japan, the literature isn't so impressive (with honorable exceptions like [Haruki Murakami](!Wikipedia)), but the manga and anime are really good.  _[They Were Eleven](!Wikipedia)_ would be merely a mediocre short story if it were published in an American SF magazine, but instead, it's one of the better SF movies around (because all the American SF movies are so bad). Or consider _Star Trek_; while _Star Trek_ has been hugely popular in American SF circles almost to the point of synonymity, _Star Trek_ was merely fairly popular in syndication in Japan^[[Yasuhiro Takeda](!Wikipedia) could only describe Japanese _Star Trek_ fans as 'a large percentage' of all Japanese fans; an American would probably have had to say 'nearly all fans', especially before _Star Wars_ offered an alternative.]. American TV series offer another case in point: one of the best received SF series of the 2000s was _[Firefly](!Wikipedia "Firefly (TV series)")_ which has been thought to have been heavily influenced by the popular 1998 anime _[Cowboy Bebop](!Wikipedia)_.^[Consider [all the discussion](http://www.google.com/cse?cx=009114923999563836576%3A1eorkzz2gp4&q=Firefly+%22Cowboy+Bebop%22) of the two in my [CSE](http://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=009114923999563836576:1eorkzz2gp4).] None of the SF stories in either _Firefly_ or _Cowboy Bebop_ break new ground in SF, instead trading in classic SF stories and tropes; but they do so in a polished, stylish fashion.

From that perspective, it's not actually a surprise that if we look at the respective markets, we find that American print SF is very popular in Japan^[Hard-to-obtain sales figures aside, I believe this because I see all sorts of American SF references in anime which one might not expect. _The Notenki Memoirs_ mentions a number of Japanese SF authors who also translated English SF on the side, and [Gainax](!Wikipedia)'s work is littered with American references, from [Cordwainer Smith](!Wikipedia)'s [Instrumentality of Mankind](!Wikipedia) to _[Flowers for Algernon](!Wikipedia)_ to [Larry Niven](!Wikipedia)'s [Known Space](!Wikipedia) to [Harlan Ellison](!Wikipedia)'s ["The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World"](!Wikipedia "The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World (short story)").], and Japanese anime/manga is very popular over here. You might call this [comparative advantage](!Wikipedia) at work.
