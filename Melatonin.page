# Case study: Melatonin

One of the problems with 'productivity' devices and methods is assessing their worth.

Many of them claim unmeasurable gains^[[mindmaps](!Wikipedia "Mind map")], dubious gains^['image-streaming'], or clear gains which mayn't be worth the overhead^[schedulers, [personal organizers](!Wikipedia), _[Getting Things Done](!Wikipedia)_].

The benefits of others are perfectly measurable, like adding [keybindings](!Wikipedia) for repetitive tasks; just time the manual way versus the shortcut, and multiply it by the usage. But then the cost is hard to measure. How to assess the price of creating, learning, and rendering habitual a custom shortcut? There are scads of useful bindings in [Emacs](!Wikipedia) that I have tried to learn, only to forget them or remember them after I needed them.

My favorite 'productivity tool' is one that suffers from none of these problems, and has refreshingly clear-cut costs and benefits. Even though it eats up a third to a half of your life, sleep is neglected because people assume it is too hard to quantify or is too mysterious; but since it takes such a large chunk of time, even doubtful or unreliable improvements are well worth your while.

## Use

[Melatonin](!Wikipedia) is a [hormone](!Wikipedia) secreted by the [pineal gland](!Wikipedia). Its primary purpose is regulating the sleep cycle; its abatement permits waking. Odds are your local greengrocer carries it. It's often used by people suffering from insomnia or to combat conditions such as [jet lag](!Wikipedia).^[For which it has an impeccable scientific track record; eg [Cardinali 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12019344).]

But it's also useful for people with perfectly normal sleep-cycles. I am unsure whether its effect is to put one to sleep faster, or to do that and also deepen sleep, but melatonin does it well. My rule of thumb is melatonin subtracts an hour. That is: if one slept for 7 hours, one awakes as refreshed as if one had slept for 8 hours (and so on). There are few to no side-effects to melatonin use, and it is not addictive or habit-forming like caffeine is. The usual dose for a night is 1-3 mg; I take 1.5mg[^od].

Melatonin is apparently [safe](!Wikipedia "Melatonin#Side effects"); from a [meta-analysis](!Wikipedia) of melatonin studies:

> "The most commonly reported adverse effects of melatonin were nausea (incidence: ~ 1.5 percent), headache (incidence: ~ 7.8 percent), dizziness (incidence: 4.0 percent), and drowsiness (incidence: 20.33 percent); however, these effects were not significant compared to placebo. This result did not change by dose, the presence or absence of a sleep disorder, type of sleep disorder, duration of treatment, gender, age, formulation of melatonin, use of concurrent medication, study design, quality score, and allocation concealment score."^[["Melatonin for Treatment of Sleep Disorders: Summary"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11941/); this meta-analysis also suggests that melatonin works on some metrics, but has little or no effect on other measurements, which is a contrast to my own generally sanguine belief.]

Indeed, there's an argument to be made that the health of heavy computer-users (such as myself and I dare say most of my readers) will *improve* through melatonin supplementation.

Ordinary room lighting at night, before bedtime, has been shown to cut melatonin secretion in half.[^light] Blue light is the [main culprit](!Wikipedia "Melatonin#Light dependence"); there are counter-measures to reduce one's exposure to blue light like [light-filtering glasses](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/8/prweb422077.htm) or programs such as [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/)/[f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) which lower the [color temperature](!Wikipedia) (reducing the blueness) of one's monitor. They are a good idea^[Fellow programmers: you would particularly benefit from using Redshift/F.lux. If you don't believe me, read [some](http://blog.wakemate.com/2011/03/21/using-electronics-before-bed-is-detrimental-but-f-lux-might-have-the-solution/) [testimonials](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2369788).]. But they aren't perfect solutions and only reduce the damage; and if [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia) is [right that](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/01/the-future-is-bright.html) future bright [LED lights](!Wikipedia) will be cheaper and more popular, we can expect that much more problems with melatonin deficiency. And what are those problems?

[Shift workers](!Wikipedia) have been linked to a great many health problems (such as [various](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/40170/title/Darkness%2C_melatonin_may_stall_breast_and_prostate_cancers) [cancers](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/20/070820fa_fact_owen?currentPage=all) or [mental delays](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Research/Lower-melatonin-levels-may-affect-infant-mental-capacity-study); see [shift work sleep disorder](!Wikipedia)), and the proposed causal mechanism is usually a melatonin deficiency (and melatonin supplementation one of the [treatments](!Wikipedia "Shift work sleep disorder#Melatonin treatment")). (They have also been linked to many accidents and [near-accidents](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TRAVEL/03/24/dc.air.traffic.suspension/index.html).) 

[^light]: See ["Light Exposure May Cut Production of Melatonin: Study Shows Artificial Light Before Bedtime May Affect Quality of Sleep"](http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20110119/light-exposure-may-cut-production-of-melatonin), _WebMD_; ["Melatonin production falls if the lights are on"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12181853), _BBC News_; and an older study, ["The dark side of light at night: physiological, epidemiological, and ecological consequences"](http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/nelson/documents/JPinealRes2007.pdf). More recently, the [National Sleep Foundation](!Wikipedia) released its [2011 survey](http://www.cnbc.com/id/41943401) finding ever more electronics use before bed; relevant quote:

    > "Artificial light exposure between dusk and the time we go to bed at night suppresses release of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, enhances alertness and shifts circadian rhythms to a later hour--making it more difficult to fall asleep," says Charles Czeisler, Ph.D., MD, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. "This study reveals that light-emitting screens are in heavy use within the pivotal hour before sleep. Invasion of such alerting technologies into the bedroom may contribute to the high proportion of respondents who reported that they routinely get less sleep than they need." Computer or laptop use is also common. Roughly six in ten (61%) say they use their laptops or computers at least a few nights a week within the hour before bed. More than half of generation Z'ers (55%) and slightly less of generation Y'ers (47%) say they surf the Internet every night or almost every night within the hour before sleep."

## Benefits
### _Tempus Fugit_

So that's what it does: it lets one cut 1 hour of sleep. (There are other benefits, such as enforcing a bedtime - invaluable for young people - but their values are indeterminate.)

Let's work out the cost of regularly using melatonin. Conservatively, a bottle of melatonin pills will cost about 6 USD for 150 pills. Per milligram, the 3 mg pills are the least costly, and are easily convertible into lower dosages. Regardless, one will get a minimum of 150 doses per $6. $\frac{600}{150}$ = 4¢ per pill. 1 night requires 1 dose, so each night costs 4¢.  We need to consider much we value the effort of remembering and taking the pill, though. Let us be conservative and price it as high as 10¢. So we spend 14¢ per night[^price]. The reward is that we gain an hour.

Now how do we value an hour of our time? One could make an intuitive guess, or consider one's current salary and things like that, but in economics 101, it's common to just set the value of an hour at [minimum wage](!Wikipedia). This will hopefully not be *too* erroneous, since over our lifetime, the days where that extra hour was really valuable will balance out the days where the hour was worthless.

More concretely, the minimum wage is the floor for one's [opportunity cost](!Wikipedia); even if the hour's opportunity you forgo by sleeping more wasn't worth a million dollars, you could still have worked a unskilled minimum wage job and gotten the minimum wage.

The federal minimum wage as of 2008 is $6.55 an hour[^conservative]. So let's say that is the reward.

### ROI

In other words, by investing 14¢, we realize a net of 655¢, for a profit of 641¢. This represents a return on our investment of approximately 4678% ($\frac{655}{14} \times 100$).

Suppose we use only half a pill a night? Then our number of doses doubles, our pill price per night halves (though our 10¢ of effort remains constant), and our return becomes 5458% ($\frac{655}{12} \times 100$).

My local store sometimes runs a 2-for-1 sale on melatonin. One could buy only at these sales - the low consumption rate (1 a night, or less) means you must buy less than annually. Thus, the pill price halves again to 1¢ per night, and now the return is 5959% ($\frac{655}{11} \times 100$).

### Absolute gains

Let's look at another perspective. Those are impressive percentages, but they're on a low base so perhaps it's not worthwhile even with 6000% returns. What are the absolute gains one would realize over the course of a year? Well, to calculate: ($(365 \times 6.55) - (365 \times 0.11)$), or to simplify: ($365 \times (6.55 - 0.11)$) = $2350.60. We would have to assume our calculations are 3 or 4 orders of magnitude before melatonin stops being a good deal.

One year of melatonin amply repays the original costs of learning about and experimenting with it. (And the long-run benefits are substantial.[^future])

## Self-discipline

Speaking from personal experience, I know that one of the obstacles to sleeping well is going to sleep at all. Even though one knows that one ought to go to bed on time, and that not doing so will cause problems, it's hard to actually do it, One wants to finish the book, chat with friends, play a game, etc. It is even more difficult when one doesn't feel tired.

This dilemma is far from unique. It is called [hyperbolic discounting](!Wikipedia); humans can make the rational decision when at a great distance from a choice, but the closer they come, the more warped their decisions are. Procrastination is often thanks to hyperbolic discounting - 'hard work pays off tomorrow but procrastination pays off now', and never mind that tomorrow always comes. Similarly, addicts want to be free of their addiction, but their want for a drink _right now_ overwhelms their lifetime desire to not have drinks. (For more on the topic, see ["Akrasia, hyperbolic discounting, and picoeconomics"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/6c/picoeconomics/) and ["Applied Picoeconomics"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ep/applied_picoeconomics/).)

How do we deal with this? The classic mechanism is avoiding the choice entirely. An addict can avoid bars or liquor stores, but no one can avoid sleep. Failing to avoid the choice entirely, one raises the cost of 'procrastination' - make the addict pay $100 for every drink they take. Even apparently trivial cost increases like [someone watching our computer desktop](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2qv/antiakrasia_remote_monitoring_experiment/) through [VNC](!Wikipedia "Virtual Network Computing"), or working at a coffee shop[^coffee] can make a real difference with procrastination. We need to raise the cost, then, and somehow change the incentives to make us want to sleep.

[^coffee]: Many people [swear](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/working-best-at-coffee-shops/237372/) [by](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2462683) working in public places like libraries or cafes. Neeti Gupta remarks in ["Grande Wi-Fi: Understanding What Wi-Fi Users Are Doing in Coffee-Shops"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.95.3101&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (2004) that:

    > "...when we are alone in a public place, we have a fear of "having no purpose". If we are in a public place and it looks like that we have no business there, it may not seem socially appropriate. In coffee-shops it is okay to be there to drink coffee but loitering is definitely not allowed by coffee-shop owners, so coffee-shops patrons deploy different methods to look "busy". Being disengaged is our big social fear, especially in public spaces, and people try to cover their "being there" with an acceptable visible activity."

We *can* do this simply by waiting until the need to sleep is so strong we can no longer resist; and in practice, many (especially college students) do just this. But few of us have the luxury of the bizarre schedule this entails. We could try some sort of monetary fine for not going to bed by midnight, but enforcement is difficult and if you're a college student, you may not be able to afford a vow painful enough to deter you.

Melatonin allows us a different way of raising the cost, a _physiological_ & self-enforcing way. Half an hour before we plan to go to sleep, we take a pill. The procrastinating effect will not work - half an hour is so far away that our decision-making process & willpower are undistorted and can make the right decision (viz. following the schedule). When the half-hour is up, the melatonin has begun to make us sleepy. Staying awake ceases to be free, to be the default option; now it is costly to fight the melatonin and remain awake. The choice of sleep may now prevail over the hyperbolically-distorted choice of video games.

And going to sleep when you need to go to sleep is, in the long-run, a very valuable thing in its own right.

## Excuses, excuses...

Melatonin is a clear-cut Good Thing. The gains I have laid out are significant enough I consider it irrational for someone not to use it, unless:

1) You've never heard of it, or seen an analysis of the possible benefits.
     - You, dear reader, are no longer allowed this excuse.
2) You are *so* poor that 6 dollars every 150 or 300 days is a crippling expense.
     - But then how come you to have the free time to read this?
3) Melatonin supplements just doesn't work on you, period.
     - Possible, but it's not common. Melatonin isn't some mental trick - it's a fundamental fact of mammalian biology. I've run into more people who have tried melatonin and had it help than who found it completely ineffective.
4) They work, but not well enough.
     - This implies that melatonin save you only a few minutes or seconds, else the gain would be smaller but still be positive. (This too strikes me as unlikely.)
4) You value a simpler, less complicated life *that* much.
     - Taking a pill at night, and buying some pills once every year or two stresses you out?
5) You value an hour at less than 11¢, so melatonin is not profitable.
     - Please contact me. I would like to hire you at the princely rate of a dime an hour to do drudge-work on Wikipedia.

## Competition

A parting thought: millions of Americans regularly take [multivitamin](!Wikipedia) supplements. These supplements are unlikely to help a balanced diet, there is little evidence they do, and there are studies which have indicated actual harm from the consumption of multivitamins[^vitamins]. Multivitamins are noticeably more expensive than melatonin pills, and are certainly harder to swallow. And this is to say nothing of supplements which are actually dangerous, like [kava](!Wikipedia) or [ephedra](!Wikipedia). Do you take a multivitamin, but not melatonin? If so, how can you justify this?

[^conservative]: Here's another place I am being overly conservative to guard against optimism on my part; the minimum wage was boosted to $7.25 in 2009, which obviously makes the gained hour that much more valuable and consequently all the figures will favor melatonin that much more.
[^vitamins]: See the multiple large studies cited in ["Vitamin Pills: A False Hope?"](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/health/17well.html); note that at least 3 studies showed increased disease & mortality rates associated with multivitamin usage, and [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Multivitamin#Evidence against") mentions a few downbeat reports & commissions.

    Interestingly, [antioxidants](!Wikipedia "Antioxidant#Adverse effects") have their [own](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/supplements-kill.html) [problems](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/magazine/16epidemiology-t.html?pagewanted=2) with [cancer](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/worries-about-antioxidant-use-by-breast-cancer-patients/#more-6629) and [destroying](!Wikipedia "Antioxidant#Physical exercise") [benefits](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/phys-ed-free-the-free-radicals/) [from](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/health/research/12exer.html) [exercise](http://www.exrx.net/Nutrition/Antioxidants/Antioxidants.html).

    Of course, such contrarianism receives its own critics; [Phil Goetz](http://lesswrong.com/lw/20i/even_if_you_have_a_nail_not_all_hammers_are_the/) says that 3 of the major anti-vitamin studies have fatal statistical flaws.
[^od]: If one overdoses and takes, say, 9 mg, the effect is that one will sleep for 10-12 hours, and as I can attest, then awake with a nasty headache that lasts for the rest of that day. You'll notice that one doesn't sleep 3 or 6 times the normal amount; this suggests that melatonin quickly loses effectiveness and soon becomes counterproductive; [Wikipedia summarizes](!Wikipedia "Melatonin#Use as a dietary supplement"):

    > "Large doses of melatonin can even be counterproductive: Lewy et al[68] provide support to the "idea that too much melatonin may spill over onto the wrong zone of the melatonin phase-response curve" (PRC). In one of their subjects, 0.5 mg of melatonin was effective while 20 mg was not."
[^price]: I say very pessimistic because my actual price is ~1.4¢ per night. Tommy Health recently sold 120 3mg pills for $2.49; I bought 6, with shipping, at $20.89. Remembering that I take half a pill, the price per night is $\frac{\frac{2000}{6 \times 120}}{2}$, or, 1.38¢
[^future]: Applying the usual 'present value of a future sum' formula, which goes $present = \frac{future}{(1-discount)^n}$, we find that 60 years from now, the $2000 is worth $92: $2000 \times (1-0.05)^60 = 92.1$. We can be pessimistic and value the annual return at $200, and sum the 60 years in Haskell with `sum (map (\x -> 200 * (1-0.05)^x) [0..60])`, or $38245.a
