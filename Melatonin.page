> Case study: Melatonin

One of the problems with 'productivity' devices and methods is assessing their worth. Many of them claim unmeasurable gains, like mindmaps, or perhaps they do offer gains but it is unclear they are worth the hassle, like personal organizers and schedulers. The benefits of others are perfectly measurable, like adding keybindings for repetitive tasks (time the manual way versus the shortcut, and multiply it by the usage), but then the cost is hard to measure. How to assess the price of learning and rendering habitual a custom keyboard shortcut? There are many useful default bindings in Emacs alone that I have tried to learn, only to forget them or remember them too late when I have need of them. Unsurprisingly, my favorite 'productivity tool' is one that suffers from none of these problems, and has refreshingly clear-cut costs and benefits.

## Use

Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland. Its primary purpose is regulating the sleep cycle; its abatement permits waking. It's available over the counter just about everywhere. Odds are your local greengrocer's or pharmacy carries it. It's often used by people suffering from insomnia or to combat conditions such as jet lag.

But it's also useful for people with perfectly normal sleep-cycles. I am unsure whether its effect is to put one to sleep faster, or to do that and also deepen sleep, but whatever it does, it does well. It has been my rule of thumb over the past several years that the net effect of taking melatonin before bed is that one effectively gains an hour. That is: if one slept for 7 hours, one awakes as refreshed as if one had slept for 8 hours (and so on). There are no side-effects to melatonin use, and it is not addictive or habit-forming. The usual dose for a night is 1-3 mg; I take 1.5. If one overdoses and takes, say, 9 mg, the effect is that one will sleep for 10-12 hours, and as I can attest, then awake with a nasty headache that lasts for the rest of that day.

## Benefits
### _Tempus Fugit_

So that's what it does: it lets one cut 1 hour of sleep. (There are other benefits, such as enforcing a bedtime - invaluable for young people - but their values are indeterminate.) Let's work out the cost of regularly using melatonin. A bottle of melatonin pills will cost about 6 USD for 150 pills. Per milligram, the 3 mg pills are the least costly, and are convertible into lower dosages. Regardless, one will get a minimum of 150 doses per 6 USD. 600/150 = 4 cents per pill. 1 night requires 1 dose, so each night costs 4 cents.  We need to consider much we value the effort of remembering and taking the pill, though. Let us be conservative and price it as high as 10 cents. So the total comes to 14 cents a night. The reward is that we gain an hour. 

Now how do we value an hour of our time? One could make an intuitive guess, or consider one's current salary and things like that, but it's common to just set the value of an hour at minimum wage. This will hopefully not be *too* erroneous, since high-wage hours will balance out no-wage or worthless hours. More concretely, the minimum wage is the floor for one's [opportunity cost](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Opportunity_cost); even if the hour's opportunity you forgo by sleeping more is not an opportunity that will make you a billion dollars, you could still have worked a unskilled minimum wage job and been guaranteed the minimum wage.

The current federal minimum wage as of 2008 is 6.55 USD an hour. So let's say that is the reward.

### ROI

In other words, by investing 14 cents, we realize a net of 655 cents, or a profit of 641 cents. This represents a return on our investment of approximately ~4678% ((655 / 14) * 100). A worthwhile investment in my opinion.

Suppose we use only half a pill a night? Then our number of nights doubles, our pill price per night halves (though our 10 cents of effort remains constant), and our return becomes ~5458% ((655 / 12) * 100).

My local store sometimes runs a 2-for-1 sale on melatonin. I only buy at these sales. I can afford to wait, as the low consumption rate (1 a night, or less) means I buy roughly once a year. Thus, the pill price halves again to 1 cent per night, and now our return is ~5959% ((655 / 11) * 100).

### Absolute gains

Let's look at another perspective. Those are impressive percentages, but they're on a low base so perhaps it's not worthwhile even with 6000% returns. What are the absolute gains one would realize over the course of a year? Well, to calculate: ((365 * 6.55) - (365 * 0.11)), or to simplify: (365 * (6.55 - 0.11)) = 2350.60 USD.

I consider an annual gain of over 2000 dollars worth of my time to have been well-worth the original costs of learning about and experimenting with melatonin.

## Excuses, excuses...

Melatonin is a clear-cut Good Thing. The gains I have laid out are significant enough I consider it irrational for someone not to use it, unless:

1) You've never heard of it, or seen an analysis of the possible benefits. (You, dear reader, are no longer allowed this excuse.)
2) You are so poor that 6 dollars every 150 or 300 days is a crippling expense. (But then how come you to have the free time to read this?)
3) Melatonin supplements just doesn't work on you, period. (Possible, but unlikely.)
4) They work, but not enough. (This implies that melatonin save you only a few minutes. This too strikes me as unlikely.)
4) You value a simpler, less complicated life *that* much. (Taking a pill at night, and buying some pills every half a year stresses you out that much?)
5) You value an hour at less than 11 cents, so melatonin is not profitable. (Please contact me. I would like to hire you at the princely rate of a dime an hour to do drudge-work on Wikipedia.)

## Competition

A parting thought: millions of Americans regularly take multivitamin supplements. These supplements are unlikely to help a balanced diet, there is little evidence they do, and there are studies which have indicated actual harm from the consumption of multivitamins[^vitamins]. Multivitamins are noticeably more expensive than melatonin pills, and are certainly harder to swallow. And this is to say nothing of supplements which are actually dangerous, like kava or ephedra. Do you take a multivitamin, but not melatonin? If so, how can you justify this?

[^vitamins]: See the multiple large studies cited in ["Vitamin Pills: A False Hope?"(http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/health/17well.html); note that at least 3 studies showed increased disease & mortality rates associated with multivitamin usage.
