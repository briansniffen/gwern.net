description: Bostrom's evolutionary heuristics & how they apply to nootropics
...

People discussion human-enhancement (especially [transhumanists](!Wikipedia)) have long recognized a pessimistic observation, sometimes dubbed "Algernon's law" or the "Algernon principle".

# Algernon's law

The famous story _[Flowers for Algernon](!Wikipedia)_ postulates surgery which triples the IQ score of the retarded protagonist - but which comes with the devastating side-effects of the gain being both temporary and sometimes fatal. [Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia) expands the thought out in his essay ["Algernon's Law"](http://web.archive.org/web/200102021712/http://sysopmind.com/algernon.html), stating it as:

> "Any simple major enhancement to human intelligence is a net evolutionary disadvantage."

The lesson is that Mother Nature know best. Or alternately, [TANSTAAFL](!Wikipedia): "there ain't no such thing as a [free lunch](!Wikipedia)". Often, if you use a drug or surgery to optimize something, you will discover penalties elsewhere. If you try to stop aging, you might find that you have just encouraged cancer; or if you try to enhance attention with an amphetamine, you destroy creativity, or if the amphetamines reduce sleep, you damage memory consolidation or peripheral awareness[^sleep]; or improving memory also increases sensitivity to pain[^doogie] and so on. "Hardly any man is clever enough to know all the evil he does."^[[François de La Rochefoucauld](!Wikipedia), _Maximes_ 269]

[^sleep]: [Nick Bostrom](!Wikipedia) & [Anders Sandberg](!Wikipedia)'s ["Converging Cognitive Enhancements"](http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/converging.pdf) (2006):

    > Keeping awake using stimulants prevents the memory consolidation that would have taken place during sleep, and enhanced concentration ability may impair the ability to notice things in peripheral awareness.
[^doogie]: Bostrom/Sandberg 2006:

    > "Genetic memory enhancement has been demonstrated in rats and mice. In normal animals, during maturation expression of the NR2B subunit of the [N-methyl-D-aspartate](!Wikipedia "NMDA receptor") (NMDA) receptor is gradually replaced with expression of the NR2A subunit, something that may be linked to the lower brain plasticity in adult animals. Tsien's group (Tang et al. 1999) modified mice to overexpress the NR2B. The NR2B ['Doogie'](!Wikipedia "Doogie mice") mice demonstrated improved memory performance, both in terms of acquisition and retention. This included unlearning of fear conditioning, which is believed to be due to the learning of a secondary memory (Falls et al. 1992). The modification also made the mice more sensitive to certain forms of pain, suggesting a nontrivial trade-off between two potential enhancement goals (Wei et al. 2001)."

## EOC

In ["The Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement"](http://www.nickbostrom.com/evolution.pdf), [Nick Bostrom](!Wikipedia) puts this principle as:

> If the proposed intervention would result in an enhancement, why have we not already evolved to be that way?

Obviously we humans do intervene all the time, and many of those interventions are worthwhile. Women, for example, are big fans of [birth control](!Wikipedia "Combined oral contraceptive pill"), and if the female reproductive system isn't controlled by evolution, nothing is.

### Loopholes

There may be no free lunches, but might there be some cheap lunches? Yudkowsky's formulation points out several ways to escape the law:

1. interventions may not be *simple*

    So one might find major enhancements through some very complex surgery or prosthetic; perhaps brain implants which expand memory or enable (controlled) [wireheading](!Wikipedia)
2. the simple interventions may not lead to a *major* enhancement

    Nutritional supplements are examples; it makes perfect sense that fixing a chemical deficiency could be a simple matter and enhance fitness - but one would expect minor mental enhancements and this effect would not generalize to very many people. (Similarly, most nootropics do not do very much.)
3. the intervention may be simple, give major enhancements, but result in a *net* loss of fitness

    The famous [Ashkenazi theory of intelligence](!Wikipedia "Ashkenazi intelligence") comes to mind. According to this theory, the Ashkenazi were forced into occupations demanding intelligence, and micro-selected for high IQ. Except the high IQ genes were not previously prevalent among either Jews or gentiles because - like [sickle-cell anemia](!Wikipedia) -s when they became too prevalent, they result in horrible diseases like [Tay-Sachs](!Wikipedia).

Bostrom also offers 3 categories of ways in which interventions can escape his 'EOC':

1. "*Changed tradeoffs*. Evolution 'designed' the system for operation in one type of environment, but now we wish to deploy it in a very different type of environment. It is not surprising, then, that we might be able to modify the system better to meet the demands imposed on it by the new environment."
2. "*Value discordance*. There is a discrepancy between the standards by which evolution measured the quality of her work, and the standards that we wish to apply. Even if evolution had managed to build the finest reproduction-and-survival machine imaginable, we may still have reason to change it because what we value is not primarily to be maximally effective inclusive-fitness optimizers.
3. "*Evolutionary restrictions*. We have access to various tools, materials, and techniques that were unavailable to evolution. Even if our engineering talent is far inferior to evolution’s, we may nevertheless be able to achieve certain things that stumped evolution, thanks to these novel aids."

### Examples

Bostrom's criteria are more general, so we'll use them. Birth control is a clear example of satisfying loophole #2, 'value discordance'. Many women do not value having a dozen children while young; they would rather have just 2 at a time of their choosing. Pacemakers are an example of #3: evolution couldn't afford to engineer more reliable hearts, in part for lack of electronic microchips. Many traits related to nutrition fall into the category of #1.^[["Adaptive no more: A potential benefit in prehistoric lean times, genetic variant may increase risk of gestational diabetes today"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/69610/title/Adaptive_no_more), or see the [thrifty gene hypothesis](!Wikipedia).]

How about supplements? Most supplements are just tweaking biochemical processes, and don't obviously fall under 1, 2, or 3. [Melatonin](!Wikipedia), for example, may seem particularly questionable as one's body secrets considerable quantities in an intricate cycle.

#### Piracetam

Or in ["Growing up is hard"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xd/growing_up_is_hard/), [Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia) remarks that Bostrom's EOC is:

> "...one reason to be wary of, say, [cholinergic](!Wikipedia) memory enhancers [such as [piracetam](!Wikipedia)]: if they have no downsides, why doesn't the brain produce more [acetylcholine](!Wikipedia) already?  Maybe you're using up a limited memory capacity, or forgetting something else..."

Let's consider the specific case of piracetam. Piracetam is so old and has so many studies on its efficacy (real if not substantial) and safety (utterly) that it screens off a lot of secondary considerations.

- Might piracetam escape the EOC with #3?
- No. Whatever receptors or buttons piracetam pushes could already be pushed by the brain the usual way. There is nothing novel about piracetam in that sense.

- Might piracetam escape the EOC with #2?
- Perhaps. Hard to see how piracetam trades off reproductive fitness for something else, though. It's safe, unlike other substances such as tobacco.

- Might piracetam escape the EOC with #1?
- Probably. Many tradeoffs are different in contemporary First World countries than from the proverbial Stone Age veldt.

A 'cholinergic' operates by encouraging higher levels of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter; acetylcholine is one of the most common neurotransmitters. If serotonin is loosely associated with mood, we might say that acetylcholine is loosely associated with the 'velocity' of thoughts in the brain. If one is using more acetylcholine, one needs to create more acetylcholine (the brain cannot borrow indefinitely like the US federal government). Acetylcholine is made out of the [essential nutrient](!Wikipedia) [choline](!Wikipedia).

An interesting thing about piracetam use is that it doesn't do very much by itself^[See [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Piracetam#Side effects") or look at the literature, eg. ["Profound effects of combining choline and piracetam on memory enhancement and cholinergic function in aged rats"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0197458081900075) 2003]. It is charitably described as 'subtle'. The standard advice is to take a choline supplement with the piracetam: a gram of [soy lecithin](!Wikipedia), choline bitartate, or choline citrate.

Isn't this interesting? Presumably we are not Irish peasants consuming wretched diets of potato, potato, and more potato, with some mutton on the holidays. We are cognizant of how a good diet & exercise are prerequisites to brain power. Yet, a gram of straight choline still boosts piracetam's effects from subtle or placebo, to noticeable & measurable.

This suggests that perhaps a normal First World diet is choline-deficient. If even well-fed humans must economize on choline & acetylcholine, then surely our ancestors, who were worse off nutritionally, had to economize even more severely. Evolution would frown on squandering acetylcholine on idle thoughts like 'what was that witty saying by Ugh the other day?' That choline might be needed in the next famine! This suggestion is buttressed by one mouse experiment:

> "Administering choline supplementation to pregnant rats improved the performance of their pups, apparently as a result of changes in neural development in turn due to changes in *gene expression* (Meck et al. 1988; Meck and Williams 2003; Mellott et al. 2004). Given the ready availability of choline supplements, such prenatal enhancement, may already (inadvertently) be taking place in human populations. Supplementation of a mother’s diet during late and 3 months postpartum with long-chained fatty acids has also been demonstrated to improve cognitive performance in human children (Helland et al. 2003)."^[Emphasis added; Bostrom/Sandberg 2006.]

Past our embryo-hood, we can't tell our bodies that we have available as much choline as it could possibly need, that we value our synapses blazing at every moment more than a better chance of surviving a famine (which effectively no longer exist). So we have to override it, for our own good.

It's worth noting here that there is considerable overlap between #1 and #2. Whether you see piracetam as a conflict in values between evolution's worst-case planning and our desire for greater average or peak performance, or as a shift in optimal expenditure based on a historical drop in bulk quantities of choline, is a matter of preference.

#### Melatonin

How about [melatonin](Melatonin)? It is a clear-cut example of failing #3, but perhaps it passes under #1 like piracetam?

A [shift worker](!Wikipedia) is an obvious case of value discordance: humans are meant to work mostly during the day, with minimal dangerous night-time activity. Shift workers perversely insist on doing the exact opposite, even struggling against the circadian rhythms (to the detriment of [their health](!Wikipedia "Shift work sleep disorder"). Evolution wots not of your 'employment contract', pitiful human!

Regular people have a less extreme version of the shift worker's dilemma. The modern population doesn't rise and set with the sun, for imponderable reasons. (My personal theory is widespread _[akrasia](!Wikipedia)_: darkness overcomes [hyperbolic discounting](!Wikipedia) and forced the ancients to bed, but we have electric lighting and can stay up indefinitely.) This leads to a values mismatch, and a similar solution.

#### Modafinil

[Modafinil]() is another drug that seems suspiciously like a free lunch. The side-effects are minimal and rare, and the benefit quite unusual and striking: not needing to sleep for a night. The research on general cognitive benefits is mixed but real[^modafinil]. (My own [experience with armodafinil](Nootropics#armodafinil) was that after 41 hours of sleep-deprivation, my [working memory](!Wikipedia) and focus were actually *better* than normal as judged by [dual n-back](DNB FAQ) scores.) Yes, modafinil costs money, but that's not really relevant to our health or to Evolution. Yes, there is, anecdotally, a risk of coming to tolerate modafinil (although no addiction), but again that doesn't matter to Evolution - there would still be benefits before the tolerance kicked in.

What heuristic might we use?

- Chemically, modafinil does not seem to be so bizarre that evolution could not stumble across it or an equivalent mechanism, so probably we cannot appeal to #3, "evolutionary restrictions".
- Nor is it clear what value discordance might be involved. We could come up with one, though.

    If one theorized that modafinil came with a memory penalty, inasmuch as memory consolidation and the hippocampus seem to intimately involve sleep, then we might have a discordance where we value being able to produce and act more than being able to remember things. This might even be a sensible tradeoff for a modern man: *why not* sacrifice some ability to learn or remember long-term, since you can immediately gain back that capacity and more by suitable use of efficient memory techniques like [spaced repetition]()?
- \#1 seems promising. Like piracetam, there *is* something in short supply that modafinil would use more of: calories! While you are awake, you are burning more calories than while asleep. You are also - in the ancient evolutionary environment - perhaps exposing yourself to additional risks in the dark night. (This would be the [preservation & protection theory of sleep](!Wikipedia "Sleep#Preservation").)

    Resource usage is a real concern for the human brain, using as it does [<20%](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-the-brain-need-s) of energy. There are additional disadvantages to increased intelligence - larger heads would drive maternal & infant mortality rates even higher than they are. And it's worth noting that the human [cerebral cortex](!Wikipedia) is *not* any bigger than one would predict be extrapolating from gibbon or ape cortex volumes, despite the human lineage splitting off millions of years ago.[^cortex]

    Modafinil or modafinil-like traits might be selected against due to increased calorie expenditure, [decreased calorie consumption](!Wikipedia "Modafinil#Weight loss"), or risks of night-time activity. Either explanation fails in a modern environment; modern societies have murder and assault rates orders of magnitude lower than that seen among aborigines, and calories are so abundant that they have begun reducing fitness.

Is that last a convincing defense of modafinil against the EOC or Algernon's principle? It seems reasonable to me, if not as strong a defense as I would like.

[^cortex]: pg 2, ["The likelihood of cognitive enhancement"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21215768), Lynch et al 2011:

    > "Anatomists often resort to allometry when dealing with questions of selective pressures on brain regions. Applied to brain proportions, this involves collecting measurements for the region of interest—e.g., frontal cortex—for a series of animals within a given taxonomic group and then relating it to the volume or weight of the brains of those animals. This can establish with a relatively small degree of error whether a brain component in a particular species is larger than would be predicted from that species’ brain size. While there is not a great deal of evidence, studies of this type point to the conclusion that cortical subdivisions in humans, including association regions, are about as large as expected for an anthropoid primate with a 1350 cm3 brain. The volume of area 10 of human frontal cortex, for example, fits on the regression line (area 10 vs. whole brain) calculated from published data (Semendeferi et al., 2001) for a series composed of gibbons, apes and humans (Lynch and Granger, 2008). Given that this region is widely assumed to play a central role in executive functions and working memory, these observations do not encourage the idea that selective pressures for cognition have differentially shaped the proportions of human cortex. Importantly, this does not mean that those proportions are in any sense typical. The allometric equations involve different exponents for different regions, meaning that absolute proportions (e.g., primary sensory cortex vs. association cortex) change as brains grow larger. The balance of parts in the cortex of the enormous human brain is dramatically different than found in the much smaller monkey brain: area 10, for instance, occupies a much greater percentage of the cortex in man. But these effects seem to reflect expansion according to rules embedded in a conserved brain plan rather than selection for the specific pattern found in humans (Finlay et al., 2001)."
[^modafinil: Lynch et al 2011

    > "There is a large and often conflicting literature on the effects of modafinil on components of cognition. Some studies obtained a clear improvement in sustained attention in healthy human subjects (Randall et al., 2005) but others failed to find such effects (Turner et al., 2003). Similar discrepancies occur in the literature on animals (Waters et al., 2005). A recent, multi-factorial analysis provided  convincing evidence that moderate doses of modafinil improve attention in healthy middle-aged rats without affecting motivation or locomotor activity (Morgan et al., 2007). Importantly, these effects became evident only as attentional demands were increased. In all, it seems reasonable at this point to conclude that modafinil's effects on basic psychological state variables—wakefulness—can translate into selective improvements in attention.
    >
    > There is also a sizable literature suggesting that the above conclusion can be extended to memory encoding. An intriguing aspect of these studies in rodents (Beracochea et al., 2002) and humans (Turner et al., 2003; Baranski et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2004; Randall et al., 2005) is that they generally point to a drug influence on working memory as opposed to the encoding of long-term memory for specific information (Minzenberg and Carter, 2008). (A similar argument was made earlier for Ritalin.) For example, the above noted work on middle-aged rats found no evidence for accelerated acquisition of a visual discrimination problem, with minimal demands on working memory, despite clear improvements in attention. There  are, however, studies showing that modafinil accelerates the acquisition of simple rules (‘win-stay') (Beracochea et al., 2003), a spatial learning protocol (Shuman et al., 2009), and a non-match to position problem (Ward et al., 2004) in rodents. It is tempting to speculate that we are here seeing hierarchical effects of modafinil such that enhanced wakefulness produces greater attention that in turn improves both working memory and simple rule learning.
    >
    > But does the above sequence in fact improve the integrative psychological processes that constitute cognition? By far the greater part of the human studies with modafinil involves subjects with impairments to performance (sleep deprivation) or psychiatric dis- orders. None of the animal studies used recently developed tests (see below) that are explicitly intended to assess variables such as recall vs. recognition or ‘top-down’ forcing of attention. This leaves a small set of experiments involving performance by healthy human subjects on relatively simple learning/perceptual problems. A retrospective analysis of several studies led to the conclusion that modafinil does not produce a ‘global’ enhancement of cognition (Randall et al., 2005)."

#### Heroin

How about opiates? Morphine and other painkillers can easily be justified as evolution not knowing when a knife cut is by a murderous enemy and when it's by a kindly surgeon (which didn't exist way back when), and choosing to make us err on the side of always feeling pain. But recreational drug abuse?

\#3 doesn't work; opioids have been around for ages and work via the standard brain machinery. #1 doesn't seem too plausible either - what about modern society would favor opiate consumption outside of medicinal use? If one wishes to deaden the despair and ennui of living in a degenerate atheistic material culture, we have beer for that.^["Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink / For fellows whom it hurts to think."]

\#2 might work here as well, but this dumps us straight into the debate about the [War on Drugs](!Wikipedia) and what harm drug use does to the user & society. But even this is helpful: we now know on what basis to oppose drug use.
