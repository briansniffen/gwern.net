People discussion human-enhancement (especially [transhumanists](!Wikipedia)) have long recognized a pessimistic observation, sometimes dubbed "Algernon's law" or the "Algernon principle".

# Algernon's law

The famous story _[Flowers for Algernon](!Wikipedia)_ postulates surgery which triples the IQ score of the retarded protagonist - but which comes with the devastating side-effects of the gain being both temporary and sometimes fatal. [Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia) expands the thought out in his essay ["Algernon's Law"](http://web.archive.org/web/200102021712/http://sysopmind.com/algernon.html), stating it simply as:

> "Any simple major enhancement to human intelligence is a net evolutionary disadvantage."

The lesson is that Mother Nature know best. Or alternately, [TANSTAAFL](!Wikipedia): "there ain't no such thing as a [free lunch](!Wikipedia)". Often, if you use a drug or surgery to optimize something, you will discover penalties elsewhere. If you try to stop aging, you might find that you have just encouraged cancer; or if you try to enhance attention with an amphetamine, you destroy creativity, or if the amphetamines reduce sleep, you damage memory consolidation or peripheral awareness[^sleep]; or improving memory also increases sensitivity to pain[^doogie] and so on.

[^sleep]: [Nick Bostrom](!Wikipedia) & [Anders Sandberg](!Wikipedia)'s ["Converging Cognitive Enhancements"](http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/converging.pdf) (2006):

    > Keeping awake using stimulants prevents the memory consolidation that would have taken place during sleep, and enhanced concentration ability may impair the ability to notice things in peripheral awareness.
[^doogie]: Bostrom/Sandberg 2006:

    > "Genetic memory enhancement has been demonstrated in rats and mice. In normal animals, during maturation expression of the NR2B subunit of the [N-methyl-D-aspartate](!Wikipedia "NMDA receptor") (NMDA) receptor is gradually replaced with expression of the NR2A subunit, something that may be linked to the lower brain plasticity in adult animals. Tsien's group (Tang et al. 1999) modified mice to overexpress the NR2B. The NR2B ['Doogie'](!Wikipedia "Doogie mice") mice demonstrated improved memory performance, both in terms of acquisition and retention. This included unlearning of fear conditioning, which is believed to be due to the learning of a secondary memory (Falls et al. 1992). The modification also made the mice more sensitive to certain forms of pain, suggesting a nontrivial trade-off between two potential enhancement goals (Wei et al. 2001)."

## EOC

In ["The Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement"](http://www.nickbostrom.com/evolution.pdf), [Nick Bostrom](!Wikipedia) puts this principle as:

> If the proposed intervention would result in an enhancement, why have we not already evolved to be that way?

Obviously we humans do intervene all the time, and many of those interventions are worthwhile. Women, for example, are big fans of [birth control](!Wikipedia "Combined oral contraceptive pill"), and if the female reproductive system isn't controlled by evolution, nothing is.

### Loopholes

There may be no free lunches, but might there be some cheap lunches? Yudkowsky's formulation points out several ways to escape the law:

1. interventions may not be *simple*

    So one might find major enhancements through some very complex surgery or prosthetic; perhaps brain implants which expand memory or enable (controlled) [wireheading](!Wikipedia)
2. the simple interventions may not lead to a *major* enhancement

    Nutritional supplements are examples; it makes perfect sense that fixing a chemical deficiency could be a simple matter and enhance fitness - but one would expect minor mental enhancements and this effect would not generalize to very many people. (Similarly, most nootropics do not do very much.)
3. the intervention may be simple, give major enhancements, but result in a *net* loss of fitness

    The famous [Ashkenazi theory of intelligence](!Wikipedia "Ashkenazi intelligence") comes to mind. According to this theory, the Ashkenazi were forced into occupations demanding intelligence, and micro-selected for high IQ. Except the high IQ genes were not previously prevalent among either Jews or gentiles because - like [sickle-cell anemia](!Wikipedia) -s when they became too prevalent, they result in horrible diseases like [Tay-Sachs](!Wikipedia).

Bostrom also offers 3 categories of ways in which interventions can escape his 'EOC':

1. "*Changed tradeoffs*. Evolution 'designed' the system for operation in one type of environment, but now we wish to deploy it in a very different type of environment. It is not surprising, then, that we might be able to modify the system better to meet the demands imposed on it by the new environment."
2. "*Value discordance*. There is a discrepancy between the standards by which evolution measured the quality of her work, and the standards that we wish to apply. Even if evolution had managed to build the finest reproduction-and-survival machine imaginable, we may still have reason to change it because what we value is not primarily to be maximally effective inclusive-fitness optimizers.
3. "*Evolutionary restrictions*. We have access to various tools, materials, and techniques that were unavailable to evolution. Even if our engineering talent is far inferior to evolution’s, we may nevertheless be able to achieve certain things that stumped evolution, thanks to these novel aids."

### Examples

Bostrom's criteria are more general, so we'll use them. Birth control is a clear example of satisfying loophole #2, 'value discordance'. Many women do not value having a dozen children while young; they would rather have just 2 at a time of their choosing. Pacemakers are an example of #3: evolution couldn't afford to engineer more reliable hearts, in part for lack of electronic microchips. Many traits related to nutrition fall into the category of #1.^[["Adaptive no more: A potential benefit in prehistoric lean times, genetic variant may increase risk of gestational diabetes today"](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/69610/title/Adaptive_no_more), or see the [thrifty gene hypothesis](!Wikipedia).]

How about supplements? Most supplements are just tweaking biochemical processes, and don't obviously fall under 1, 2, or 3. [Melatonin](!Wikipedia), for example, may seem particularly questionable as one's body secrets considerable quantities in an intricate cycle.

#### Piracetam

Or in ["Growing up is hard"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xd/growing_up_is_hard/), [Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia) remarks that Bostrom's EOC is:

> "...one reason to be wary of, say, [cholinergic](!Wikipedia) memory enhancers [such as [piracetam](!Wikipedia)]: if they have no downsides, why doesn't the brain produce more [acetylcholine](!Wikipedia) already?  Maybe you're using up a limited memory capacity, or forgetting something else..."

Let's consider the specific case of piracetam. Piracetam is so old and has so many studies on its efficacy (real if not substantial) and safety (utterly) that it screens off a lot of secondary considerations.

- Might piracetam escape the EOC with #3?
- No. Whatever receptors or buttons piracetam pushes could already be pushed by the brain the usual way. There is nothing novel about piracetam in that sense.

- Might piracetam escape the EOC with #2?
- Perhaps. Hard to see how piracetam trades off reproductive fitness for something else, though. It's safe, unlike other substances such as tobacco.

- Might piracetam escape the EOC with #1?
- Probably. Many tradeoffs are different in contemporary First World countries than from the proverbial Stone Age veldt.

A 'cholinergic' operates by encouraging higher levels of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter; acetylcholine is one of the most common neurotransmitters. If serotonin is loosely associated with mood, we might say that acetylcholine is loosely associated with the 'velocity' of thoughts in the brain. If one is using more acetylcholine, one needs to create more acetylcholine (the brain cannot borrow indefinitely like the US federal government). Acetylcholine is made out of the [essential nutrient](!Wikipedia) [choline](!Wikipedia).

An interesting thing about piracetam use, as I and many other users can attest, is that it doesn't do very much by itself. It is charitably described as 'subtle'. The standard advice is to take a choline supplement with the piracetam: a gram of [soy lecithin](!Wikipedia), choline bitartate, or choline citrate.

Isn't this interesting? Presumably we are not Irish peasants consuming wretched diets of potato, potato, and more potato, with some mutton on the holidays. We are cognizant of how a good diet & exercise are prerequisites to brain power. Yet, a gram of straight choline still boosts piracetam's effects from subtle or placebo, to noticeable & measurable.

This suggests that perhaps a normal First World diet is choline-deficient. If even well-fed humans must economize on choline & acetylcholine, then surely our ancestors, who were worse off nutritionally, had to economize even more severely. Evolution would frown on squandering acetylcholine on idle thoughts like 'what was that witty saying by Ugh the other day?' That choline might be needed in the next famine! This suggestion is buttressed by one mouse experiment:

> "Administering choline supplementation to pregnant rats improved the performance of their pups, apparently as a result of changes in neural development in turn due to changes in *gene expression* (Meck et al. 1988; Meck and Williams 2003; Mellott et al. 2004). Given the ready availability of choline supplements, such prenatal enhancement, may already (inadvertently) be taking place in human populations. Supplementation of a mother’s diet during late and 3 months postpartum with long-chained fatty acids has also been demonstrated to improve cognitive performance in human children (Helland et al. 2003)."^[Emphasis added; Bostrom/Sandberg 2006.]

Past our embryohood, we can't tell our bodies that we have available as much choline as it could possibly need, that we value our synapses blazing at every moment more than a better chance of surviving a famine (which effectively no longer exist). So we have to override it, for our own good.

It's worth noting here that there is considerable overlap between #1 and #2. Whether you see piracetam as a conflict in values between evolution's worst-case planning and our desire for greater average or peak performance, or as a shift in optimal expenditure based on a historical drop in bulk quantities of choline, is a matter of preference.

#### Melatonin

How about [melatonin](Melatonin)? It is a clear-cut example of failing #3, but perhaps it passes under #1 like piracetam?

A [shift worker](!Wikipedia) is an obvious case of value discordance: humans are meant to work mostly during the day, with minimal dangerous night-time activity. Shift workers perversely insist on doing the exact opposite, even struggling against the circadian rhythms (to the detriment of [their health](!Wikipedia "Shift work sleep disorder"). Evolution wots not of your 'employment contract', pitiful human!

Regular people have a less extreme version of the shift worker's dilemma. The modern population doesn't rise and set with the sun, for imponderable reasons. (My personal theory is widespread _[akrasia](!Wikipedia)_: darkness overcomes [hyperbolic discounting](!Wikipedia) and forced the ancients to bed, but we have electric lighting and can stay up indefinitely.) This leads to a values mismatch, and a similar solution.

#### Heroin

How about opiates? Morphine and other painkillers can easily be justified as evolution not knowing when a knife cut is by a murderous enemy and when it's by a kindly surgeon (which didn't exist way back when), and choosing to make us err on the side of always feeling pain. But recreational drug abuse?

\#3 doesn't work; opioids have been around for ages and work via the standard brain machinery. #1 doesn't seem too plausible either - what about modern society would favor opiate consumption outside of medicinal use? If one wishes to deaden the despair and ennui of living in a degenerate atheistical material culture, we have beer for that.^["Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink / For fellows whom it hurts to think."]

\#2 might work here as well, but this dumps us straight into the debate about the [War on Drugs](!Wikipedia) and what harm drug use does to the user & society. But even this is helpful: we now know on what basis to oppose drug use.
