The folklore of people thinking about enhancing humans (especially [transhumanists](!Wikipedia)) have long recognized one basic argument which applies especially to chemical-related enhancement: the 'Algernon principle'.

# Algernon's principle

The famous story _[Flowers for Algernon](!Wikipedia)_ postulates surgery which triples the IQ score of the retarded protagonist - but which comes with the devastating side-effects of being both temporary and sometimes fatal.

The lesson is that Mother Nature know best. Or alternately, [TANSTAAFL](!Wikipedia): "there ain't no such thing as a [free lunch](!Wikipedia)".

## EOC

In ["The Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement"](http://www.nickbostrom.com/evolution.pdf), [Nick Bostrom](!Wikipedia) puts this principle as:

> If the proposed intervention would result in an enhancement, why have we not already evolved to be that way?

Obviously we humans do intervene all the time, and many of those interventions are quite nice. Women, for example, are big fans of [birth control](!Wikipedia "Combined oral contraceptive pill"), and if the female reproductive system isn't controlled by evolution, I don't know what bodily parts are.

### Loopholes

So, Bostrom offers 3 categories of ways in which a good intervention escapes his 'EOC':

1. "Changed tradeoffs. Evolution 'designed' the system for operation in one type of environment, but now we wish to deploy it in a very different type of environment. It is not surprising, then, that we might be able to modify the system better to meet the demands imposed on it by the new environment."
2. "Value discordance. There is a discrepancy between the standards by which evolution measured the quality of her work, and the standards that we wish to apply. Even if evolution had managed to build the finest reproduction-and-survival machine imaginable, we may still have reason to change it because what we value is not primarily to be maximally effective inclusive-fitness optimizers.
3. "Evolutionary restrictions. We have access to various tools, materials, and techniques that were unavailable to evolution. Even if our engineering talent is far inferior to evolutionâ€™s, we may nevertheless be able to achieve certain things that stumped evolution, thanks to these novel aids."

### Examples

Birth control is a clear example of #2. Many women do not value having a dozen or more children; they would rather have no more than 2, and those 2 at a time of their choosing. Pace makers are an example of #3: evolution couldn't afford more reliable hearts, in part for lack of electronic microchips.

How about supplements? Most supplements are just tweaking biochemical processes, and don't obviously fall under 1, 2, or 3. [Melatonin](!Wikipedia), for example, may seem particularly questionable as one's body secrets considerable quantities in an intricate cycle.

#### Piracetam

Or in ["Growing up is hard"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xd/growing_up_is_hard/), [Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia) remarks that Bostrom's EOC is:

> "...one reason to be wary of, say, [cholinergic](!Wikipedia) memory enhancers [such as [piracetam](!Wikip)]: if they have no downsides, why doesn't the brain produce more [acetylcholine](!Wikipedia) already?  Maybe you're using up a limited memory capacity, or forgetting something else..."

Let's consider the specific case of piracetam. Piracetam is so old and has so many studies on its efficacy (real if not substantial) and safety (utterly) that it screens off a lot of secondary considerations.

Might piracetam escape the EOC with #3?

No. Whatever receptors or buttons piracetam pushes could already be pushed by the brain the usual way. There is nothing novel about piracetam in that sense.

Might piracetam escape the EOC with #2?

Perhaps.

Might piracetam escape the EOC with #1?

Quite possibly. Many tradeoffs are different in contemporary First World countries than from the proverbial Stone Age veldt.

A 'cholinergic' operates by encouraging higher levels of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter; acetylcholine is one of the most common neurotransmitters. If serotonin is loosely associated with mood, we might say that acetylcholine is loosely associated with the 'velocity' of thoughts in the brain. If one is using more acetylcholine, one needs to create more acetylcholine (the brain cannot borrow indefinitely like the US federal government). Acetylcholine is made out of the [essential nutrient](!Wikipedia) [choline](!Wikipedia).

An interesting thing about piracetam use, as I and many other users can attest, is that it doesn't do very much by itself. It is charitably described as 'subtle'. The standard advice is to take a choline supplement with the piracetam: a gram or 2 of [soy lecithin](!Wikipedia), choline bitartate, or choline citrate.

Isn't this interesting? Presumably we are not Irish peasants consuming wretched diets of potato, potato, and more potato, with some mutton on the holidays. We are cognizant of how a good diet & exercise are prerequisites to brain power. Yet, a gram of straight choline still boosts piracetam's effects from subtle or placebo, to noticeable & measurable.

This suggests that perhaps even a normal diet is choline-deficient. If even well-fed humans must economize on choline & acetylcholine, then surely our ancestors were worse off, and so evolution would then frown on squandering acetylcholine on idle thoughts like 'what was that witty saying by Ugh the other day?'

We can't tell our bodies that we have available as much choline as it could possibly need, that we value our synapses blazing at every moment more than an infinitesimally better chance of surviving a drought. So we have to override it, for our own good.

It's worth noting here that there is considerable overlap between #1 and #2. Whether you see piracetam as a conflict in values between evolution's worst-case planning and our desire for greater average or peak performance, or as a shift in optimal expenditure based on a historical drop in bulk quantities of choline, is a matter of preference.

#### Melatonin

How about melatonin? It is a clear-cut example of failing #3, but perhaps it passes under #2/1 like piracetam?

A [shift worker](!Wikipedia) is an obvious case of value discordance: humans are meant to work mostly during the day, with minimal dangerous night-time activity. Shift workers perversely insist on doing the exact opposite, even struggling against the circadian rhythms. Evolution wots not of your 'employment contracts', pitiful humans!

Regular people have a less extreme version of the shift worker's dilemma. The modern population doesn't rise and set with the sun, for imponderable reasons. (My personal theory is widespread _[akrasia](!Wikipedia)_: darkness overcomes [hyperbolic discounting](!Wikipedia) and forced the ancients to bed, but we have electric lighting and can stay up indefinitely.) This leads to a values mismatch, and a similar solution.

#### Heroin

How about opiates? Morphine and other painkillers can easily be justified as evolution not knowing when a knife cut is by a murderous enemy and when it's by a kindly surgeon (which didn't exist way back when), and choosing to make us err on the side of always feeling pain. But recreational drug abuse?

#3 doesn't work; opioids have been around for ages and work via the standard brain machinery. #1 doesn't seem too plausible either - what about modern society would favor opiate consumption outside of medicinal use? If one wishes to deaden the despair and ennui of living in a degenerate atheistical material culture, we have beer for that.

#2 might work here as well, but this dumps us straight into the debate about the [War on Drugs](!Wikipedia) and what harm drug use does to the user & society. But even this is helpful: we now know on what basis to oppose drug use.
