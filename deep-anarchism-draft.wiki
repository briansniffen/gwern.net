'''Deep anarchism''' is a variant of [[anarchism]] which holds that [[states]] are consensual illusions with no [[objective reality]]. They are persistent mass hallucinations that could be ablished along with people's belief in it.
This seems to have always been completely true: cut the mercenaries' mental bonds of loyalty, and the state goes poof.
