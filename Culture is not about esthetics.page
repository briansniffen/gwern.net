OB comment about specialists vs generalists:

> Here’s a thought. Are these broad questions increasing in number or decreasing in number or static?
> If they are either of the latter, then fewer undergraduates able to grapple about them may not be bad, since the population is growing so much. Per capita, the number of generalists can shrink but still be going up in absolute terms.
> Another thought. These questions tend to be very old. Old questions have been thought about by many people with many perspectives, and it’s unlikely you’ll make a new worthwhile contribution compared to thinking about new questions. So since these generalist questions seem to usually be very old and unrewarding, you would want most people to be focused on new questions.
> (I guess you would want as few people working on old questions as it takes to apply new observations and methods to the old questions, in the hope that the new observation/method might finally crack it.)

> "The climate of our culture is changing. Under these new rains, new suns, small things grow great, and what was great grows small; whole species disappear and are replaced." --[Randall Jarrell](!Wikipedia)^["A Sad Heart at the Supermarket", _Daedalus_, vol. 89, no. 2 (Spring 1960)]

The [Amazon Kindle](!Wikipedia) has ignited the [ebook](!Wikipedia) market by providing a [e-ink](!Wikipedia) interface which is visually competitive with paper, and easy access to a remarkable fraction of Amazon's inventory. It's very nice.

The pricing of ebooks is controversial^[["E-books spark battle inside the publishing industry"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/24/AR2009122403326.html), _Washington Post_, 27 December 200]; why should an ebook cost as much as the book? The Kindle's ebooks are small digital files, as opposed to multi-pound slabs of exactingly manufactured wood and cloth[^printing]. The former is delivered wirelessly, while the latter requires globe-spanning transport networks. Surely there is vast overhead for the paper, and ebook prices should reflect their marginal cost of production of 0 cents?

Not many expect ebooks to be priced in cents, since the author expects to be paid a fair bit for her writing, and the publisher expects to be paid for editing & formatting it, and Amazon is there discreetly coughing for its share[^scratch]. So it won't be 0¢, but why not $3 or less?

# The price is not right

In a sense, this is a [very easy](!Wikipedia "Law of supply and demand") question. The right price for ebooks is whatever the market will bear. If $3 is not the right price, then consumers will not buy, and the price will continue to fall until they do.

In another sense, it's a difficult question as some people seem to be thinking in medieval terms with the moral concept of the '[just price](!Wikipedia)', which is inapplicable to books[^just].

## Subsidies

But the presupposition of a discussion of how to ensure a profitable price level mutually acceptable to consumers & corporate publishers is that the publishers *should* survive. That is: if books are not economically sustainable at natural e-book prices (eg. $3), will society be worse off? Should publishers or novelists be subsidized[^subsidy]?

The more I think about it, the harder I find justifying any subsidy.

We value high author royalties because this allows authors to specialize in being authors; specialization is a good thing because it allows authors to produce more than they otherwise would; and higher production is good because we value the fruits thereof.

But higher production isn't always good; production can be misguided or wasted ^[cf. [broken window fallacy](!Wikipedia)]. (And strengthened copyright law may not be an effective subsidy regardless.^[The academic literature is mixed; for example, some find little to no deterimental effect to Internet-borne copyright infringement: <http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/06/file-sharing-has-weakened-copyrightand-helped-society.ars>])

# 100 apples in the barrel

> "Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,\
> For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain." --William Shakespeare^[[_King Richard II_](!Wikipedia "Richard II (play)")]

Suppose we all have 100 apples. Our lives do not revolve around apples, though we like them well enough. But still, 100 is too many; even if we ate 5 a day, the rest would go bad before we ate them. And of course, it's unlikely that any of us will go to the greengrocers and buy *more*. Our [marginal utility](!Wikipedia) of apples has plunged to zero^[Or below; I dislike clutter.].

From our perspective, the farmer bringing a truck of apples to the greengrocers has wasted his labor. Let's hope he'll find *something* to do with those surplus apples so the resources that went into making them were not wasted - maybe bake some apple pies, or compost them all.

Now suppose this wasn't a one-time gift. We live in a magic world where everyone gets 100 apples a week. Here the farmer's entire career is wasted. Isn't he wasting his life? He's a smart fellow; no reason he couldn't go do something more useful.

We could invent ways to employ this farmer. Perhaps every week he breaks into everybody's kitchens and steals their apples so they have to buy apples from him. Perhaps he'll run a large marketing campaign to convince everyone that his apples are superior to the magical apples. Perhaps some people get [Granny Smith](!Wikipedia) but really wanted [Red Delicious](!Wikipedia), and he runs an apple-trading hub, filling in deficits with his apples. Perhaps he lives on government subsidy checks & farms apples as a hobby. Or something.

But nevertheless, these apple-farmers represent a [dead-weight loss](!Wikipedia). That's bad.

# 100 books on the shelf

> "Do technology and economic growth create problems? Certainly. But as Maurice Chevalier said about the disadvantages of growing old, consider the alternative.\
> ...if you chose to live in Renaissance Florence you would not be able to enjoy [Cézanne](!Wikipedia) and [Picasso](!Wikipedia). In [Johnson](!Wikipedia "Samuel Johnson")'s London, you would not be able to listen to Beethoven or Brahms. In _La [Belle Époque](!Wikipedia)_, you would not be able to read [Joyce](!Wikipedia "James Joyce") or [Faulkner](!Wikipedia "William Faulkner"). To live in today's world is not only to have access to all the best that has come before, but also to have a breadth and ease of access that is comparably greater than that enjoyed even by our parents, let alone earlier generations." --[Charles Murray](!Wikipedia "Charles Murray (author)"), _[Human Accomplishment](!Wikipedia)_

Now, can we apply this analogy? I don't have 100 apples, but perhaps I have - 100 novels.

Not any novels, but [science fiction](!Wikipedia) novels. Nor any 100 Sci-Fi novels, but the winners of the 2 most prestigious SF awards for the last 50 years: the [Hugo](!Wikipedia "Hugo Award") and [Nebula Award](!Wikipedia)s.

## Reading them

> "Time destroys the groundless conceits of men; it confirms decisions founded on reality." --[Cicero](!Wikipedia)^[_De Natura Deorum_, Bk II.2]

Suppose I read the 100 at the rate of 1 a week[^rate], or 52 a year. I will finish them in ~2 years.

It will take an appreciable fraction of my life to read a vanishingly small fraction of one small fiction genre, that itself has existed for less than 2 centuries and been written almost exclusively in 2 countries[^geo].

And what if I want to read the prequels and sequels? Not all winners are as prolific in sequels & prequels as _[Dune](!Wikipedia "Dune universe")_, but these winners include many duologies and trilogies (or more)[^sequels]. I can probably expect to lose another 2 or 6 years to them. Certainly, I can expect it to take another 4 years to read the 2 top runner-ups for each award. And did I mention that these awards have multiple categories? Many of SF's greatest works are short stories or novellas, which compete for different Nebula & Hugo awards.

And of course, it's not like the Hugo & Nebula awards are the definitive list of SF 'books to read' - _[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction](!Wikipedia)_ treats of hundreds of writers, and mentions thousands of works; _[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy](!Wikipedia)_ has more than 4000 entries. The more thoroughly I search, the longer my reading list becomes.

## New = bad

> "It is worth serious consideration how great an amount of time -- their own and other people's -- and of paper is wasted by this swarm of mediocre poets, and how injurious their influence is. For the public always seizes on what is new, and shows even more inclination to what is perverse and dull, as being akin to its own nature. These works of the mediocre, therefore, draw the public away and hold it back from genuine masterpieces, and from the education they afford. Thus they work directly against the benign influence of genius, ruin taste more and more, and so arrest the progress of the age." --[Arthur Schopenhauer](!Wikipedia)^[_[The World as Will and Representation](!Wikipedia)_, section 51, footnote 41]

The list is now 8 years in length; if the SF industry had imploded the day I started, I would not have noticed.

I would be better off, actually, if the industry *did* implode! The last SF or Fantasy I read was [Brandon Sanderson](!Wikipedia)'s _[Mistborn](!Wikipedia "Mistborn series")_ trilogy. It was good, but I know there are better. My reading time is finite, and reading _Mistborn_ pushed out reading [Gene Wolfe](!Wikipedia)'s _[Book of the Long Sun](!Wikipedia)_ tetralogy - which I ultimately enjoyed more. If the industry had imploded before _Mistborn_ was published, I would have read _Long Sun_ instead.

It wouldn't be difficult to spend the rest of my life reading only SF published before 2009, and it would be more efficient as time is the keenest critic.

The connection to other aspects of modern life and _[akrasia](!Wikipedia)_ is apparent: there's a [Gresham's Law](!Wikipedia) whereby cheap yet unsatisfying works will push out more satisfying but more demanding entertainment. Humans suffer from [hyperbolic discounting](!Wikipedia); we may know that in the long run, _Mistborn_ will be forgotten when _Long Sun_ is remembered, and that once we get started, we will enjoy it more - yet when the moment comes to choose, we prefer the choice of immediate pleasure.

### Generalizing this

> "Reading anything less than 50 years old is like drinking new wine: permissible once or twice a year and usually followed by regret and a headache....I definitely have followed that dictum. Maybe a little too much so, in that I rarely read anything modern at all. When it comes to books. I don’t follow that rule when it comes to music or movies or blogs. But on the level of books, there is so much good stuff out there that has stood the test of time, I don’t run out of interesting things to read." --topologist [Robert Ghrist](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~ghrist/)^[["Applied topology and Dante: an interview with Robert Ghrist"](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/09/13/applied-topology-and-dante-an-interview-with-robert-ghrist/), John D. Cook 13 September 2010.]

But reading only SF is impoverishing. I always wanted to get into mysteries and French literature. But those will take at least 2 decades. Now I'm in my 50s. I'd better hurry if I ever want to read English or Chinese literature, or any nonfiction!

So, why do I care what happens to the SF market? How does it concern me that the short story magazines are collapsing and will train no new writers? I have no need of them. I already have 100 apples.

### Music

Or how about the genre of classical music? I once saw a complete collection of [J.S. Bach](!Wikipedia) in 160 CDs. I've no idea how many hours of music that is, and am too frightened to calculate it. And how many listens would it take to reasonably appreciate it? A lifetime perhaps.

Why should I care about some publisher trying to record another CD of the [Brandenburg Concertos](!Wikipedia)? I'm not a conductor, I will hear no improvement. To me, there is no difference between the world's greatest violinist and the 10^th^-greatest.

### Movies

Or consider another medium: movies. Have you seen the [IMDB](!Wikipedia "Internet Movie Database")'s [Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top) movies? There are excellent movies in there. Some are profound, others moving, and not a few profoundly moving. Why are you going to watch _[Transformers 2](!Wikipedia "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen")_ or _[Ice Age 3](!Wikipedia "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs")_? For entertainment value? But there are movies in that list which are far more entertaining, I assure you.

Even if you've seen the top 50, there's another 200 to choose from. If you think the IMDB is too faddish and Internet-centric, there's no shortage of other lists - the _New York Times_ would be happy to tell you all about ["The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made"](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html) (6 years at 3 movies a week). And what about television?

### Genres in general

> "When will we realize that the fact that we can become accustomed to anything, however disgusting at first, makes it necessary to examine carefully everything we have become accustomed to?" --George Bernard Shaw^[_A Treatise on Parents and Children_, 1910]

Any field over a century old has built up a stock of masterpieces that could fill a lifetime.

Fields that are new, or still technically developing, may not have enough. For example, video games - even the greatest arcade games from 20 or 30 years ago such as _[Pac-Man](!Wikipedia)_ or _[Space Invaders](!Wikipedia) has a hard time competing against mediocre contemporary games.

But even new genres have problems with the general surplus of art. After all, while we may not be able divide up all art into categories of 'painting' or 'Russian novel', there is something we *can* count and which is absolutely crucial to the argument: time. Our lives are only so long, and they are denominated quite precisely, second by second. We have 500,000 hours^[$\text{total hours} - \text{sleeping hours}$, or, $80 \text{years} \times 365 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 700800$; $700800 - (\frac{1}{3} \times 700800) = 467200$].

Does it matter whether it's a ballet or a novel if we devote 3 of those hours to it? Artworks may be as non-commodified or incomparable or subjective as we please, but we can't get around our own limits. For our finite lives, it's good enough if we call it art. And we don't necessarily need to assume substitution of works *across* genres; given enough time, any genre will outrun your lifespan. As genres multiply, it becomes ever more difficult to argue that some new and small genre is the only one that can satisfy one and that it merits subsidy.

## Media shock

> "The soul has no assignments, neither cooks\
> Nor referees: it wastes its time. It wastes its time.\
> Here in this enclave there are centuries\
> For you to waste...\
> The books, just leafed through, whisper endlessly." --Randal Jarrell^["A Girl in a Library", lines 32-29; _The Seven-League Crutches_]

I hope I've made my point: we live in an age of *utter* media abundance. Like none before us, we can partake of the greatest works in all mediums of all ages. We do not sip from a fountain laboriously supplied by hard-working artists & authors, nor even guzzle from a fire-hose hooked up to a printing press; we are being shot off Niagara Falls. The impact alone will kill us.

This has been true for a very long time. The [Bodleian Library](!Wikipedia) has been running out of space since the 1970s; it ordered a 13-acre warehouse with 153 miles of high-density shelving - and expects this to suffice for just 20 years^[["Vast bookstore opens as famed library runs out of space"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11484494), _BBC News_, 6 October 2010]. This abundance may not have been obvious before the Internet. The largest collection a person would ever run into would be his local library, and that is reassuringly small. It has a few dozen thousand volumes, perhaps, of which someone will want to read only a small fraction. A good reader could get through 1 book a day on average, and so one *could* encompass the whole in a lifetime. Who visits the Library of Congress and is struck by the physical reality of dozens of millions of items? No one. One couldn't hope to buy more than one could consume either, as books and media are expensive per hour. (Niche consumer can expect even worse prices; at one point, American anime fans were paying more than $40 for <30 minutes^[Nor was this the extreme for that period. ["Remember when you had to pay 50 bucks for a two-episode VHS tape from Japan, plus shipping? Or, shudder, a hundred dollars to import a LaserDisc for a two-episode OAV that turned out to be total garbage? Those were dark times, my friend."](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2011-02-25) (_Anime News Network_)].)

But the Internet puts the equivalent of multiple Libraries of Congresses at one's fingertips. One only has to visit a BitTorrent tracker website and see the entries scroll off the screen for hundreds of pages, each representing a massive collection soaking up endless weeks and years. All of it is there for the taking. It can't be ignored. Everyone who wants a particular webpage or album or movie is forced to see the results of their search queries and muse, 'if my narrow request turned up *this* much - how much must there be in all?'

Even individual sites now surpass the human. Who can view every article and document and photograph and edit that streams through Wikipedia every second? I have seen sober estimates that if one were to start at the first Wikipedia article and read alphabetically, the percentage of Wikipedia one has read will go down over time, the articles were created so fast.

This is a situation that old nostrums do not address. We do not need more creativity for the sake of creation^[See also Robin Hanson's brief essay. ["The Myth Of Creativity: Innovation matters, but releasing your inner bohemian isn't the answer"](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_27/b3991115.htm)].

# Let's ban new books

> "Consequently, it is soon recognised that they write for the sake of filling up the paper, and this is the case sometimes with the best authors... As soon as this is perceived the book should be thrown away, for time is precious. As a matter of fact, the author is cheating the reader as soon as he writes for the sake of filling up paper; because his pretext for writing is that he has something to impart...It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth writing. What an inestimable advantage it would be, if, in every branch of literature, there existed only a few but excellent books!" --Arthur Schopenhauer, ["On Authorship and Style"](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/essays/chapter3.html)

With our too too short lives, and so much to see, one does oneself a great disservice by consuming anything but the best.

And thus, do not authors & artists do us a disservice by creating mediocrity we, being only human, will at least try? Maybe these authors & artists are only creating [attractive nuisance](!Wikipedia)s!

Let's look back on the argument:

1. Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.\
    At least, it ought not to encourage inefficiency. It may not do this perfectly, but this is still a desiderata; special pleading for some activity, saying that some other activity or market is far more economically inefficient, is not a good reason.
2. If some good _a_ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing & available good _b_ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use _a_ and not _b_.
3. Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.
4. By 2 & 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.

∴ By 1 & 4: Society ought to discourage new art

In short: old stuff is as good as the new, and it's cheaper; so making new stuff is wasteful.

## Objections

One of the basic tactics with any objectionable argument is to see whether any of the inference steps are faulty. In this case, we can see that there is nothing wrong with the logic. So we're left with rejecting premises, or accepting the conclusion.

Here's what we can reject:

1. that societies ought to encourage efficiency
2. that creating something when there's an existing object is inefficient
3. that old books can replace new ones.

### Society doesn't care?

Now, #1 seems unobjectionable. To reject that premise is to argue either that society ought to discourage economic efficiency, or be neutral about efficiency.

The former is obviously false. There are governmental programs and policies acknowledged to be economically inefficient, but everyone agrees that their inefficiency is a flaw, and the programs are justifiable not because of, but despite the inefficiency - they supposedly deliver some other benefit which compensates for the cost. If there were some alternative which was efficient, it would be better.

Neutrality is not so obviously wrong. But voters consistently elect candidates who promise to grow the economy & make things better; and governments have a long history of supporting projects - like bridges & highways - whose justifications are that government ought to help make the economy more efficient. So it seems wrong as well.

### What's efficiency anyway?

Premise #2 is weaker. To me, this premise about substitutability seems so obvious that I'm not sure how to defend it. If you need a glove, and you have a perfectly good one already, isn't spending $20 on a new glove the same thing as throwing your money away? Isn't #2 a generalization of this obvious fact?

If you reject #2, I'm not really sure what economics you're working under. But there are a few objections we could classify under this heading, generally postulating [externalities](!Wikipedia), such as Keynesian thinking about stimulus spending.

#### They Snatched Society's Brain!

An interlocutor might suggest that perhaps the creation & consumption of new fiction or novels serves some laudable purpose beyond swelling libraries.

Now, what good deeds could only *new* works produce? Certainly it's not edifying & educating our youth; it is not as if the pedagogy of Euclidean geometry has changed much over the last millennia, nor is 20th century fiction known for teaching moral lessons.

But new fiction could be an important societal mechanism for discussing new developments and for pondering the future. SF would be an excellent example of this; the name preferred by connoisseurs - '[speculative fiction](!Wikipedia)' - points straight to this benefit, and creators often cite this as the non-entertainment value of their works[^sleepdealer]. Who but knows that the constant undercurrent of computers & cloning & space travel in SF has not helped society prepare for the future? Hasn't SF directly inspired any number of young men & women to enter the hard sciences (as opposed to dedicating their talents to, say, finance), with benefits redounding to all humanity? What's a dead-weight loss of billions a year compared with landing on the Moon?

I find this argument uncomfortable. It's arguing that fiction is justified inasmuch as it makes superior propaganda[^propaganda]. It may be propaganda in the service of a noble & good cause, and swaying someone to choose a career in science is not as evil as propagandizing children into clearing Iraqi minefields with their bodies - but the morality of it is difficult.

And a utilitarian might cavil about the benefits. Fiction can be unfairly persuasive, bypassing our rational faculties[^hanson]. (SF is often good inversely proportional to how much scientific truth it contains.) The author's motive may be malign as easily as benign.

As a society, is it *good* to have our discussions and views about incredibly important matters like space exploration hijacked by fiction? It's hard to see why fiction would yield discussion of equal or superior quality to discussions based on non-fiction. [Fictional evidence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/) is particularly fallacious. Consider discussions of [Artificial Intelligence](!Wikipedia); if one sees any mention of fictional entities like [HAL 9000](!Wikipedia) or [Skynet](!Wikipedia "Skynet (Terminator)"), one can stop reading immediately, for the exchange is surely worthless. A discussion about the nonfictional entities [SHRDLU](!Wikipedia) or [Eurisko](!Wikipedia), though, might be worthwhile.

So either fiction is effective as propaganda and setting societal agendas, or it isn't. If the latter, then the loss is nil; if the former, then fiction is dangerous!

#### Two sides of the same organ

> "Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And that means the old books...Nothing strikes me more when I read the controversies of past ages than the fact that both sides were usually assuming without question a good deal which we should now absolutely deny. They thought that they were as completely opposed as two sides could be, but in fact they were all the time secretly united-united with each other and against earlier and later ages-by a great mass of common assumptions....None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it, and weaken our guard against it, if we read only modern books." --[C.S. Lewis](!Wikipedia)^[his [Introduction](http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/athanasius/incarnation/incarnation.p.htm) to _The Incarnation of the Word of God_]

Maybe there's a different externality. Instead of powering decision-making, or funneling people into science, maybe fiction serves as kind of a global brain - enabling creative thinking and breakthroughs that a more sober society will not.

This thesis reminds me of the [Orson Welles](!Wikipedia) quote from _[The Third Man](!Wikipedia)_ that goes:

> "...in Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace—and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."^[On the other hand, Switzerland is, adjusted for size, one of the [most scientifically prolific](http://mangans.blogspot.com/2009/07/scientific-impact-of-nations.html) countries in the world. [Albert Einstein](!Wikipedia) was a Swiss citizen, incidentally.]

The evidence for this idea might be that every great scientific or technological power was also strong in the humanities, and exceptions like Soviet Russia only prove the rule by creating scientific enclaves mimicking the freer countries.

But of course, this might be confusing correlation with causation. What characterizes those countries is a general freedom of action & thought. Some incline to the arts, some to the sciences. Successes in both domains spring from a common cause, not each other. After all, if the arts could fertilize the sciences, one would expect some reciprocity - and the humanities have made [notoriously little use](!Wikipedia "The Two Cultures")^[And while the situation has gotten better since C.P. Snow's day, can we really say there's so much cross-fertilization as to prove this externality, or prove it of sufficient magnitude?] of science's techniques, worldview, or results.

Conceptually, I see no problem with a nation of sober hard-headed engineers and scientists doing quite as well without the novelists.

If we think of specifics, the idea of cross-fertilization retreats. What Elizabethan plays helped Isaac Newton? When Einstein thought of riding a beam of light, did the novels of Thomas Mann play any role? What hath [Stephen King](!Wikipedia) to do with [Stephen Hawking](!Wikipedia)?

#### Won't someone think of the chemists?

One could worry that the failure of fiction markets to find a sustainable model might mean the end for nonfiction material, which includes texts & research on things precious to us all such as vaccines.

After all, many of the same arguments seem to apply to the flood of nonfiction material. [ProQuest](!Wikipedia)'s database includes 1.023 million PhD theses published in the last 30 years from just 151 American institutions;^[See ["Which universities lead and lag? Toward university rankings based on scholarly output"](http://www.stanford.edu/~dramage/papers/universities-nips10.pdf), Ramage 2010.] and it says [says](http://www.proquest.com/en-US/products/dissertations/) that its full database of PhD and Masters' theses runs to over 2 million, and is increasing at more than 70,000 works a year. Much of this material would seem to be sterile and unproductive, as can be scientific papers in general.^[Various disciplines have many papers and essays arguing that researchers deliberately inflate their paper counts to meet publishing requirements<!-- http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/decline.htm -->, pursue unproductive but publishable avenues, and are so lacking in rigor that many (or even [most](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)) results are wrong - so it would be difficult to offer any citations for such a broad claim. Mencius Moldbug has written a meandering & funny essay/blog post about [what is wrong with the field of computer science](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/whats-wrong-with-cs-research.html), however, that conveys this general vein of thought.]

But this worry is unnecessary. There are several possibilities.

The nonfiction market *could* be subsidized. This is quite justifiable. Science, after all, is heavily subsidized already. Why? Because it has enormous value ^[How much economic growth since the Middle Ages has been due to science & technology, and not solely increased population & resource exploitation? Most of the growth...] and new research can't be replaced by old, almost by definition. There's intrinsic value to populating new chapters and books with new results, value that isn't there with fiction.

The nonfiction market could survive as the fiction market withers away. Fields might lose the subsidy of students forced to buy the latest trivially-changed edition, but that's a predatory subsidy and more valuable to the publishers than the academic authors, so the loss would be minimal.

### Accept no substitutes, or, I can't believe it's not Octavia Butler

The claim of #3 is that we can, without loss, switch everyone over from reading contemporary fiction to not-so-contemporary fiction. I daresay this is the premise everyone will question immediately. The classics are an essential part of an intellectually balanced breakfast, but can they be all of it?

In many respects, much of fiction is worthless. For example, the medieval Japanese believed that _[The Tale of Genji](!Wikipedia)_ was missing several chapters. Suppose this were true? How exactly has the world been harmed? People seem to enjoy _Genji monogatari_ quite well enough. Would the discovery of 3 or 4 concluding chapters *improve* the work? Clearly it would lead to a great deal of work being done, since textbooks and papers would have to be updated, but how likely is it that the extra chapters will make _Genji_ a greater work? _Genji_ isn't the most tightly plotted work. If an act were cut out of _[Macbeth](!Wikipedia)_, it would be a poorer play for it, and many poems would suffer for losing a stanza; but plays and poems are usually written with an eye to performance - there's a premium on length that isn't there with novels. Consider [Charles Dickens](!Wikipedia)'s _[The Pickwick Papers](!Wikipedia)_. If 100 pages dropped right out of the middle, do you think any new readers would notice? Or if a few heroic hexameters dropped out of the _[Iliad](!Wikipedia)_, would our enjoyment be any less? 'Even Homer nods'; it is the entire work that is valuable.

People might *say* that they would derive much less enjoyment from an incomplete, edited, or abridged version, but I don't know how much we can trust such utterances. They might just be making a ritual genuflection to the eminent author, or upholding a social image as a person who cares about accuracy, completeness, and authenticity. If we can't, if there is some ceiling of _n_ utilons of enjoyment which is reached by many books, then premise #3 is saved.

But can we assume that there's a common valuation for how enjoyable all books are? _[Moby Dick](!Wikipedia)_ is quite different from _[The Importance of Being Earnest](!Wikipedia)_. Alice may value the former much less than the latter, while Bob wants a nautical drama & not a comedy of manners. In this case, because both works exist, both Alice & Bob can be satisfied and we reach an optimum.

But what if the book Bob desires hasn't been published, but would be soon if there were a market? He will be saddened to have to read of butlers and harpooners instead of the shadow war of [Pirates versus Ninjas](!Wikipedia). In this binary case, Alice will still be fine, but Bob will be worse off.

The full example is not so bad for us, though. It's plausible that Bob would enjoy _Pirates vs. Ninja: The Stabbening_ more than _Moby Dick_ if those were the only 2 choices. But there are over 32 million books in the [Library of Congress](!Wikipedia); is Bob so extraordinarily picky that not a single existing book would be as or more enjoyable than PvN?

This is not so implausible; American culture stagnated in many ways during the 20th century. The economist [Tyler Cowen](!Wikipedia) [considers](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/08/what-if-culture-froze.html) a reader's thought experiment:

> "...what if the law said we couldn't make any new art (movies, novels, music etc). And perhaps said we ought to rerelease each year the art that first appeared 50 or 30 years ago. How would people's leisure activity and society's cultural evolution change?"

And replies ^[Links as in original.]:

> "After the adjustment process, I believe that matters would settle in an orderly fashion, although whether we pick the art from 30 or 50 years ago would make a big difference in terms of the required rejiggling of our aesthetic sensibilities.  We would pick out [bestsellers from 30 or 50 years ago](http://greatpenformances.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/1959-bestselling-novels/) and some of them would be in demand, if only because people wish to share common cultural experiences.  Overall it is the more obscure books from that era that would likely rise to be the bestsellers today.\
> 1979 is barely an aesthetic leap; could not _The Clash_ be a hit today?  How about Madonna?  Is it so ridiculous to think that people still might go hear _The Rolling Stones_ or Paul McCartney in concert?"

In the same vein, [John Taylor](!Wikipedia "John Taylor (bass guitarist)") ([bassist](!Wikipedia) for _[Duran Duran](!Wikipedia)_), who is unhappy with the "slow down"^[He is not the only one diagnosing this slowdown; see composer [Glenn Branca](!Wikipedia)'s ["The Score: The End of Music"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/the-end-of-music/) for another lament.] of "innovative culture" (and music in particular), admits that:

> "Most students I know have an extremely broad appreciation of music....
> My stepson is at New York University (NYU) and he was telling me how he's currently into Cole Porter, music from the 1920s and swing music from the 40s. So the availability and accessibility of music on the internet today is truly incredible, and I applaud anything that can inspire interest or curiosity in anyone.\
> But this also means that those of us who before would have been looking towards the current culture for inspiration are now often to be found, like my stepson, in various backwaters of older music.\
> This relative lack of need for current, innovative culture can cause, has caused, is causing - maybe - the innovative culture to slow down, much as an assembly line in Detroit slows down and lay-offs have to be made when the demand for a new model recedes."^[["Is the internet stifling new music?"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8347178.stm), 9 November 2009, _BBC News_]

Pejorative language aside ([Cole Porter](!Wikipedia) is a backwater?), does Taylor's grandson sound unhappy with old music? Would he be unhappy if his choices were universalized and less new music were created as a result?

#### In-progress works

But, you say, [Herbert](!Wikipedia "Frank Herbert") & Wolfe are fine, but dammit you have a hunger for some [Cory Doctorow](!Wikipedia), and can't help but be curious as to how the deuce _The Wheel of Time_ will end. OK, fine. There are ~300 million Americans who couldn't care less if a market dissolution balked you. And of course, the problem of works-in-progress is a problem that solves itself: Doctorow must one day die, and if he shuffles off the mortal coil tomorrow, then your situation was the same as mine - except with a slightly higher upper bound.

And even if you were balked, or in-progress series permitted to finish, that's a fixed one-time cost^[One-time, of course. It's hard to imagine what an on-going cost for in-progress works might be. People dreaming up possible series and being unhappy that they won't be written? But we hardly are concerned by ['ten thousand freaks that died in thinking'](!Wikipedia "Absalom and Achitophel").]. It may cost quite a bit to liquidate all the companies and shift their assets into more productive occupations; some people will never shift. But that's [creative destruction](!Wikipedia) for you: the long-term benefits win in the long run.

#### New book smell

Maybe there's something intrinsically better about new books. Not that they deal with new subjects - we addressed that earlier - but perhaps it's about the style, or appearance, or apparent novelty. Maybe when one looks at _[Tom Jones](!Wikipedia "The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling")_, the antique language instantly subtracts 10 utilons even if it's still comprehensible.

But the language can't be the reason. Maybe Shakespeare and Chaucer aren't as enjoyable and this explains why they aren't as popular as they should be given their eminence, but for this to explain why books from the '50s or '60s are very unpopular or why books from the '00s sell better than books from the '90s - despite them all reading much the same[^language], we need to posit large penalties and attribute to readers remarkable powers of discrimination.

If there is a new book smell, and it can explain why books from the recent past are less popular than new book, then that means it is nothing intrinsic about the books themselves. Which suggests that it's a matter of consumer perception; marketing has a long history of altering consumer perceptions for fun & profit.

If new books ceased to be written, then the publishers of the existing books will have to compete on other grounds, such as price and marketing - which would include faking new book smell. If people are so frequently mistaken about what they would enjoy most now, surely they can be mistaken in the future about new book smell. The modern success of Jane Austen and of lightly edited versions such as _[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies](!Wikipedia)_ demonstrates that the centuries need be no bar.

# At the end of the day

> "There is nothing so absurd but that some philosopher has said it." --[Cicero](!Wikipedia)^[_De Divinatione_, bk. 2, sct. 58]

> "The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, & to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it." --[Bertrand Russell](!Wikipedia)^["The Philosophy of [Logical Atomism](!Wikipedia)"]

> "But I had become aware, even so early as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and incredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on of the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I remarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours are not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary that many of these nations make an equally good, if not better, use of their reason than we do." --[René Descartes](!Wikisource "Discourse on the Method/Part 2")

We've covered quite a bit of ground here. There are a number of different theses I've tried to argue for here:

- There's more fiction then anyone could hope to consume
- People would be happier reading only the best fiction
- It's easier to figure out what the good old fiction is, than it is new fiction
    - there's also more good old fiction than good new fiction
- people write too much new fiction
    - they also read too much
- Society shouldn't subsidize economically inefficient things like new fiction
    -  We might go so far as to suggest a [Pigovian tax](!Wikipedia) on new works because they encourage their own consumption
- The uses of fiction are much less than one might think, and many of those uses are propagandistic, dangerous, or both
- Subsidizing the nonfiction market may be justifiable

I've hope you've been convinced of at least 2 or 3 of these theses. I rather want to reject the idea that new works should be discouraged, but the only class of objections that can hold any water is the non-substitutability one, and I don't see any solid arguments there.

People *are* better off reading the best books, and the best ones are predominately the ones that already exist, there're more than can be read, and new books have no compelling advantage over the classics. The economics place me against new fiction. And when I remember how people are beguiled by new fiction into reading crap, I find myself placed against new fiction on esthetic grounds as well.

I have started with common-sense grounds and wound up somewhere strange.

# draft

Hm. I've thought a little more about it, and I think it might be
possible to get something of value out of this argument: with a
different emphasis, we can see it as a _reductio_ against either the
idea that esthetic experiences (of art) can be compared or reckoned at
all with each other, or the idea that art can have
eternal/undiminished esthetic value.

The reductio would go:
- Given a certain set of empirical circumstances, the collection of
art available to any human will grow, and keep on growing as artists
explore ever new mediums and genres and 'mash up' old works - the
Library of Congress never shrinks.
- Given that we won't assume that artistic competence will enter an
eternal decline, we can expect the # of works above some absolute
level of quality will likewise always grow (ie. as time passes, the #
of works greater than Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew_ will
only increase)
- Given also that a human's
lifespan/capacity-to-experience-aesthetic-experiences is fixed
- we can conclude that: no matter how high a human's standard, there
will be a point in history where enough art has been produced that he
can spend his *entire* life consuming *only* works above that standard
- at which point, the value of new art drops to zero for him, and per
my economic arguments, even have negative values

But it seems absurd that we could ever, under any circumstances,
prefer less art to more art, or even only be indifferent between a
large collection and a larger (it oughtn't be true that a Library of
Congress with 10 billion works == a LoC with 20 billion works). So we
might conclude that there is something wrong here.

If we reject the idea that art is eternal in value, then the
resolution is obvious: the value of the LoC decays over time, and it
needs to be topped up with fresh masterpieces.

-----


Hm. My first reaction is to say, it doesn't matter. After all, while
we may not be able to put artworks into neat countable categories,
there is something we *can* count and which is absolutely crucial to
the argument: time. Our lives are only so long, and they are
denominated quite precisely, nanosecond by nanosecond. We only live
50,000 hours, I think the approximation goes. Does it matter whether
it's a ballet or a novel if we spend 1 of those hours interacting with
or collaborating with it? The art's 'essence' or 'artiness' may be as
non-commodified as we please, but we can't get around the limits on
ourselves. For our finite lives, it's good enough if we call it art.

[^scratch]: I suspect, as does author [Charles Stross](!Wikipedia) (["Why the commercial ebook market is broken"](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/03/why_the_commercial_ebook_marke.html)), that book publishers and Amazon are taking a considerable percentage of the ebook revenue, since in this _[New Yorker](!Wikipedia)_ article, Amazon expected a newspaper publisher to agree to give Amazon 70% of the subscription fees; Amazon has monopoly control over the Kindle, and it is reasonable to think that they are similarly demanding of book publishers. From ["Priced to Sell: Is Free the Future?"](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/07/06/090706crbo_books_gladwell), 6 July 2009, by [Malcolm Gladwell](!Wikipedia):

    > "At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, James Moroney, the publisher of the [Dallas Morning News](!Wikipedia), told Congress about negotiations he’d just had with the online retailer Amazon. The idea was to license his newspaper’s content to the Kindle, Amazon’s new electronic reader. “They want seventy per cent of the subscription revenue,” Moroney testified. “I get thirty per cent, they get seventy per cent. On top of that, they have said we get the right to republish your intellectual property to any portable device.”\
    > The idea was that if a Kindle subscription to the Dallas Morning News cost ten dollars a month, seven dollars of that belonged to Amazon, the provider of the gadget on which the news was read, and just three dollars belonged to the newspaper, the provider of an expensive and ever-changing variety of editorial content. The people at Amazon valued the newspaper’s contribution so little, in fact, that they felt they ought then to be able to license it to anyone else they wanted."

    _[Slate Magazine](!Wikipedia)_ [article](http://www.slate.com/id/2230821/) takes the opposite view: that Amazon is *losing* a great deal of money on each ebook:

     > "...Amazon pays the same wholesale price for Kindle books as it does for real books—generally 50 percent of the list price. For a typical hardback that retails for $26—say, E.L. Doctorow's _Homer & Langley_—Amazon pays $13 and then sells it for $9.99 on the Kindle, taking a $3 loss on each sale. (The longer-term strategy, publishers fear, is that once the Kindle gains significant market share, Amazon will negotiate lower wholesale prices for digital versions.)"
[^subsidy]: I'm using 'subsidy' in a broad sense. Intellectual property laws are subsidies; stronger IP law or more vigorous enforcement is more government subsidy of the protected _[rentiers](!Wikipedia "rentier")_; universities hiring professors of creative writing or English and enabling them to write their books on sabbaticals or summer vacations, and publishing them at or below cost - those are subsidies as well. Tax breaks are subsidies, etc.
[^rate]: A rate which, if surveys are to be believed, puts me in a quite rarefied percentile; eg ["One in Four Read No Books Last Year"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101045.html) (_[The Washington Post](!Wikipedia)_), and mentions the average for Americans was 4 books a year, and the median among those who read at least one book was 7, roughly 1 every 7 weeks.
[^wot]: And the reason I was reading _Mistborn_ at all was curiosity as to how his _The Wheel of Time_ novels might go - WoT being an excellent example of a mediocre work that sucked time that could've gone to something better.
[^just]: Just prices are easy to set for necessities - eg. if anybody is starving to death, then the price of food is not at the just price - but this doesn't work for luxuries. And most of Amazon's merchandise must be classified as a luxury. One is not going to die without the latest _[Madden NFL](!Wikipedia)_ video game or [James Patterson](!Wikipedia) novel.
[^propaganda]: A loaded word, I admit. But fiction is fundamentally lies - stories about things that never were and never will be - and 'convincing someone to do something they wouldn't've based on lies or rhetoric for some ulterior purpose' is as good a definition of 'propaganda' as I can think of.
[^language]: From the distance of centuries, everything written in the 1600s sounds equally 1600-ish. But there is more intra-group variation in the books of the '50s and '90s then there is inter-group variation. A book from the 1950s can easily date itself, but it'll be usually through allusions and ideologies, and not the actual words.
[^geo]: America, and Great Britain. France contributed a little to SF with [Jules Verne](!Wikipedia), and Japan's SF is copious (but uninfluential). Besides that, further sources of SF can be named on one hand. Poland offers us [Stanislaw Lem](!Wikipedia), Russia has... someone, no doubt. And that's about it. SF isn't prolific even in the Anglophone First World, much less the rest of the globe.
[^hanson]: [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia) has a number of good articles on how fiction can very easily mislead us, and that this may be a fundamental fact about the human brain (the 'Near/Far' psychology paradigm):
     - ["Biases of Science Fiction"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/12/biases_of_scien.html)
     - ["What Insight Literature?"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/what-insight-li.html)
     - ["Disagreement is Near-Far Bias"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/disagreement-is-nearfar-bias.html)
     - ["Beware Detached Detail"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/beware-detached-detail.html)
     - ["BSG is Detached Detail"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/bsg-is-detached-detail.html)
     - ["Against Propaganda"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/against-propaganda-.html)
[^sequels]: By a rough count of [Nebula Award for Best Novel](!Wikipedia), 14 of the 43 winners were part of some franchise or series of works. To account for Hugos, we double that to 28 for the 2 awards; if each is part of a trilogy, we need to add 84 more works to our reading list, for another 2 years.
[^sleepdealer]: To take an obscure recent example; ["_Sleep Dealer_ Injects Sci-Fi Into Immigration Debate"](http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2008/01/sleep_dealer), [_Wired_](!Wikipedia "Wired (magazine)"), 24 January 2008:

     > "_Sleep Dealer_ is remarkably topical for a film set in the future (albeit one described by Rivera as taking place "five minutes from now"). Central themes include outsourcing, corporate ownership of water, remote warfare, confessional internet diaries and military contractors who are accountable to no one. It's the rare political film without any reference to contemporary politics; like _Blade Runner_ and other big-brained sci-fi flicks, it's about ideas, not selling merchandise.
     > "I love gnomes and goblins and elves," said Rivera, who's made a name for himself touring museums and festivals with his award-winning shorts. "But what I'm really interested in is speculative fiction. I wanted to use this film to ask the question, 'Where are we going?'"
     > ...
     > That ironic juxtaposition started Rivera thinking: What if technology could extract the life force from the Mexican population and send it north?"
[^printing]: Surprisingly, the cost of printing a first edition of a book is only about [10](http://blog.laptopmag.com/ebook-price-war)[%](http://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/?p=2138) of the publisher's final wholesale price, and shipping isn't much more. The money is going into [other](http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2010/01/31/why-my-books-are-no-longer-for-sale-via-amazon/) [things](http://yuki-onna.livejournal.com/563086.html)
