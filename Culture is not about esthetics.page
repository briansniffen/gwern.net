> "The climate of our culture is changing. Under these new rains, new suns, small things grow great, and what was great grows small; whole species disappear and are replaced." --[Randall Jarrell](!Wikipedia)^["A Sad Heart at the Supermarket", _Daedalus_, vol. 89, no. 2 (Spring 1960)]

The [Amazon Kindle](!Wikipedia) has ignited the [ebook](!Wikipedia) market by providing a [e-ink](!Wikipedia) interface which is visually competitive with paper, and easy access to a remarkable fraction of Amazon's inventory. It's very nice.

The pricing of the ebooks has caused some controversy; why should an ebook cost as much as $3/4$ or more than the book? The Kindle's ebooks are just small files being downloaded over a cellular network, as opposed to a multi-pound slab of exactingly manufactured wood and cloth. The former is created and delivered instantly, while the latter requires elaborate factories and transport to get into the reader's hands. Surely there is vast overhead for the paper, and the ebook's prices should reflect the fact that once created, the marginal cost of another copy is close to 0¢.

Not many expect ebooks to be priced in cents, since the author expects to be paid a fair bit for her writing, and the publisher expects to be paid for editing & formatting it, and Amazon is there discreetly coughing for its (substantial) share of the transactions[^scratch]. So it won't be 0¢, but why not $3 or less?

# The price is not right

In a sense, this is a [very easy](!Wikipedia "Law of supply and demand") question. The right price for ebooks is whatever the market will bear. If $3 is not the right price, then consumers will not buy, and the price will continue to fall until they do.

In another sense, it's a difficult question as some people seem to be thinking in medieval terms, of the '[just price](!Wikipedia)', which has no objective meaning & so cannot be definitively set[^just].

## Subsidies

The more interesting question is, is there a price level mutually acceptable to consumers & sellers of books which permit the latter to survive in their current corporate forms? If there isn't, *should* the latter survive? That is: if books are not economically sustainable at prices below $3, say, will society be worse off? Should publishers or novelists be subsidized[^subsidy]?

The more I think about it, the harder I find justifying any subsidy.

We value high author royalties because this allows authors to specialize in being authors; specialization is a good thing because it allows authors to produce more than they otherwise would; and higher production is good because we value the fruits thereof.

But higher production isn't always good; production can be misguided or wasted ^[cf. [broken window fallacy](!Wikipedia)].

# 100 apples in the barrel

> "Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,\
> For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain." --William Shakespeare^[[_King Richard II_](!Wikipedia "Richard II (play)")]  

Here's an analogy. Suppose we all have 100 apples. Our lives do not revolve around apples, though we like them well enough. But still, 100 is too many; even if we ate 5 a day, the rest would go bad before we ate them. And of course, it's unlikely that any of us will go to the greengrocers and buy *more*. The [marginal utility](!Wikipedia) of apples for us have plunged to zero^[Or below; I dislike clutter.].

From our perspective, the farmer bringing a truck of apples to the greengrocers has wasted his labor. Let's hope he'll find *something* to do with those surplus apples so the resources that went into making them were not wasted - maybe bake some apple pies, or compost them all.

Now suppose this wasn't a one-time gift. We live in a magic world where everyone gets 100 apples a week. Now it isn't one trip that was useless, it's the farmer's entire career. Isn't he wasting his life? He's a smart fellow - no reason he couldn't go do something more useful.

Sure, we can invent ways to employ this farmer. Perhaps every week he breaks into everybody's kitchens and steals their apples so they have to buy apples from him. Perhaps he'll run a large marketing campaign to convince everyone that his apples are somehow superior to the magical apples. Perhaps some people get [Granny Smith](!Wikipedia)s but really wanted [Red Delicious](!Wikipedia)es, and he makes himself an apple-trading hub, filling in deficits with apples he grows. Perhaps he lives on government subsidy checks & farms apples as a hobby. Or something.

But nevertheless, these apple-farmers represent a [dead-weight loss](!Wikipedia). That's bad.

# 100 books on the shelf

> "Do technology and economic growth create problems? Certainly. But as Maurice Chevalier said about the disadvantages of growing old, consider the alternative.\
> I will hedge my optimism when it comes to the arts, but only marginally. It is hard to make a case that the literature, art, and music of today come close to the best work of earlier ages, let alone signify progress. On the other hand, if you chose to live in Renaissance Florence you would not be able to enjoy [Cézanne](!Wikipedia) and [Picasso](!Wikipedia). In [Johnson](!Wikipedia "Samuel Johnson")'s London, you would not be able to listen to Beethoven or Brahms. In _La [Belle Époque](!Wikipedia)_, you would not be able to read [Joyce](!Wikipedia "James Joyce") or [Faulkner](!Wikipedia "William Faulkner"). To live in today's world is not only to have access to all the best that has come before, but also to have a breadth and ease of access that is comparably greater than that enjoyed even by our parents, let alone earlier generations." --[Charles Murray](!Wikipedia "Charles Murray (author)"), _[Human Accomplishment](!Wikipedia)_

Now, can we apply this analogy? I don't have 100 apples, but perhaps I have - 100 novels.

Not random novels, but [science fiction](!Wikipedia) novels. And not just any 100 Sci-Fi novels, but the elite, the select, the critically acclaimed winners of the 2 most prestigious SF awards for the last 50 years^[I realize that double-winners mean the equation isn't simply $2 \times 50$, but close enough.]: the [Hugo](!Wikipedia "Hugo Award") and [Nebula Award](!Wikipedia)s.

## Reading them


> "Time destroys the groundless conceits of men; it confirms decisions founded on reality." --[Cicero](!Wikipedia)^[_De Natura Deorum_, Bk II.2]

Suppose I read industriously at the rate of 1 a week[^rate], or 52 a year. I will finish this 100 in ~2 years.

Think about that. 2 years. It will take an appreciable fraction of my life just to read a vanishingly small fraction of one small fiction genre, that itself has existed for less than 2 centuries and been written almost exclusively in 2 countries[^geo].

And what if I want to read the prequels and sequels? Not all winners are as prolific in sequels & prequels as _[Dune](!Wikipedia "Dune universe")_, but these winners include many duologies and trilogies (or more)[^sequels]. I can probably expect to lose another 2 or 6 years to them. Certainly, I can expect it to take another 4 years to read the 2 top runner-ups for each award. And did I mention that these awards have multiple categories? Many of SF's greatest works are short stories or novellas, which compete for different Nebula & Hugo awards.

And of course, it's not like the Hugo & Nebula awards are the definitive list of SF 'books to read' - _[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction](!Wikipedia)_ treats of hundreds of writers, and mentions thousands of works; _[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy](!Wikipedia)_ has >4000 entries. Like a fractal coast, my reading list becomes longer the more thoroughly I search...

## New = bad

> "It is worth serious consideration how great an amount of time -- their own and other people's -- and of paper is wasted by this swarm of mediocre poets, and how injurious their influence is. For the public always seizes on what is new, and shows even more inclination to what is perverse and dull, as being akin to its own nature. These works of the mediocre, therefore, draw the public away and hold it back from genuine masterpieces, and from the education they afford. Thus they work directly against the benign influence of genius, ruin taste more and more, and so arrest the progress of the age." --[Arthur Schopenhauer](!Wikipedia)^[_[The World as Will and Representation](!Wikipedia)_, section 51, footnote 41]

So I'm a decade into my SF reading quest; if the SF industry had imploded the day I started, I still will neither know nor care.

I would be better off, actually, if the industry *did* implode! The last SF or Fantasy I read was [Brandon Sanderson](!Wikipedia)'s _[Mistborn](!Wikipedia "Mistborn series")_ trilogy. It was pretty good, but I know I could've done much better. My reading time is finite, and reading _Mistborn_ pushed out reading [Gene Wolfe](!Wikipedia)'s _[Book of the Long Sun](!Wikipedia)_ tetralogy - which I ultimately enjoyed more. If the industry had imploded before _Mistborn_ was published, I would've read _Long Sun_ instead.

(The connection to other aspects of modern life and _[akrasia](!Wikipedia)_ is apparent: there's a [Gresham's Law](!Wikipedia) whereby cheap yet unsatisfying works will push out more satisfying but more demanding entertainment.)

It wouldn't be difficult to spend the rest of my life reading only SF published before 2009, and it would be more efficient as time is better than I at winnowing the good from the bad.

### Generalizing this

But only reading SF is impoverishing. I always wanted to get into mysteries and French literature. But there go another 2 decades, at least. Now I'm in my 50s. I'd better get cracking if I ever want to go through English literature or Asian, or maybe any nonfiction!

So, why do I care what happens to the SF market? How does it concern me that the short story magazines (which incubate new writers) are collapsing? I have no need for them. I already have 100 apples.

### Music

Or how about music? Just the genre of classical music. I once downloaded a complete collection of [J.S. Bach](!Wikipedia) which came to 17 gigabytes. I've no idea how many hours of music that is, and am too frightened to calculate it. And how many listens would it take to reasonably appreciate it? A lifetime, perhaps. Why should I care about some publisher trying to record another CD of the [Brandenburg Concertos](!Wikipedia)? I'm not a conductor, I will hear no improvement. To me, there is no difference between the world's greatest violinist and the 10^th^-greatest.

### Movies

Or consider another medium: movies. Have you seen even a fraction of the [IMDB](!Wikipedia "Internet Movie Database")'s [Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top)? There are some pretty incredible movies in there. Some of them are profound, others moving, and not a few profoundly moving. Why are you going to watch _[Transformers 2](!Wikipedia "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen")_ or _[Ice Age 3](!Wikipedia "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs")_? For entertainment value? But there are movies in that list which are far more entertaining, I assure you.

Even if you've seen the top 50, there's another 200 to choose from. (As before, at 1 or 2 a week, there's years worth there.) If you think the IMDB is too faddish and Internet-centric, there's no shortage of other lists - the _New York Times_ would be happy to tell you all about ["The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made"](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html) (20 years), for example. And what about television?

### Genres in general

Basically, any field over a century old has built up a sufficient stock of masterpieces for these arguments to work.

Fields that are new, or still technically developing, may be able to evade these arguments. For example, video games - even the greatest arcade games from 20 or 30 years ago have a hard time competing against even average games from within the past few years.

But even new genres have problems with this argument. After all, while we may not be able to put artworks into neat countable categories of 'painting' or 'Russian novel', there is something we *can* count and which is absolutely crucial to the argument: time. Our lives are only so long, and they are denominated quite precisely, nanosecond by nanosecond. We only live 500,000 waking hours^[$\text{total hours} - \text{sleeping hours}$, or, $80 \text{years} \times 365 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 700800$; $700800 - (\frac{1}{3} \times 700800) = 467200$].

Does it matter whether it's a ballet or a novel if we spend 1 of those hours interacting with or collaborating with it? The art's 'essence' or 'artness' may be as non-commodified as we please, but we can't get around the limits on ourselves. For our finite lives, it's good enough if we call it art. And we don't necessarily need to assume substitution of works *across* genres; given enough time, any genre you please will outrun your lifespan.

## Media shock

> "The soul has no assignments, neither cooks\
> Nor referees: it wastes its time. It wastes its time.\
> Here in this enclave there are centuries\
> For you to waste...
> The books, just leafed through, whisper endlessly." --Randal Jarrell^["A Girl in a Library", lines 32-29; _The Seven-League Crutches_]

I hope I've made my point: we live in an age of *profound* media abundance. Like none before us, we can partake of the greatest works in all mediums of all ages. We do not sip from a water fountain laboriously supplied by hard-working artists & authors, nor even guzzle from a fire-hose hooked up to a printing press; we are being shot off [Victoria Falls](!Wikipedia). The impact alone will kill us.

# Let's ban new books

> "Consequently, it is soon recognised that they write for the sake of filling up the paper, and this is the case sometimes with the best authors... As soon as this is perceived the book should be thrown away, for time is precious. As a matter of fact, the author is cheating the reader as soon as he writes for the sake of filling up paper; because his pretext for writing is that he has something to impart. Writing for money and preservation of copyright are, at bottom, the ruin of literature. It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth writing. What an inestimable advantage it would be, if, in every branch of literature, there existed only a few but excellent books!" --Arthur Schopenhauer, ["On Authorship and Style"](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/essays/chapter3.html)

With our too too short lives, and so much to see, one does oneself a great disservice by consuming anything but the best.

And thus, do not authors & artists do us a disservice by creating mediocrity we, being only human, will at least try? Maybe these authors & artists are only creating [attractive nuisance](!Wikipedia)s!

Let's look back on the argument:

1. Society ought to *discourage economically* inefficient activities.\
    At least, it *ought not to encourage* inefficiency. It may not do this perfectly, but this is still a desiderata; special pleading for some activity, saying that some other activity or market is far more economically inefficient, is not good enough. (Children know this; 'just because someone else does it doesn't make it right for you'.)
2. If some good _a_ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing & available good _b_ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to produce _a_ and not use _b_.
3. Consumers of new novels would be equally satisfied by existing novels.
4. By 2 & 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new novels.

∴ By 1 & 4: Society ought to discourage new novels

In short: old stuff is as good as the new, and it's cheaper; so making new stuff is wasteful.

## Objections

One of the basic tactics with any objectionable argument is to see whether any of the inference steps are faulty. In this case, we can see that there is nothing wrong with the logic. So we're left with rejecting premises, or accepting the conclusion.

Here's what we can reject:

1. that societies ought to encourage efficiency
2. that creating something when there's an existing object is inefficient
3. that old books can replace new ones.

### Society doesn't care?

Now, #1 seems unobjectionable. To reject that premise is to argue either that society ought to discourage economic efficiency, or be neutral about efficiency.

The former is obviously crazy. There are governmental programs and policies whose proponents acknowledge that they are economically inefficient, but they agree that their inefficiency is a flaw, and the programs are justifiable not because of, but despite the inefficiency - they supposedly deliver some other benefit which compensates for the cost.

The latter is not so obviously crazy. But voters consistently elect candidates who promise to grow the economy & make things better; and governments have a long history of supporting projects - like bridges & highways - whose justifications are that government ought to help make the economy more efficient.

So if you want to reject the whole argument because you dislike premise #1, you are either ignoring sanity or you're ignoring history.

### What's efficiency anyway?

Premise #2 is weaker. To me, this premise about substitutability seems so obvious that I'm not sure how to defend it. If you need a glove, and you have a perfectly good one already, isn't spending $20 on a new glove the same thing as throwing your money away? Isn't #2 just a generalization of this obvious fact?

If you reject #2, I'm not really sure what economics you're working under. But there are a few objections we could classify under this heading, generally postulating [externalities](!Wikipedia), such as Keynesian thinking about stimulus spending.

#### They Snatched Society's Brain!

An interlocutor might suggest that perhaps the creation & consumption of new fiction[^nomenclature] or novels serves some laudable purpose beyond swelling libraries.

Now, what good deeds could only *new* works produce? Certainly it's not edifying & educating our youth; given the rise of relativisms of all kind in the 20th century and looser standards of decency, new works arguably would be detrimental in this regard.

Ah, new fiction could be an important societal mechanism for discussing new developments and for pondering the future. SF would be an excellent example of this. Who but knows that the constant undercurrent of computers & cloning & space travel in SF has not helped society prepare for the future? Hasn't SF directly inspired any number of young men & women to enter the hard sciences (as opposed to dedicating their talents to, say, finance), with benefits redounding to all humanity? What's a dead-weight loss of a few hundred million or billion a year compared with landing on the Moon?

I find this argument uncomfortable. It's arguing that fiction is justified inasmuch as it makes superior propaganda[^propaganda]. It may be propaganda in the service of a noble & good cause, and swaying someone to choose a career in science is not as objectionable as propagandizing children into clearing Iraqi minefields with their bodies - but the morality of it is difficult.

And a utilitarian might cavil about the benefits. Fiction can be unfairly persuasive, bypassing our rational faculties[^hanson]. (SF is often good inversely proportional to how much scientific truth it contains.) The author's motive may be malign as easily as benign.

As a society, is it *good* to have our discussions and views about incredibly important matters like space exploration hijacked by fiction? It's hard to see why fiction would yield discussion of equal or superior quality to discussions based on non-fiction. [Fictional evidence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/) is particularly unpleasant. Consider discussions of [Artificial Intelligence](!Wikipedia); if one sees any mention of fictional entities like [HAL 9000](!Wikipedia) or [Skynet](!Wikipedia "Skynet (Terminator)"), one can stop reading immediately, for the exchange is surely worthless. A discussion about the nonfictional entities [SHRDLU](!Wikipedia) or [Eurisko](!Wikipedia) might be halfway sensible.

So either fiction is effective as propaganda and setting societal agendas, or it isn't. If the latter, then the loss is trivial; if the former, then fiction is dangerous!

#### Two sides of the same organ

> "Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And that means the old books. All contemporary writers share to some extent the contemporary outlook-even those, like myself, who seem most opposed to it. Nothing strikes me more when I read the controversies of past ages than the fact that both sides were usually assuming without question a good deal which we should now absolutely deny. They thought that they were as completely opposed as two sides could be, but in fact they were all the time secretly united-united with each other and against earlier and later ages-by a great mass of common assumptions....None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it, and weaken our guard against it, if we read only modern books. Where they are true they will give us truths which we half knew already. Where they are false they will aggravate the error with which we are already dangerously ill. The only palliative is to keep the clean sea breeze of the centuries blowing through our minds, and this can be done only by reading old books." --[C.S. Lewis](!Wikipedia)^[his [Introduction](http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/athanasius/incarnation/incarnation.p.htm) to _The Incarnation of the Word of God_]

Maybe there's a different externality. Instead of powering decision-making, or funneling people into science, maybe fiction serves as kind of a right brain to society - indirectly enabling creative thinking and breakthroughs that a more sober society will not.

This thesis reminds me of the [Orson Welles](!Wikipedia) quote from _[The Third Man](!Wikipedia)_ that goes:

> "You know what the fellow said—in Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace—and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."^[On the other hand, Switzerland is, adjusted for size, one of the [most scientifically prolific](http://mangans.blogspot.com/2009/07/scientific-impact-of-nations.html) countries in the world. [Albert Einstein](!Wikipedia) was a Swiss citizen, incidentally.]

The evidence for this 'right brain' idea might be that every country the interlocutor can think of which was a great scientific or technological power was also strong in the humanities (exceptions like Soviet Russia proving the rule by setting up scientific enclaves mimicking the freer countries).

But of course, this might be confusing [correlation](!Wikipedia) with causation. What characterizes those countries is a general freedom of action & thought. Some incline to the arts, some to the sciences. Successes in both domains spring from a common cause, not each other. After all, if the arts could fertilize the sciences, one would expect some reciprocity - and the humanities have made [notoriously little use](!Wikipedia "The Two Cultures")^[And while the situation has gotten better since C.P. Snow's day, can we really say there's so much cross-fertilization as to prove this externality, or prove it of sufficient magnitude?] of science's techniques, worldview, or results.

Conceptually, I see no problem with a nation of sober hard-headed engineers and scientists doing quite as well without the novelists.

If we think of specifics, the idea of cross-fertilization retreats. What Elizabethan plays helped Isaac Newton? When Einstein thought of riding a beam of light, did the novels of Thomas Mann play any role? What hath [Stephen King](!Wikipedia) to do with [Stephen Hawking](!Wikipedia)?

#### Won't someone think of the chemists?

One could worry that the failure of fiction markets to find a sustainable model might mean the end for nonfiction material, which includes texts & research on things precious to us all such as heart surgery.

But this worry is unnecessary. There are several possibilities.

The nonfiction market *could* be subsidized. This is quite justifiable. Science, after all, is heavily subsidized already. Why? Because it has enormous value ^[How much economic growth since the Middle Ages has been due to science & technology, and not just increased population & resource exploitation? Most...] and new research can't be replaced by old, almost by definition. There's intrinsic value to populating new chapters and books with results, value that isn't there with fiction.

The nonfiction market could survive as the fiction market withers away. Fields with largely unchanging textbooks might well lose the subsidy of students forced to buy the latest edition, but that's a rather predatory subsidy and probably much more valuable to the publishers than the authors, so the loss would be minimal.

### Accept no substitutes, or, I can't believe it's not Octavia Butler

The claim of #3 is that we can, without loss, switch everyone over from reading contemporary fiction to not-so-contemporary fiction. I daresay this is the premise everyone will question immediately. The classics are an essential part of an intellectually balanced breakfast, but can they be all of it?

In many respects, much of fiction is worthless. For example, the medieval Japanese believed that _[The Tale of Genji](!Wikipedia)_ was missing several chapters. Suppose this were true? How exactly has the world been harmed? People seem to enjoy _Genji monogatari_ quite well enough. Would the discovery of 3 or 4 concluding chapters *improve* the world? Clearly it would lead to a great deal of work being done, since all sorts of textbooks and papers would have to be updated, but how likely is it that the extra chapters will make _Genji_ a greater work? _Genji_ isn't the most tightly plotted work. If an act were cut out of _[Macbeth](!Wikipedia)_, it would be a poorer play for it, and many poems would suffer for losing a stanza; but plays and poems are usually written with an eye to performance - there's a premium on length that isn't there with novels. Consider [Charles Dickens](!Wikipedia)'s _[The Pickwick Papers](!Wikipedia)_. If 100 pages dropped right out of the middle, do you think any new readers would notice? Or if a few heroic hexameters dropped out of the _[Iliad](!Wikipedia)_, would our enjoyment be any less? ('Even Homer nods.')

People might *say* that they would derive much less enjoyment from an incomplete, edited, or abridged version, but I don't know how much we can trust such utterances. They might just be making a ritual genuflection to the eminent author, or upholding a social image as a person who cares about accuracy, completeness, and authenticity. If we can't, if there is some ceiling of _n_ utilons of enjoyment which is reached by many books, then premise #3 is saved.

But can we assume that there's a common valuation for how enjoyable all books are? _[Moby Dick](!Wikipedia)_ is quite different from _[The Importance of Being Earnest](!Wikipedia)_. Alice may value the former much less than the latter, while Bob wants a nautical drama & not a comedy of manners. In this case, because both works exist, both Alice & Bob can be satisfied and we reach an optimum.

But what if the book Bob desires hasn't been published, but would be soon were there a market? He will be saddened to have to read of butlers and harpooners instead of the shadow war of [Pirates versus Ninjas](!Wikipedia). In this binary case, Alice will still be fine, but Bob will be worse off.

The full example is not so bad for us, though. It's plausible that Bob would enjoy _Pirates vs. Ninja: The Stabbening_ more than _Moby Dick_. But there are over 32 million books in the [Library of Congress](!Wikipedia); is Bob so extraordinarily picky that not a single existing book would be as or more enjoyable than PvN?

(And for once, cognitive biases work in our favor: people can't be distressed by the works never created; they aren't by uncreated jobs or pleased by prevented disasters.)

This is not so implausible; American culture stagnated in many ways during the 20th century. The economist [Tyler Cowen](!Wikipedia) [considers](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/08/what-if-culture-froze.html) a reader's thought experiment:

> "...what if the law said we couldn't make any new art (movies, novels, music etc). And perhaps said we ought to rerelease each year the art that first appeared 50 or 30 years ago. How would people's leisure activity and society's cultural evolution change?"

And replies [links as in original]:

> "After the adjustment process, I believe that matters would settle in an orderly fashion, although whether we pick the art from 30 or 50 years ago would make a big difference in terms of the required rejiggling of our aesthetic sensibilities.  We would pick out [bestsellers from 30 or 50 years ago](http://greatpenformances.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/1959-bestselling-novels/) and some of them would be in demand, if only because people wish to share common cultural experiences.  Overall it is the more obscure books from that era that would likely rise to be the bestsellers today.\
> 1979 is barely an aesthetic leap; could not _The Clash_ be a hit today?  How about Madonna?  Is it so ridiculous to think that people still might go hear _The Rolling Stones_ or Paul McCartney in concert?  How about buying a Stephen King book?"

In the same vein, [John Taylor](!Wikipedia "John Taylor (bass guitarist)") ([bassist](!Wikipedia) for _[Duran Duran](!Wikipedia)_), who is unhappy with the "slow down"^[He is not the only one diagnosing this slowdown; see composer [Glenn Branca](!Wikipedia)'s ["The Score: The End of Music"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/the-end-of-music/) for another lament.] of "innovative culture" (and music in particular), admits that:

> "Most students I know have an extremely broad appreciation of music. Far broader than I did. Obviously classic rock is very popular, but so too are all sorts of vintage and world music.\
> My stepson is at New York University (NYU) and he was telling me how he's currently into Cole Porter, music from the 1920s and swing music from the 40s. So the availability and accessibility of music on the internet today is truly incredible, and I applaud anything that can inspire interest or curiosity in anyone.\
> But this also means that those of us who before would have been looking towards the current culture for inspiration are now often to be found, like my stepson, in various backwaters of older music.\
> This relative lack of need for current, innovative culture can cause, has caused, is causing - maybe - the innovative culture to slow down, much as an assembly line in Detroit slows down and lay-offs have to be made when the demand for a new model recedes."^[["Is the internet stifling new music?"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8347178.stm), 9 November 2009, _BBC News_]

Pejorative language aside ([Cole Porter](!Wikipedia) is a backwater?), does Taylor's grandson sound unhappy with old music? Would he be unhappy if his choices were universalized and less new music were created as a result?

#### In-progress works

But, you say, [Herbert](!Wikipedia "Frank Herbert") & Wolfe are fine, but dammit you have a hunger for some [Charles Stross](!Wikipedia), and can't help but be curious as to how the deuce _The Wheel of Time_ will end. OK, fine. There are ~300 million Americans who couldn't care less if a market dissolution balked you. And of course, the problem of works-in-progress is a problem that solves itself: Stross must one day die, and if he shuffles off the mortal coil tomorrow, then your situation was just the same as mine - except with a slightly higher upper bound.

And even if you were balked, or in-progress series permitted to finish, that's a fixed one-time cost^[One-time, of course. It's hard to imagine what an on-going cost for in-progress works might be. People dreaming up possible series and being unhappy that they won't be written? But we hardly are concerned by ['ten thousand freaks that died in thinking'](!Wikipedia "Absalom and Achitophel").]. It may cost quite a bit to liquidate all the companies and their assets, and shift the workers into more productive occupations, and some workers may never make that shift. But that's [creative destruction](!Wikipedia) for you: the long-term benefits win out in the long run.

#### New book smell

Maybe there's something intrinsically better about new books. Not that they deal with new subjects - we addressed that earlier - but perhaps it's about the style, or appearance, or apparent novelty. Maybe when one looks at _[Tom Jones](!Wikipedia "The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling")_, the antique language instantly subtracts 10 utilons even if it's still comprehensible.

Of course, such a 'new book smell' is irrational. Maybe Shakespeare and Chaucer aren't as enjoyable and this explains why they aren't as popular as they should be given their eminence, but for this to explain why books from the '50s or '60s are very unpopular and why books from the '00s sell much better despite reading much the same[^language], we need to posit enormous penalties.

If there is a new book smell, and it can explain why books from the recent past are less popular than new book, then that means it is nothing intrinsic about the books themselves. Which suggests that it's a matter of consumer perception; marketing has a long history of altering consumer perceptions for fun & profit.

If new books ceased to be written, then the publishers of the existing books will have to compete largely on price and marketing - which would include faking new book smell. (If people can be mistaken about whether they are buying good books, why can't be mistaken a second time about new book smell?)

We've covered quite a bit of ground here. There are a number of different theses I've tried to argue for here:

- There's more fiction then you could ever hope to consume
- People would be better off trying to read only the best fiction
- It's easier to figure out what the good old fiction is, than it is new fiction
    - there's also more good old fiction than good new fiction
- people write too much new fiction
    - they also read too much
- Society shouldn't subsidize economically inefficient things
    -  We might go so far as to suggest a [Pigovian tax](!Wikipedia) on new works because they encourage their own consumption
- The uses of fiction are much less than one might think, and many of those uses are propagandistic, dangerous, or both
- Subsidizing the nonfiction market (may be justifiable

I've hope you've been convinced of at least 2 or 3 of these theses. I rather want to reject the idea that new works should be discouraged, but the only class of objections that can hold any water is the non-substitutability one, and I don't see any solid arguments there.

People *are* better off reading the best books, and the best ones are predominately the ones that already exist, there're more than can be read, and new books have no compelling advantage over the classics. The economics place me against new fiction. And when I remember how people are beguiled by new fiction into reading crap, I find myself placed against new fiction on esthetic grounds as well.

I have started with common-sense grounds and wound up somewhere strange.

# draft

Hm. I've thought a little more about it, and I think it might be
possible to get something of value out of this argument: with a
different emphasis, we can see it as a _reductio_ against either the
idea that esthetic experiences (of art) can be compared or reckoned at
all with each other, or the idea that art can have
eternal/undiminishing esthetic value.

The reductio would go:
- Given a certain set of empirical circumstances, the collection of
art available to any human will grow, and keep on growing as artists
explore ever new mediums and genres and 'mash up' old works - the
Library of Congress never shrinks.
- Given that we won't assume that artistic competence will enter an
eternal decline, we can expect the # of works above some absolute
level of quality will likewise always grow (ie. as time passes, the #
of works greater than Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew_ will
only increase)
- Given also that a human's
lifespan/capacity-to-experience-aesthetic-experiences is fixed
- we can conclude that: no matter how high a human's standard, there
will be a point in history where enough art has been produced that he
can spend his *entire* life consuming *only* works above that standard
- at which point, the value of new art drops to zero for him, and per
my economic arguments, even have negative values

But it seems absurd that we could ever, under any circumstances,
prefer less art to more art, or even only be indifferent between a
large collection and a larger (it oughtn't be true that a Library of
Congress with 10 billion works == a LoC with 20 billion works). So we
might conclude that there is something wrong here.

If we reject the idea that art is eternal in value, then the
resolution is obvious: the value of the LoC decays over time, and it
needs to be topped up with fresh masterpieces.

Hm. My first reaction is to say, it doesn't matter. After all, while
we may not be able to put artworks into neat countable categories,
there is something we *can* count and which is absolutely crucial to
the argument: time. Our lives are only so long, and they are
denominated quite precisely, nanosecond by nanosecond. We only live
50,000 hours, I think the approximation goes. Does it matter whether
it's a ballet or a novel if we spend 1 of those hours interacting with
or collaborating with it? The art's 'essence' or 'artness' may be as
non-commodified as we please, but we can't get around the limits on
ourselves. For our finite lives, it's good enough if we call it art.

[^scratch]: I suspect Amazon is taking a considerable percentage of the ebook revenue, since in this _[New Yorker](!Wikipedia)_ article, Amazon expected a newspaper publisher to agree to give Amazon 70% of the subscription fees; Amazon has monopoly control over the Kindle, and it is reasonable to think that they are similarly demanding of book publishers. From ["Priced to Sell: Is Free the Future?"](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/07/06/090706crbo_books_gladwell), 6 July 2009, by [Malcolm Gladwell](!Wikipedia):

    > "At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, James Moroney, the publisher of the [Dallas Morning News](!Wikipedia), told Congress about negotiations he’d just had with the online retailer Amazon. The idea was to license his newspaper’s content to the Kindle, Amazon’s new electronic reader. “They want seventy per cent of the subscription revenue,” Moroney testified. “I get thirty per cent, they get seventy per cent. On top of that, they have said we get the right to republish your intellectual property to any portable device.”\
    > The idea was that if a Kindle subscription to the Dallas Morning News cost ten dollars a month, seven dollars of that belonged to Amazon, the provider of the gadget on which the news was read, and just three dollars belonged to the newspaper, the provider of an expensive and ever-changing variety of editorial content. The people at Amazon valued the newspaper’s contribution so little, in fact, that they felt they ought then to be able to license it to anyone else they wanted."

     Interestingly, this _[Slate Magazine](!Wikipedia)_ [article](http://www.slate.com/id/2230821/) takes exactly the opposite view: that Amazon is *losing* a great deal of money on each ebook:

     > "As I understand it, Amazon pays the same wholesale price for Kindle books as it does for real books—generally 50 percent of the list price. For a typical hardback that retails for $26—say, E.L. Doctorow's _Homer & Langley_—Amazon pays $13 and then sells it for $9.99 on the Kindle, taking a $3 loss on each sale. (The longer-term strategy, publishers fear, is that once the Kindle gains significant market share, Amazon will negotiate lower wholesale prices for digital versions.)"
[^subsidy]: I'm using subsidy in its broadest sense here. Intellectual property laws, for example, are subsidies; arguing for stronger IP law or more vigorous enforcement is an argument for even more government subsidy of the protected _[rentiers](!Wikipedia "rentier")_. Universities hiring professors of creative writing or English and enabling them to write their books on sabbaticals or summer vacations, and publishing them at or below cost - those are subsidies as well. Tax breaks are subsidies, etc.
[^rate]: A rate which, if surveys are to be believed, puts me in a quite rarefied percentile; eg ["One in Four Read No Books Last Year"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101045.html) (_[The Washington Post](!Wikipedia)_), and mentions the average for Americans was 4 books a year, and the median among those who read at least one book was just 7.
[^wot]: And the reason I was reading _Mistborn_ at all was curiosity as to how his _The Wheel of Time_ novels might go - WoT being an excellent example of a mediocre work that sucked time that could've gone to something better.
[^just]: Just prices are easy to set for necessities - eg. if anybody is starving to death, then the price of food is not at the just price - but this doesn't work for luxuries. And just about anything Amazon sells must be classified as a luxury. One is not going to die if one cannot afford the latest _[Madden NFL](!Wikipedia)_ video game or [James Patterson](!Wikipedia) novel.
[^propaganda]: A loaded word, I admit. But fiction is fundamentally lies - stories about things that never were and never will be - and 'convincing someone to do something they wouldn't've based on lies or rhetoric for some ulterior purpose' is as good a definition of 'propaganda' as I can think of.
[^nomenclature]: From here on, I'll just try to say 'fiction' instead of tedious expressions like 'novels or fiction'; these arguments apply as well to other mediums.
[^language]: From the distance of centuries, everything written in the 1600s sounds equally 1600-ish. But there is more intra-group variation in the books of the '50s and '90s then there is inter-group variation. A book from the 1950s can easily date itself, but it'll be usually through allusions and ideologies, and not the actual words.
[^geo]: America, and Great Britain. France contributed a little to SF with [Jules Verne](!Wikipedia), and Japan's SF is copious (albeit generally poor, derivative, & un-influential). Besides that, further sources of SF can be named on one hand. Poland offers us [Stanislaw Lem](!Wikipedia), Russia has... someone, no doubt. And that's about it. SF isn't prolific even in the Anglophone First World, much less the rest of the globe.
[^hanson]: [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia) has a number of good articles on how fiction can very easily mislead us, and that this may be a fundamental fact about the human brain (his 'Near/Far' paradigm):

[^sequels]: By a rough count of [Nebula Award for Best Novel](!Wikipedia), 14 of the 43 winners were part of some franchise or series of works. Assuming no overlap with the Hugo, we double that to 28 for the 2 awards; if each one is 'only' part of a trilogy, we need to add 84 more works to our reading list, or more than a year and a half of reading.
