> "The climate of our culture is changing. Under these new rains, new suns, small things grow great, and what was great grows small; whole species disappear and are replaced." --[Randall Jarrell](!Wikipedia)^["A Sad Heart at the Supermarket", _Daedalus_, vol. 89, no. 2 (Spring 1960)]

The [Amazon Kindle](!Wikipedia) has single-handedly ignited the [ebook](!Wikipedia) market by providing a [e-ink](!Wikipedia) interface which is visually competitive with paper, and easy access to a remarkable fraction of Amazon's inventory. It's very nice.

The pricing of the ebooks has caused some controversy; why should an ebook cost as much as $3/4$ or more of the book? The Kindle's ebooks are just small files being downloaded over a cellular network, as opposed to a multi-pound slab of exactingly manufactured wood and cloth. The former is created and delivered instantly, while the latter requires multiple elaborate factories and transportation networks to get into the reader's hands. Surely there is vast overhead for the paper, and the ebook's prices should reflect the fact that once created the marginal cost of another delivered ebook is in the single cents range, if it doesn't yet round to 0¢.

Not many expect legitimate ebooks to be priced in the cents range, since the author expects to be paid a fair bit for creating the whole thing, and the publisher expects to be paid for editing & formatting it, and Amazon is there discreetly coughing for its (substantial) share of the transactions[^scratch]. So it won't be 0¢, but why not $3 or less?

# The price is not right

In a sense, this is a [very easy](!Wikipedia "Law of supply and demand") question. The right price for ebooks is whatever the market will bear. If those are not the right prices, then consumers will simply not buy, and the price will continue to fall until they will.

In another sense, it's a difficult question as some people seem to be thinking in medieval terms, of the '[just price](!Wikipedia)', which has no objective meaning & so cannot be definitively set[^just].

## Subsidies

The more interesting question is, is there a price level mutually acceptable to consumers & sellers of books which permit the latter to survive in their current corporate forms? If there isn't, *should* the latter survive? That is, if books are no longer economically sustainable at price-points below $4 or $20, say, will society be worse off? Should publishers or novelists be subsidized[^subsidy]?

The more I think about it, the harder I find justifying any subsidy.

We value high author royalties because this allows authors to specialize in being authors, and specialization is a good thing because it allows authors to produce more than they otherwise would. And higher production is good because we value the fruits thereof.

But higher production isn't always good; production can be misguided or wasted ^[Cue communism jokes about overproduction of nails.].

# 100 apples on the wall

Here's an analogy. Suppose we all have 100 apples. Our lives do not revolve around apples, though we like them well enough. But still, 100 is too many; even if we ate 5 a day, the rest would go bad before we ate them all. And of course, it's unlikely that any of us will go to the greengrocers and buy some more. The marginal utility of apples for us have plunged to 0 (or below; I don't like clutter).

From our perspective, the farmer bringing a truck of apples to the greengrocers has only wasted his labor. Let's hope he'll find *something* to do with those surplus apples so the resources that went into making them wasn't *completely* wasted - maybe make & freeze some apple pies, or compost them.

Now suppose this wasn't a one-time gift. We live in a magic world where everyone gets 100 apples a week (where from? no one knows). Now it wasn't this one trip's worth of apples that were useless, it's the apple farmer's entire career. Isn't he wasting his life? He's a smart fellow - no reason he couldn't go do something more useful.

Sure, we can invent ways to employ this farmer. Perhaps every week he breaks into everybody's kitchens and steals their apples so they have to buy apples from him. Perhaps he'll run a large marketing campaign to convince everyone that his apples are somehow superior to the magical apples. Perhaps some people get [Granny Smith](!Wikipedia)s but really wanted [Red Delicious](!Wikipedia)es, and he makes himself an apple-trading hub, filling in deficits with apples he grows. Or he could live on government subsidy checks. Or something.

But nevertheless, these apple-farmers represent a [dead-weight loss](!Wikipedia). That's bad.

# 100 books on the shelf

> "Do technology and economic growth create problems? Certainly. But as Maurice Chevalier said about the disadvantages of growing old, consider the alternative.<br>
> I will hedge my optimism when it comes to the arts, but only marginally. It is hard to make a case that the literature, art, and music of today come close to the best work of earlier ages, let alone signify progress. On the other hand, if you chose to live in Renaissance Florence you would not be able to enjoy [Cézanne](!Wikipedia) and [Picasso](!Wikipedia). In [Johnson](!Wikipedia "Samuel Johnson")'s London, you would not be able to listen to Beethoven or Brahms. In _La [Belle Époque](!Wikipedia)_, you would not be able to read [Joyce](!Wikipedia "James Joyce") or [Faulkner](!Wikipedia "William Faulkner"). To live in today's world is not only to have access to all the best that has come before, but also to have a breadth and ease of access that is comparably greater than that enjoyed even by our parents, let alone earlier generations." --[Charles Murray](!Wikipedia "Charles Murray (author)"), _[Human Accomplishment](!Wikipedia)_

Now, can we apply this analogy? I don't have 100 apples, but perhaps I have - 100 novels.

[Science fiction](!Wikipedia) novels. And not just any random 100, but the elite, the select, the critically acclaimed winners of the 2 most prestigious SF awards for the last 50 years^[I realize that double-winners mean the equation isn't simply 2*50, but it's close enough.], the [Nebula Award](!Wikipedia) and the [Hugo Award](!Wikipedia).

## Reading them

Suppose I read 1 a week[^rate], or 52 a year. I will finish this 100 in ~2 years.

Think about that. 2 years. It will take an appreciable fraction of my life just to read a vanishingly small fraction of one small fiction genre, that itself has existed for less than 2 centuries and been confined almost exclusively to 2 countries[^geo].

And what if I want to read the prequels and sequels? Not all winners are as prolific as _[Dune](!Wikipedia "Dune universe")_, but there are a non-trivial number of duologies and trilogies and more. I can probably expect to lose another 2 or 6 years to them. Certainly, I can expect it to take another 4 years to read the 2 runner-ups for each award. And did I mention that these awards have multiple categories? Many of SF's greatest works are short stories; I don't want to miss them.

And of course, it's not like the Hugo & Nebula awards are the definitive list of SF 'books to read' - _[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction](!Wikipedia)_ treats of hundreds of writers, and mentions thousands of works; [The Encyclopedia of Fantasy](!Wikipedia) has >4000 entries. Like a fractal coast, my reading list becomes longer the closer I look...

## New = bad

> "Time destroys the groundless conceits of men; it confirms decisions founded on reality." --[Cicero](!Wikipedia)^[_De Natura Deorum_, Bk II.2]

So I'm at least a decade into my SF reading quest, and as far as I'm concerned, 0 books could have been published since. If the market had been nuked, I would be fine.

I would be better off, actually. The last SF or Fantasy I read was [Brandon Sanderson](!Wikipedia)'s _[Mistborn](!Wikipedia "Mistborn series")_ trilogy. It was pretty good, but I know I could've done much better. My reading time is finite, and reading _Mistborn_ pushed out reading [Gene Wolfe](!Wikipedia)'s _[Book of the Long Sun](!Wikipedia)_ tetralogy - which I know I would've ultimately enjoyed more. If the market had imploded before _Mistborn_ came out, I would've read _Long Sun_ instead.

(The connection to other aspects of modern life and _akrasia_ is apparent: there's a [Gresham's Law](!Wikipedia) whereby cheap & unsatisfying things will push out more satisfying but more demanding entertainment.)

It wouldn't be difficult to spend the rest of my life reading only SF published before 2009, and it would certainly be more efficient as time has proven to be pretty good at winnowing the good from the bad.

### Generalizing this

But only reading SF is a little impoverishing. I always wanted to get into mysteries and French literature. But there go another 2 decades, at least. Now I'm in my 50s. I'd better get cracking if I ever want to go through English literature or anything Asian, or heck, nonfiction!

So, why do I care what happens to the SF market? How does it concern me that the short story magazines (which incubate new writers) are collapsing? I have no need for them. I already have 100 apples.

### Music

Or how about music? Just the small genre of classical music, say. I once downloaded a complete collection of [J.S. Bach](!Wikipedia) which came to 17G. I've no idea how many hours of music that is and am too frightened to calculate it. And how many listens would it take to reasonably appreciate it? Possibly a lifetime's worth. Why should I be the least bit interested in some publisher trying to sell me another CD of the [Brandenburg Concertos](!Wikipedia)? I'm not a conductor, I will hear no improvement. To me, there is no difference between the world's greatest pianist and the 10^th^-greatest.

### Movies

Or consider another medium: movies. Have you seen even a fraction of the [IMDB](!Wikipedia "Internet Movie Database")'s [Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top)? There are some pretty incredible movies in there. Some of them are profound, others moving, and not a few profoundly moving. Why are you going to watch _[Transformers 2](!Wikipedia "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen")_ or _[Ice Age 3](!Wikipedia "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs")_? For entertainment value? But there are movies in that list which are far more entertaining, I assure you.

Even if you've seen the top 50, there's another 200 to choose from. (And as before, at 1 or 2 a week, there's years worth there.)

## Media shock

I hope I've made my point: we live in an age of *profound* media abundance. Like none before us, we can partake of the greatest works in all mediums of all ages. We do not sip from a water fountain laboriously supplied by hard-working artists & authors, nor even guzzle from a fire-hose hooked up to a printing press; we are being shot off [Victoria Falls](!Wikipedia). The impact alone will kill us.

# Let's ban new books

> "There is nothing so absurd but that some philosopher has said it." --[Cicero](!Wikipedia)^[_De Divinatione_, bk. 2, sct. 58]

> "The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, & to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it." --[Bertrand Russell](!Wikipedia)^["The Philosophy of [Logical Atomism](!Wikipedia)"]

With our too too short lives, and so much to see, one does oneself a great disservice by consuming anything but the best.

And thus, do not authors & artists do us a disservice by creating mediocrity we, being only human, will at least try? Maybe these authors & artists are only creating [attractive nuisance](!Wikipedia)s!

Let's look back on the argument:

- Society ought to *discourage economically* inefficient activities.<br> At least, it *ought not to encourage* inefficiency. It may not do this perfectly, but this is still a desiderata; special pleading for some activity, saying that some other activity or market is far more economically inefficient, is not good enough. (Children know this; 'just because someone else does it doesn't make it right for you'.)
- If some good _a_ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing & available good _b_ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to produce _a_ and not use _b_.
- Consumers of new novels would be equally satisfied by existing novels.
- It is economically inefficient to produce new novels.
- ∴ Society ought to discourage new novels

The tl;dr version is: old stuff is as good as the new & cheaper, so making new stuff is a waste.

## Objections

The above is not a formal proof - formalizing it wouldn't convince anyone of anything, and I don't know enough economics to do it well, although surely possible. After all, the argument is basically 'anything inefficient is be discouraged; new novels are inefficient; QED new novels are to be discouraged'.
But it's good enough that we can act as if it is.

One of the basic tactics with any objectionable argument is to see whether any of the inference steps are faulty. In this case, we can see that there is nothing wrong with the logic. So we're left with rejecting some/all of the premises, or accepting the conclusion.

We can reject:

1. that societies ought to encourage efficiency
2. that creating something when there's an existing object is inefficient
3. that old books can replace new ones.

### Society doesn't care?

Now, #1 seems unobjectionable. To reject that premise is to argue either that society ought to discourage economic efficiency, or neither favor nor disfavor efficiency.

The former is obviously crazy. There are governmental programs and policies whose proponents acknowledge that they are economically inefficient, but they agree that their inefficiency is a flaw, and the programs are justifiable not because of, but despite - they supposedly deliver some other benefit which compensates for the cost.

The latter is not so obviously crazy. But millions of voters consistently respond to candidates who claim that they can and will grow the economy & make things better; and governments have a long history of supporting projects - like bridges & highways - whose justifications are that 'society (and specifically, government) ought to help make parts of the economy more efficient'.

So if you want to reject the whole argument because you dislike premise #1, you are either ignoring sanity or you're ignoring history.

### What's efficiency anyway?

Premise #2 is weaker. To me, this premise about substitutability seems so obvious that I'm not sure how to defend it. If you need a glove, and you have a perfectly good one already, isn't spending $20 on a new glove the same thing as throwing your money away? Isn't #2 just a generalization of this obvious fact?

If you reject #2, I'm not really sure what economics you're working under. But there are a few objections we could classify under this heading, generally dealing with [externalities](!Wikipedia).

#### They Snatched Society's Brain!

An interlocutor might suggest that perhaps the creation & consumption of new fiction[^nomenclature] or novels serves some laudable purpose beyond simply making the time pass enjoyably, even if the latter on its own merits is inefficient & cannot justify the creation of new works.

Now, what good deeds could only *new* works produce? Certainly it's not edifying & educating our youth; given the rise of relativisms of all kind in the 20th century and looser standards of decency, new works arguably would be detrimental in this regard.

Ah, new fiction could be an important societal mechanism for discussing new developments and for pondering the future. SF would be an excellent example of this. Who but knows that the constant undercurrent of cloning and space travel and computers in SF has not helped society prepare mentally for the future? Hasn't SF directly inspired any number of young men & women to enter the hard sciences (as opposed to dedicating their talents to, say, finance), with benefits redounding to all humanity? What's a dead-weight loss of a few hundred million or billion a year compared with landing on the Moon?

This is an uncomfortable argument to me. It's arguing that fiction is justified inasmuch as it makes superior propaganda[^propaganda]. It may be propaganda in the service of a noble & good cause, and swaying someone to choose a career in science is not as objectionable as propagandizing children into clearing Iraqi minefields with their bodies - but the morality of it is difficult.

And a utilitarian might cavil about the benefits. Fiction can be unfairly persuasive, bypassing our rational faculties[^hanson]. (SF is often good inversely proportional to how many educational lectures it contains.)

As a society, is it *good* to have our discussions and views about incredibly important matters like space exploration hijacked in even the slightest by fiction? It's hard to see why fiction would yield discussion of equal or superior quality to discussions based on non-fiction. [Fictional evidence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/) is particularly unpleasant. I think particularly of wincingly bad discussions of AI; if one sees any mention of the fictional entities [HAL 9000](!Wikipedia) or [Skynet](!Wikipedia "Skynet (Terminator)"), one must avert one's gaze lest one's IQ drop 10 points. A sober discussion including the nonfictional entity [SHRDLU](!Wikipedia) might be halfway sensible.

So either fiction is effective as propaganda and setting societal agendas, or it isn't. If the latter, then the loss is trivial; if the former, then fiction could well be *bad*!

#### Two sides of the same organ

Maybe there's a different externality. Instead of lubricating and powering decision-making, or funneling people into science, maybe fiction serves as kind of a right brain to society - indirectly enabling creative thinking and breakthroughs that a more sober society will not.

This thesis reminds me of the [Orson Welles](!Wikipedia) quote from _[The Third Man](!Wikipedia)_ that goes:

> "You know what the fellow said—in Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace—and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."

On the other hand, Switzerland is, adjusted for size, one of the [most scientifically prolific](http://mangans.blogspot.com/2009/07/scientific-impact-of-nations.html) countries in the world. ([Albert Einstein](!Wikipedia) was a Swiss citizen, incidentally.)

The evidence for this 'right brain' idea might be that every country the interlocutor can think of which was a great scientific or technological power was also strong in the humanities (exceptions like Soviet Russia only proving the rule).

But of course, this might be confusing correlation with causation. What characterizes those countries is a freedom of action, a freedom to pursue what intellectual pursuits one wished. Some incline to the arts, some to the sciences. Successes in both domains spring from a common cause, not each other. After all, if the arts could fertilize the sciences, one would expect some reciprocity - and the humanities have made [notoriously little use](!Wikipedia "The Two Cultures")^[And while the situation has gotten better since Snow's day, can we really say there's so much cross-fertilization as to prove this externality, or prove it of sufficient magnitude?] of science's techniques, worldview, or results.

Conceptually, I see no problem with a nation of sober hard-headed engineers and scientists doing quite as well without the novelists.

If we think of specifics, the idea of cross-fertilization retreats. What helped Isaac Newton? When Einstein thought of riding a beam of light, did novels play any role? What hath [Harold Pinter](!Wikipedia) to do with [Stephen Hawking](!Wikipedia)?

#### Won't someone think of the chemists?

One could worry that the failure of fiction markets to find a sustainable model might mean the end for nonfiction material, which includes things precious to us all such as science.

But this worry is unnecessary. There are several possibilities.

The nonfiction market *could* be subsidized. This is quite justifiable. Science, after all, is heavily subsidized already. Why? Because it has enormous value ^[How much economic growth since the Middle Ages has been due to science & technology, and not just increased population & resource exploitation? Quite a bit...] and new research can't be replaced by old, almost by definition. There's intrinsic value to populating new chapters and books with results, one that isn't there with fiction.

The nonfiction market could well survive as the fiction one withers away. Fields with largely unchanging textbooks might well lose the subsidy of students forced to buy the latest one, but that's a rather predatory subsidy and probably much more valuable to the publishers than the content producers, so the loss would be minimal.

### Accept no substitutes, or, I can't believe it's not Butler

The claim of #3 is that we can, without loss, switch everyone over from reading contemporary fiction to not-so-contemporary fiction. I daresay this is the premise everyone will question immediately. We all know the classics are an essential part of an intellectually balanced breakfast, but can they be all of it?

In many respects, much of fiction books is worthless. For example, the medieval Japanese believed that _[The Tale of Genji](!Wikipedia)_ was missing several chapters. Suppose this were true? How exactly has the world been harmed? People seem to enjoy _Genji monogatari_ quite well enough. Would the discovery of 3 or 4 ending chapters *improve* the world? Clearly it would lead to a great deal of work being done, since all sorts of textbooks and papers might have to be updated, but how likely is it that the extra chapters will make _Genji_ a greater work? _Genji_ isn't the most tightly plotted work. If an act were cut out of _[Macbeth](!Wikipedia)_, it would be a poorer play for it, and many poems would suffer for losing a chunk; but plays and poems are usually written with an eye to performance - there's a premium on space that there isn't really with novels. Consider [Charles Dicken](!Wikipedia)'s _[The Pickwick Papers](!Wikipedia)_. If 100 pages dropped right out of the middle, do you think any new readers would notice?

People might *say* that they would derive much less enjoyment from an incomplete, edited, or abridged version, but I don't know how much we can trust such utterances. They might just be making a ritual genuflection to the eminent author, or upholding a social image as a person who cares about accuracy, completeness, and authenticity. If we can't, if there is some ceiling of _n_ utilons which is hit by many books, then premise #3 is saved.

But can we assume that there's a low ceiling for how enjoyable all books are? _[Moby Dick](!Wikipedia)_ is quite different from _[The Inimitable Jeeves](!Wikipedia)_, or _[The Importance of Being Earnest](!Wikipedia)_. Alice may value the former much lower than the 2 latter, while Bob wants a nautical drama & not a comedy of manners. In this case, because the 3 works all exist in the public domain, both Alice & Bob can be satisfied and we reach an optimum.

But what if the book Bob desires hasn't been published, but would be soon were there a market? He will be saddened to have to read of butlers and harpooners instead of the shadow war of [Pirates versus Ninjas](!Wikipedia). In this binary case, Alice will still be fine, but Bob will be worse off.

The full example is not so bad for us, though. It's plausible that Bob would enjoy _Pirates vs. Ninja: The Stabbening_ more than _Moby Dick_. But there are over 32 million books in the [Library of Congress](!Wikipedia); is Bob so extraordinarily picky that not a single existing book would be as or more enjoyable than PvN?

(And for once, cognitive biases work in our favor: people can't be distressed by the works never created; they aren't by uncreated jobs or pleased by prevented disasters.)

#### In-progress works

But, you say, [Herbert](!Wikipedia "Frank Herbert") & Wolfe are fine, but dammit you have a hunger for some [Charles Stross](!Wikipedia), and can't help but be curious as to how the deuce _The Wheel of Time_ will end. OK, fine. There are ~300 million Americans who couldn't care less if a market dissolution balked you. And of course, the problem of works-in-progress is a problem that solves itself: Stross must one day die, and if he kicks the bucket August 2009, then your situation is just the same as mine - except with a slightly higher upper bound.

And even if you were balked, or in-progress series permitted to finish, that's just a fixed one-time cost^[One-time, of course. It's hard to imagine what an on-going cost for in-progress works might be. People dreaming up possible series and being unhappy that they won't be written? But we hardly are concerned by '10 thousand freaks that died in thinking'.]. It is like shutting down the fiction industry - it may cost quite a bit to liquidate all the companies and their assets, and shift the workers into more productive occupations, and some workers may well never shift into a more productive industry. But that's [creative destruction](!Wikipedia) for you: the long-run benefits will win out in the long run.

#### New book smell

Maybe there's something intrinsically better about new books. Not that they deal with new subjects - we addressed that earlier - but perhaps it's about the style, or appearance, or apparent novelty. Maybe when one looks at _[Tom Jones](!Wikipedia "The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling")_, the antique language instantly subtracts 10 utilons even if one can understand it perfectly well.

Of course, such a 'new book smell' is irrational. Maybe Shakespeare and Chaucer aren't as enjoyable and this explains why they aren't as popular as they should be given their eminence, but for this to explain why books from the '50s or '60s are very unpopular and why books from the '00s sell much better despite reading much the same[^language], we need to posit major & arbitrary deductions.

If there is a new book smell, and it can explain why books from the recent past are less popular than new book, then that means it is nothing intrinsic about the books themselves. Which suggests that it's a matter of consumer perception; marketing has a long and fairly successful history of altering consumer perceptions for fun & money.

If new books ceased to be written, then the publishers of the existing books will have to compete largely on price and marketing - which would include faking new book smell. (And if people can be mistaken about the quality of the new books they are buying, nothing says they can't be mistaken a second time about whether a book has new book smell or not.)

# At the end of the day
We've covered quite a bit of ground here. There are a number of different theses I've tried to argue for here:

- There's more fiction then you could ever hope to consume
- People would be better off trying to read only the best fiction
- It's easier to figure out what the good old fiction is, than it is new fiction
    - there's also more good old fiction than good new fiction
- people write too much new fiction
    - _corollary_: they also read too much
- Society shouldn't subsidize economically inefficient things
    -  We might go so far as to suggest a [Pigovian tax](!Wikipedia) on new works because they encourage their own consumption
- The uses of fiction are much less than one might think, and many of those uses are propagandistic, dangerous, or both
- Subsidizing the nonfiction market (further) may be justifiable

I've hope you've been convinced of at least 2 or 3 of these theses. I rather want to reject the idea that new works should be discouraged, but the only class of objections that can hold any water is the non-substitutability one, and I don't see any solid arguments there.

People *are* better off reading the best books, and the best ones are predominately the ones that already exist, there're more than they can hope to read, and new books have no compelling advantage over the classics. The economics place me against new fiction. And when I remember how people are beguiled by new fiction into reading crap, I find myself placed against new fiction on esthetic grounds as well.

I have started with common-sense grounds and wound up somewhere strange.

[^scratch]: I suspect Amazon is taking a considerable percentage of the ebooks, since in this New Yorker article, Amazon expected a newspaper publisher to agree to give Amazon 70% of the subscription fees; Amazon has monopoly control over the Kindle, and it is reasonable to think that they are similarly demanding of book publishers. From ["Priced to Sell: Is Free the Future?"](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/07/06/090706crbo_books_gladwell), 6 July 2009, by [Malcolm Gladwell](!Wikipedia):

    > "At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, James Moroney, the publisher of the [Dallas Morning News](!Wikipedia), told Congress about negotiations he’d just had with the online retailer Amazon. The idea was to license his newspaper’s content to the Kindle, Amazon’s new electronic reader. “They want seventy per cent of the subscription revenue,” Moroney testified. “I get thirty per cent, they get seventy per cent. On top of that, they have said we get the right to republish your intellectual property to any portable device.”<br>
    > The idea was that if a Kindle subscription to the Dallas Morning News cost ten dollars a month, seven dollars of that belonged to Amazon, the provider of the gadget on which the news was read, and just three dollars belonged to the newspaper, the provider of an expensive and ever-changing variety of editorial content. The people at Amazon valued the newspaper’s contribution so little, in fact, that they felt they ought then to be able to license it to anyone else they wanted."
[^subsidy]: I'm using subsidy in its broadest sense here. Intellectual property laws, for example, are subsidies; arguing for stronger IP law or more vigorous enforcement is a government subsidy of the protected _rentiers_. Universities hiring professors of creative writing or English and enabling them to write their books on sabbaticals or summer vacations, and publishing them at or below cost - those are subsidies as well. Tax breaks are subsidies, etc.
[^rate]: A rate which, if surveys are to be believed, puts me in a quite rarefied percentile.
[^wot]: And the reason I was reading _Mistborn_ at all was curiosity as to how his _[The Wheel of Time](!Wikipedia)novels might go - WoT being an excellent example of a mediocre work that sucked time that could've gone to something better.
[^just]: Just prices are easy to set for necessities - eg. if anybody is starving to death, then the price of food is not at the just price - but this doesn't work for luxuries. And just about anything Amazon sells must be classified as a luxury. One is not going to die if one cannot afford a new network switch or the latest _Madden_ football video game.
[^propaganda]: A loaded word, I admit. But fiction is fundamentally lies - stories about things that never were and never will be - and 'convincing someone to do something they wouldn't've based on lies or rhetoric for some ulterior purpose' is as good a definition of 'propaganda' as I can think of.
[^nomenclature]: From here on, I'll just try to say 'fiction' instead of tedious expressions like 'novels or fiction'; many of these arguments would apply as well to other artistic mediums; basically any field over a century probably has built up a sufficient stock of masterpieces for these arguments to work.<br> Fields that are new, or still technically developing, may be able to evade these arguments. For example, video games - even the greatest arcade games from 20 or 30 years ago have a hard time competing against even average games from within the past few years.
[^language]: From the distance of centuries, everything written in the 1600s sounds equally 1600-ish. But there is more intra-group variation in the books of the '50s and '90s then there is inter-group variation. A book from the 1950s can easily date itself, but it'll be usually through allusions and ideologies, and not the actual words.
[^geo]: America, and Great Britain. France contributed a little to SF with Jules Verne, and Japan's SF is copious (albeit generally poor, derivative, & un-influential). Besides that, further sources of SF can be named on one hand. Poland offers us [Stanislaw Lem](!Wikipedia), Russia has... someone, no doubt. And that's about it. SF isn't prolific even in the Anglophone First World, much less the rest of the globe.
[^Hanson]: [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia) has a number of good articles on how fiction can very easily mislead us, and that this may be a fundamental fact about the human brain (his 'Near/Far' architecture:
