OB comment about specialists vs generalists:

> Here's a thought. Are these broad questions increasing in number or decreasing in number or static?
>
> If they are either of the latter, then fewer undergraduates able to grapple about them may not be bad, since the population is growing so much. Per capita, the number of generalists can shrink but still be going up in absolute terms.
>
> Another thought. These questions tend to be very old. Old questions have been thought about by many people with many perspectives, and it's unlikely you'll make a new worthwhile contribution compared to thinking about new questions. So since these generalist questions seem to usually be very old and unrewarding, you would want most people to be focused on new questions.
>
> (I guess you would want as few people working on old questions as it takes to apply new observations and methods to the old questions, in the hope that the new observation/method might finally crack it.)

Cost of IP subsidy:

> In February 2007, Microsoft lost a $1.5 billion judgment for infringing on MP3 patents, even though Microsoft had licensed MP3! The problem with MP3 is that multiple companies have patent claims, which makes the situation a particular mess. We can argue as to whether patents add value, but they indisputably add costs.
>
> The Software Freedom Law Center calculates that Microsoft has paid $4 billion in lawsuits in the last three years to companies who have won patent claims against the company, which works out to a tax of $20 per copy of Windows. (The costs are actually higher because some of the settlements are secret.)

Another idea:

> There's evidence that the long tail has been overblown, and if anything, blockbusters are taking more of the market. (As one might expect of someone as glib and fad-driven as Chris Anderson.) If this is true, it's strong evidence that just as terrorism is not about terror, culture is... well, not about esthetics. (It's about shibboleths and injokes and that sort of social thing.)

> An EU Directive to harmonise and increase protection for databases was adopted in 1996. Its aims were to (a) harmonise laws between Member States to aid the functioning of the single market and (b) increase protection for databases in those Member States where they were “not sufficiently protected”. The hope was that by introducing such protection throughout the EU, database producers would be incentivised to invest in databases and information processing systems, and thereby reduce the “very great imbalance” in the level of investment in the database sector between the EU and third countries – notably the US, which has no such right. The aim was to ensure the EU got a foothold in this growing sector at an early stage. The European Commission carried out an evaluation of the Directive in 2006.13 This found that EU database creation had declined since introduction of the Directive, whilst it had continued to rise in the US, undermining the rationale for the right in the first place. The EU Database Directive remains unchanged.

> Economic evidence is clear that the likely deadweight loss to the economy exceeds any additional incentivising effect which might result from the extension of copyright term beyond its present levels.14 This is doubly clear for retrospective extension to copyright term, given the impossibility of incentivising the creation of already existing works, or work from artists already dead. Despite this, there are frequent proposals to increase term, such as the current proposal to extend protection for sound recordings in Europe from 50 to 70 or even 95 years. The UK Government assessment found it to be economically detrimental.15 An international study found term extension to have no impact on output.16

> Among other things, we went out and interviewed 22 companies, and we added to that 69 questionnaires about various aspects of company patent policy and their susceptibility to compulsory licensing. We also did a very large statistical analysis and came to a number of conclusions that, at least at the time, given the way the patent system was being viewed by most scholars, were, to us, mind boggling. One of our conclusions was that patents just weren't very important in large corporations' research and development decisions. Of 91 respondents, only 7 accorded high significance to patent protection as a factor in their R&D investments. Most cited patents as the least important of considerations. Most of them said that what was really important in their research and development decisions was the necessity of remaining competitive, the desire for efficient production, and the desire to expand and diversify their sales. A lot of the companies in our sample had, in fact, been subjected to patent compulsory licensing decrees. And the vast majority of them said that the decrees had had, at most, a very, very minor negative impact on their R&D investments.

> "The evolution of copyright from an occasional grant of royal privilege to a formal and eventually widespread system of law should in principle have enhanced composers' income from publication. The evidence from our quantitative comparison of honoraria received by Beethoven, with no copyright law in his territory, and Robert Schumann, benefiting from nearly universal European copyright, provides at best questionable support for the hypothesis that copyright fundamentally changed composers' fortunes. From the qualitative evidence on Giuseppe Verdi, who was the first important composer to experience the new Italian copyright regime and devise strategies to derive maximum advantage, it is clear that copyright could make a substantial difference. In the case of Verdi, greater remuneration through full exploitation of the copyright system led perceptibly to a lessening of composing effort."

Boldrin and Levine, the authors of Against Intellectual Monopoly, performed a detailed, careful econometric analysis in 2009 and concluded that the “optimal” copyright term ought to be about 2 years, and patents about 5 to 10 years: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1432245 ; but note:

> [Levine:] These results assume that without IP a smaller fraction of the social surplus is recovered by the inventor/creator than with IP–that is the sense in which we assume that copyright and patent have some benevolent effect. That is, we assume that IP actually increases innovation. What we ignore is the downstream effect of IP–that future innovation/creation is reduced due to existing rights. We also ignore the fact that the producers who count–the marginal ones–are not especially likely to benefit from IP. In practice I suspect that those two are the main reasons that empirically IP just doesn't increase creation/innovation. Of course our calculation ignores any other social costs of IP other than the standard economic loss due to monopoly power.
http://blog.mises.org/17319/optimal-patent-and-copyright-term-length/

“Why a Seventeen Year Patent,” 38 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y 839 (1956), C. Michael White describes the historical basis for the seventeen-year patent term and proposes shortened terms.

Merges & Nelson, in “On the Complex Economics of Patent Scope,” pp. 868–70,  argue that most economic models of patent scope and duration focus on the relation between breadth, duration, and incentives to innovate, without giving serious consideration to the social costs of greater duration and breadth in the form of retarded subsequent improvement.

> This lack of a single unified patent system creates self evident problems for innovative firms attempting to operate in the European market compared with the unified markets of the US, India and China.8 It causes wasteful duplication in terms of litigation in each jurisdiction – projected private annual savings on duplicated litigation alone are estimated at between €120 million and €240 million.9 Furthermore, it increases the cost of cross border commerce. Removal of inter EU country barriers in IP could increase UK national income by over £2billion a year by 2020.10

> After IBM's presentation, our turn came. As the Big Blue crew looked on (without a flicker of emotion), my colleagues - all of whom had both engineering and law degrees - took to the whiteboard with markers, methodically illustrating, dissecting, and demolishing IBM's claims. We used phrases like: "You must be kidding," and "You ought to be ashamed." But the IBM team showed no emotion, save outright indifference. Confidently, we proclaimed our conclusion: Only one of the seven IBM patents would be deemed valid by a court, and no rational court would find that Sun's technology infringed even that one.
>
> An awkward silence ensued. The blue suits did not even confer among themselves. They just sat there, stonelike. Finally, the chief suit responded. "OK," he said, "maybe you don't infringe these seven patents. But we have 10,000 U.S. patents. Do you really want us to go back to Armonk [IBM headquarters in New York] and find seven patents you do infringe? Or do you want to make this easy and just pay us $20 million?" After a modest bit of negotiation, Sun cut IBM a check, and the blue suits went to the next company on their hit list.

Following excerpts from Tyler Cowen's _Good and Plenty_

> Art lovers sometimes write or talk as if economic costs do not matter. They tend to evaluate regimes in terms of the quality of the art that is produced, without considering the opportunity costs of that art. More and better art is equated with a better society. We are never told how many bags of potato chips, or how many antipoverty programs, we should sacrifice to receive another great artistic performance, or how we might hope to find out such an answer. The economic approach reflects the view of the common man that art is not everything, or even the most important thing.
>
> The Federal Writers' Project of the New Deal supported Saul Bellow, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, and Zora Neale Hurston, among other individuals who later became noted writers (see chapter 3). Many literature lovers then conclude that the program was a good one. The economist, in contrast, could point out that the Federal Writers' Project spent $27 million for about one thousand books and pamphlets, at a cost of $27,000 per publication. Translated into dollars for the year 2000, this amounts to $337,500 per publication, or $337.5 million for the total. While some of the publications were of very high quality, they cost a great deal. It is hard to believe that offering indiscriminate literary advances of $337,500 per work is a worthwhile investment, even if it produces some first-rate books. Frederic Bastiat, writing in the nineteenth century, argued that proponents of arts subsidies typically focus on “what is seen” and neglect “what is not seen,” namely the other projects and outputs that would have been funded with the money.[On the dollar figures, see Mangione (1972, p. 369). Mangione, Jerre. 1972. _The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writer’s Project, 1935–1943_. Boston: Little, Brown and Company On the seen and the unseen, see Bastiat (1850). Bastiat, Frédéric. 1850. _Essays on Political Economy_. London: A. W. Bennett]

> These artworks benefit relatively small numbers of people, including the artist, but the benefits are significant for each recipient. Most of the benefits lie well above the threshold of noticeability, and thus they increase human happiness. The less extreme form of the argument, rather than finding a free lunch, relies on antiegalitarian intuitions. We take small amounts from many individuals to give concentrated benefits to a few, and indeed often to the relatively wealthy. The distribution of goodness in society becomes less equal, but our peaks of aesthetic achievement become more beautiful. Subsidy supporters do not like to publicize this reality, but these antiegalitarian intuitions are central to many of the arguments for subsidies.

> According to figures for U.S. symphony orchestras, 33 percent of their income comes from private donations; endowments and related sources account for another 16 percent. Concert income generates 42 percent of revenue, and direct government support provides only 6 percent. Looking at nonprofit arts institutions more generally, individual, corporate, and foundation donors make up about 45 percent of the budget. Twelve percent of income comes from foundation grants; this is two and a half times more than the contribution of the NEA and state arts councils combined. While these numbers fluctuate each year, they provide a rough measure of the relevant magnitudes.[See Johnson (1997, p. 9); the data refer to 1995.

> That being said, the U.S. government supports the arts far more than these figures would indicate. Let us now turn to indirect subsidies in more detail, starting with the role of the tax system. American policy provides support for artistic nonprofits but lets donors decide which institutions will receive the funds. The government is removed from the role of judging artistic quality, yet creative activity receives a spur nonetheless.
>
> The tax system provides the most significant arts subsidy in the United States. Rough estimates suggest that Americans donated over $29.4 billion to the category “Arts, Culture, and the Humanities” in 2003. This amounts to about $100 for each individual in the United States. In contrast, individual private philanthropy to the arts is virtually nonexistent in most European nations. If we look at individual donors, Americans give almost ten times more to nonprofits, per capita, than their French counterparts give. [See Giving USA (2003, pp. 195–97). On the French comparison, see Archambault (1997, p. 208). Archambault, Edith. 1997. The Nonprofit Sector in France. Manchester, England: Manchester University Press.]
>
> We do not know, for instance, how much very large changes in tax rates would affect donations and nonprofits. Nonetheless if we take this figure as a workable and available estimate, the U.S. government is making a fiscal sacrifice in the range of $26 billion to $41 billion to support the arts.6 [6. See Clotfelter (1985, chap. 2, and p. 274). Clotfelter, Charles T. 1985. Federal Tax Policy and Charitable Giving. Chicago: University of Chicago Press]
>
> The estate tax also boosts arts donations. To avoid paying taxes on bequests, many individuals leave money to nonprofits and arts institutions. [Some provisions of the tax law have hurt artists. This includes the taxation of fellowship awards and unemployment compensation (both instituted in 1986), disallowance of income averaging (which had helped artists with volatile incomes), and the 1986 restrictions on in-kind deductions for artworks given to museums. But for the most part the American tax system subsidizes the arts significantly.]
>
> European governments do not offer comparable tax benefits to their arts. France, for instance, limits tax deductions to 1 percent of taxable income for individuals and 0.1 percent for corporations. Other countries, such as Germany, have allowed tax deductibility in law but made the deduction unworkable through bureaucratic restrictions. In particular, individual donors had to give through complex intermediary institutions and endure heavy paperwork. In 1999 Germany took steps to move closer to the American model, but the fundamental nature of German arts policy has yet to make the transition. France is beginning to make similar steps. England allows tax deductions but also makes the requirements more difficult than in the United States. Typically a taxpayer has had to agree to make payments for at least seven years to earn the deduction. Furthermore, the donations have not always been deductible at the top marginal rate, but rather at a lower rate. [See Frey and Pommerehne (1989, p. 43) Frey, Bruno S., and Werner W. Pommerehne. 1989. Muses and Markets: Explorations in the Economics of the Arts. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Basil Blackwell. and on England, see Clotfelter (1985, pp. 96–97). Schuster (1989, p. 33) catalogs some of the tax privileges that European governments have granted to the arts since the Second World War. Schuster, J.

> For these reasons, some European arts institutions, especially in Great Britain, find their leading private donors in the United States. In the mid-1980s, J. Paul Getty donated $62.5 million to the National Gallery in London, the largest donation the institution has received.

> Consider the Minneapolis Artspace group, which wanted to renovate a decrepit warehouse and turn it into artists’ apartments and studios. They started by going to the State Housing Finance Agency and applying for low-income tax credits, available for renovation projects. These credits are paid for by the federal government but allocated through state governments. The project had an estimated value of $20 million, which meant that the available tax credit was about $900,000 per year. This sum is paid out yearly for ten years, or $9 million in total. ArtSpace used these tax credits to get a bank loan of $7 million and then set up a corporate partnership, in essence “selling” the tax credits to the corporate partner for cash. ArtSpace also financed 20 percent of the $20 million cost from the historic tax credits available through the Department of the Interior, again “selling” these tax credits for 93¢ on the dollar. Eleven million of the $20 million total was now in hand, and construction could begin. County and state tax programs served to complete the financing, and the remainder was raised from private foundations, again with an implicit tax break for the donations.[Conlogue, Ray. 2000. “From the St. Lawrence Centre to Steel City.” Toronto Globe and Mail, June 21, p. R5.]
>
> In fiscal year 2002, U.S. libraries had budgets of over $8 billion, most of which came from government support, usually at the local level. This is the largest and best-developed public library system in the world.[That is from the National Center for Education Statistics; see http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005356.pdf ]
>
> Since the 1920s, U.S. foreign policy has ensured that foreign markets stay open to Hollywood exports. In 1926 the Department of Commerce added a Motion Picture Section. After the Second World War, America used foreign aid and its military muscle to discourage European cultural protectionism, especially in Italy, France, and England. The struggle continued through institutions associated with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and then the World Trade Organization. The State Department also supported the cartelization of Hollywood export efforts through the major studios. Hollywood currently receives export tax subsidies, which of course support the production of films at home. Note that this support has involved an implicit trading of favors. Hollywood might not have received governmental assistance in opening markets had it not strongly supported the American role in World War II.
>
> Some trade subsidies arise through the failure to enforce laws. The U.S. government has helped make America a center of the art world by relatively laissez-faire importation policies. Imported artworks, unlike most other forms of commerce, are exempt from import and export duties in the United States. This policy has stimulated American art collecting and has helped make New York a center of the art world. Note that in 1883 American artists lobbied successfully for a heavy tax on the importation of artworks, fearing competition from European creators. The famous Armory Show of 1913 introduced modern art to the United States and stimulated an entire generation of painters. The show became possible only when this tax was repealed shortly before its staging.[See Goldstein (2000, pp. 59, 89, 109). Goldstein, Malcolm. 2000. Landscape with Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States. Oxford: Oxford University Press.]
>
> The U.S. government has subsidized postal mailings since the beginning of the Postal Service in the late eighteenth century. Newspapers, which carried literary installments and informed the public about the arts, received especially favorable treatment. Starting in 1851 the Postal Service offered subsidized rates to book mailings. The period 1874 to 1885 brought further rate changes that gave a huge boost to the mailing of magazines. By the end of this time magazines were cheaper to mail than were advertising circulars. The result was a magazine boom, which gave writers a new way to reach audiences and make a living. Between 1885 and 1900, the number of magazines with 100,000 circulation or more rose from 21 to 85; by 1905 the figure was 159. By 1903 Ladies' Home Journal had garnered more than one million subscribers.
>
> The first artist-in-residence in an American university was American painter John Steuart Curry, who worked at the University of Wisconsin in the 1930s. The pianist Gun- nar Johansen joined him there in 1939. Robert Frost received support from the University of Michigan, which in fact offered him a stipend for life. For the most part, however, the artist at the university is a post–World War II development, most of all from the 1960s.[Morrison, Jack. 1973. _The Rise of the Arts on the American Campus_. New York: McGraw-Hill]
>
> Creative writing programs, often at state or state-subsidized universities, train American writers or help them connect with publishing houses. John Barth spent the first twenty years of his career at two state universities, Penn State and SUNY Buffalo. A study of the New York Times Book Review found that 31 percent of the reviewed authors earned their living from the academic world (although this figure includes nonfiction books as well).[51. Hamilton (2000, p. 31). ]Hamilton, John Maxwell. 2000. Casanova Was a Book Lover, and Other Naked Truths and Provocative Curiosities about the Writing, Selling, and Reading of Books. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press] Universities support the arts in many ways, not just through full-time faculty hires. In the world of classical music, almost every composer serves as a “guest composer” at a university for some period of time. Universities also are a venue for classical music performances. They bring performers to audiences, including to smaller towns such as Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Bloomington, Indiana. The recent boom in “world music” is due, in part, to the concerts held at universities. The University of California at Davis alone spends $7 million a year on the performing arts.[Arenson, Karen W. 2002. “Arts Groups and Artists Find Angels: Universities.” The New York Times, October 30, pp. B1, B8] Roughly two dozen universities are currently active in commissioning new artworks. The list includes Ohio State University, the University of Iowa, the University of Michigan, and the University of California, all state schools. The University of Iowa is arguably the leader in this regard, having commissioned more than eighty works since 1986.
>
> The university poetry anthology—required reading for many introductory survey classes—provides the primary market demand for the writings of poets. Contemporary poets receive royalty income and some measure of fame from these volumes. Universities also subsidize many literary magazines. DePaul University has published Poetry East, and Southern Methodist University has published Southwest Review. University presses publish many works, including fiction, that commercial houses reject.
>
> The College Art Association lists over seven hundred art museums at American colleges and universities. Yale, Chicago, Berkeley, Michigan, Howard University, Bob Jones University, and Williams College are among those with the best-known collections, but many smaller institutions fill important niches. They cover areas—such as ethnography, ceramics, or prints—that get crowded out of many larger, nonuniversity museums. They also show many local artists, or artists in special genres, who otherwise might not receive exhibition space.[Russell, John J., and Thomas S. Spencer. 2000. Art on Campus: The College Art Association's Official Guide to American College and University Art Museums and Exhibition Galleries. Monkton, Maryland: Friar's Lantern] College radio stations, and the college tour circuit, are critical to the success of independent rock bands and do much to help musical diversity. A commercial radio station, for instance, might play only five hundred or so songs a year. WHRB-FM, at Harvard University, estimates that it plays seventy thousand to ninety thousand songs a year.
>
> Subsidies to higher education remain significant. In 1995, the United States had over 14 million students enrolled in higher education and approximately 915,000 faculty, spread out over 3,706 institutions. Private schools receive large subsidies; federal direct subsidies to higher education cost $11 billion yearly, with another $18 billion allocated to research support, mostly going to private schools. Federal support alone (not including student loans) accounts for about 14 percent of higher education expenditures. Henry Rosovsky (1990, p. 262) estimates that 20 percent of Harvard's budget comes directly from government funds.[See Arthur Cohen (1998, pp. 292, 393), The 14 percent figure is from Arthur Cohen (1998, p. 394).

>
> If we take the public and private sectors together, National Science Foundation figures from 1995 indicate a total income for “research universities” at slightly over $87 billion. Sixteen billion of this total comes from state and local government appropriations, and $12 billion comes from federal grants and contracts, for slightly less than a third of the total.[59. Cohen and Noll (1998, pp. 36–37). Cohen, Linda R., and Roger G. Noll. 1998. “Universities, Constituencies, and the Role of the States.” In Challenges to Research Universities, edited by Roger G. Noll. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, pp. 31–62 ] Tuition revenue relies heavily on federal and state subsidies. In 2000 federal direct and federally guaranteed loans amounted to about $41 billion, covering more than six million students
>
> Nonprofit universities are tax-exempt, and their charitable benefactors can deduct donations to universities from their taxes. These various tax deductions are estimated to be worth at least $11 billion to universities each year.[Page and Simmons (2000, p. 195).] Historically universities and colleges benefited greatly from the Land Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890. The federal government gave free land to universities with few restrictions. The area of this land was equal to the size of Switzerland, and helped schools such as Cornell, MIT, Yale, and Texas A&M, among others.[Trow (1993, pp. 57–58).]

> "The climate of our culture is changing. Under these new rains, new suns, small things grow great, and what was great grows small; whole species disappear and are replaced." --[Randall Jarrell](!Wikipedia)^["A Sad Heart at the Supermarket", _Daedalus_, vol. 89, no. 2 (Spring 1960)]

The [Amazon Kindle](!Wikipedia) has ignited the [ebook](!Wikipedia) market by providing a [e-ink](!Wikipedia) interface which is visually competitive with paper, and easy access to a remarkable fraction of Amazon's inventory. It's very nice.

The pricing of ebooks is controversial^[["E-books spark battle inside the publishing industry"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/24/AR2009122403326.html), _Washington Post_, 27 December 200]; why should an ebook cost as much as the book? The Kindle's ebooks are small digital files, as opposed to multi-pound slabs of exactingly manufactured wood and cloth[^printing]. The former is delivered wirelessly, while the latter requires globe-spanning transport networks. Surely there is vast overhead for the paper, and ebook prices should reflect their marginal cost of production of 0 cents?

Not many expect ebooks to be priced in cents, since the author expects to be paid a fair bit for her writing, and the publisher expects to be paid for editing & formatting it, and Amazon is there discreetly coughing for its share[^scratch]. So it won't be 0¢, but why not $3 or less?

# The price is not right

In a sense, this is a [very easy](!Wikipedia "Law of supply and demand") question. The right price for ebooks is whatever the market will bear. If $3 is not the right price, then consumers will not buy, and the price will continue to fall until they do.

In another sense, it's a difficult question as some people seem to be thinking in medieval terms with the moral concept of the '[just price](!Wikipedia)', which is inapplicable to books[^just].

## Subsidies

But the presupposition of a discussion of how to ensure a profitable price level mutually acceptable to consumers & corporate publishers is that the publishers *should* survive. That is: if books are not economically sustainable at natural e-book prices (eg. $3), will society be worse off? Should publishers or novelists be subsidized[^subsidy]? Some areas of artistic endeavour seem to try to prove that art is worthless and a joke; it's a little hard to explain some areas of modern or post-modern art[^pomo] in any other way, and who are we to disagree with them? But that's a cheap way out. What about art that is quite serious and aspires to the age-old goals of art?

[^pomo]: The examples are legion; from ["Buying the Concept of Art"](http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=2971) ('Talking Philosophy', _[The Philosophers' Magazine](!Wikipedia)_):

    > "Since I have taught Aesthetics since 1994, little that occurs in the strange world of art surprises me. One of the more recent trends is the selling of the ideas of artists, as opposed to the selling of an actual work of art. For example, [Lawrence Weiner put a $160,000 price tag on his idea  of "2 Metal Balls + 2 Metal Rings (Set Down in the Groove)."](http://www.newsweek.com/2011/06/26/collectors-who-spend-thousands-on-artist-s-ideas.html) For the $160,000 you do not get any balls, rings or a groove. Rather, you would receive a certificate that permits you to write the phrase in a room or create/commission the sculpture that you think it happens to describe.
    >
    > Works, if that term can be used, were also sold by Sol LeWitt before his death. While he did create art objects, he also created "works" that were just vague instructions for creating a piece. For example, "Alternate Yellow Ink and Pencil Straight, Parallel Lines, of Random Length, Not Touching the Sides."
    >
    > Tino Sehgal tops both DeWitt and Weiner. Sehgal does not even offer a certificate or set of instructions, he apparently just makes odd things occur and permits no recording of the event. These "works" are sold for cash in front of witnesses, but no documentation is provided. One of his "works", which was purchased for around $100,000 is the concept of a museum security guard slowly undressing. Naturally, the money does not buy an actual security guard or an undressing, merely the concept as put forth by Sehgal."

    Or ["Woman Pays $10,000 For 'Non-Visible' Work Of Art"](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/07/22/138513048/woman-pays-10-000-for-non-visible-work-of-art):

    > "Franco and Praxis also warn that, "When you contribute to this Kickstarter project, you are not buying a visible piece of art!" Yes, after contributing real money, buyers will not receive *any* tangible piece of art and will instead be presented with a written description of their purchase. With prices ranging from $1000 to $10,000, you might ask yourself, "who would actually willingly donate money for pretty much nothing?" Answer: Montreal web producer, social media marketer, model and actor Aimee Davison."

    Davison's [explanation](http://www.onehundredjobs.ca/2011/06/rise-of-social-media-art.html) is at least somewhat sensible:

    > "Also, I wanted to note that I bought Franco et al's art because I want to promote the benefits of bigger brands sponsoring new media artists and social media art (or Internet projects).  My patronage is funding Franco's project but it is equally a sponsorship; it is a marketing tool to publicize my own projects. Sponsoring a social media art project allows a brand or individual to attach their name to a project wherever it appears online, co-create, gain agency and credibility in the social media sphere and share in the buzz, audience, and cultural impact of a work."

The more I think about it, the harder I find justifying any subsidy.

We value high author royalties because this allows authors to specialize in being authors; specialization is a good thing because it allows authors to produce more than they otherwise would; and higher production is good because we value the fruits thereof.

But higher production isn't always good; production can be misguided or wasted ^[cf. [broken window fallacy](!Wikipedia)]. (And strengthened copyright law may not be an effective subsidy regardless.[^strength])

[^strength]: The academic literature is mixed; for example, some find little to no detrimental effect to Internet-borne copyright infringement: <http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/06/file-sharing-has-weakened-copyrightand-helped-society.ars> From ["File-Sharing and Copyright"](http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/09-132.pdf), Oberholzer-Gee & Strumpf 2010:

    > "Data on the supply of new works are consistent with our argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers.^2^ The publication of new books rose by 66% over the 2002-2007 period. Since 2000, the annual release of new music albums has more than doubled, and worldwide feature film production is up by more than 30% since 2003. At the same time, empirical research in file sharing documents that consumer welfare increased substantially due to the new technology."


# 100 apples in the barrel

> "Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,\
> For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain." --William Shakespeare^[[_King Richard II_](!Wikipedia "Richard II (play)")]

Suppose we all have 100 apples. Our lives do not revolve around apples, though we like them well enough. But still, 100 is too many; even if we ate 5 a day, the rest would go bad before we ate them. And of course, it's unlikely that any of us will go to the greengrocers and buy *more*. Our [marginal utility](!Wikipedia) of apples has plunged to zero^[Or below; I dislike clutter.].

From our perspective, the farmer bringing a truck of apples to the greengrocers has wasted his labor. Let's hope he'll find *something* to do with those surplus apples so the resources that went into making them were not wasted - maybe bake some apple pies, or compost them all.

Now suppose this wasn't a one-time gift. We live in a magic world where everyone gets 100 apples a week. Here the farmer's entire career is wasted. Isn't he wasting his life? He's a smart fellow; no reason he couldn't go do something more useful.

We could invent ways to employ this farmer. Perhaps every week he breaks into everybody's kitchens and steals their apples so they have to buy apples from him. Perhaps he'll run a large marketing campaign to convince everyone that his apples are superior to the magical apples. Perhaps some people get [Granny Smith](!Wikipedia) but really wanted [Red Delicious](!Wikipedia), and he runs an apple-trading hub, filling in deficits with his apples. Perhaps he lives on government subsidy checks & farms apples as a hobby. Or something.

But nevertheless, these apple-farmers represent a [dead-weight loss](!Wikipedia). That's bad.

# 100 books on the shelf

> "Do technology and economic growth create problems? Certainly. But as Maurice Chevalier said about the disadvantages of growing old, consider the alternative.\
> ...if you chose to live in Renaissance Florence you would not be able to enjoy [Cézanne](!Wikipedia) and [Picasso](!Wikipedia). In [Johnson](!Wikipedia "Samuel Johnson")'s London, you would not be able to listen to Beethoven or Brahms. In _La [Belle Époque](!Wikipedia)_, you would not be able to read [Joyce](!Wikipedia "James Joyce") or [Faulkner](!Wikipedia "William Faulkner"). To live in today's world is not only to have access to all the best that has come before, but also to have a breadth and ease of access that is comparably greater than that enjoyed even by our parents, let alone earlier generations." --[Charles Murray](!Wikipedia "Charles Murray (author)"), _[Human Accomplishment](!Wikipedia)_

Now, can we apply this analogy? I don't have 100 apples, but perhaps I have - 100 novels.

Not any novels, but [science fiction](!Wikipedia) novels. Nor any 100 Sci-Fi novels, but the winners of the 2 most prestigious SF awards for the last 50 years: the [Hugo](!Wikipedia "Hugo Award") and [Nebula Award](!Wikipedia)s.

## Reading them

> "Time destroys the groundless conceits of men; it confirms decisions founded on reality." --[Cicero](!Wikipedia)^[_De Natura Deorum_, Bk II.2]

Suppose I read the 100 at the rate of 1 a week[^rate], or 52 a year. I will finish them in ~2 years.[^npr]

[^npr]: Another writer (Linda Holmes, ["The Sad, Beautiful Fact That We're All Going To Miss Almost Everything"](http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/21/135508305/the-sad-beautiful-fact-that-were-all-going-to-miss-almost-everything), _NPR_) considers if you read *2* a week:

    > "If we assume you start now, and you're 15, and you are willing to continue at this pace until you're 80. That's 6,500 books, which really sounds like a lot. Let's do you another favor: Let's further assume you limit yourself to books from the last, say, 250 years. Nothing before 1761. This cuts out giant, enormous swaths of literature, of course, but we'll assume you're willing to write off thousands of years of writing in an effort to be reasonably well-read.
    >
    > Of course, by the time you're 80, there will be 65 more years of new books, so by then, you're dealing with 315 years of books, which allows you to read about 20 books from each year. You'll have to break down your 20 books each year between fiction and nonfiction – you have to cover history, philosophy, essays, diaries, science, religion, science fiction, westerns, political theory ... I hope you weren't planning to go out very much...We could do the same calculus with film or music or, increasingly, television – you simply have no chance of seeing even most of what exists. Statistically speaking, you will die having missed almost everything."

It will take an appreciable fraction of my life to read a vanishingly small fraction of one small fiction genre, that itself has existed for less than 2 centuries and been written almost exclusively in 2 countries[^geo].

And what if I want to read the prequels and sequels? Not all winners are as prolific in sequels & prequels as _[Dune](!Wikipedia "Dune universe")_, but these winners include many duologies and trilogies (or more)[^sequels]. I can probably expect to lose another 2 or 6 years to them. Certainly, I can expect it to take another 4 years to read the 2 top runner-ups for each award. And did I mention that these awards have multiple categories? Many of SF's greatest works are short stories or novellas, which compete for different Nebula & Hugo awards.

And of course, it's not like the Hugo & Nebula awards are the definitive list of SF 'books to read' - _[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction](!Wikipedia)_ treats of hundreds of writers, and mentions thousands of works; _[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy](!Wikipedia)_ has more than 4000 entries. The more thoroughly I search, the longer my reading list becomes.

## New = bad

> "It is worth serious consideration how great an amount of time -- their own and other people's -- and of paper is wasted by this swarm of mediocre poets, and how injurious their influence is. For the public always seizes on what is new, and shows even more inclination to what is perverse and dull, as being akin to its own nature. These works of the mediocre, therefore, draw the public away and hold it back from genuine masterpieces, and from the education they afford. Thus they work directly against the benign influence of genius, ruin taste more and more, and so arrest the progress of the age." --[Arthur Schopenhauer](!Wikipedia)^[_[The World as Will and Representation](!Wikipedia)_, section 51, footnote 41]

The list is now 8 years in length; if the SF industry had imploded the day I started, I would not have noticed.

I would be better off, actually, if the industry *did* implode! The last SF or Fantasy I read was [Brandon Sanderson](!Wikipedia)'s _[Mistborn](!Wikipedia "Mistborn series")_ trilogy. It was good, but I know there are better. My reading time is finite, and reading _Mistborn_ pushed out reading [Gene Wolfe](!Wikipedia)'s _[Book of the Long Sun](!Wikipedia)_ tetralogy - which I ultimately enjoyed more. If the industry had imploded before _Mistborn_ was published, I would have read _Long Sun_ instead.

It wouldn't be difficult to spend the rest of my life reading only SF published before 2009, and it would be more efficient as time is the keenest critic.

The connection to other aspects of modern life and _[akrasia](!Wikipedia)_ is apparent: there's a [Gresham's Law](!Wikipedia) whereby cheap yet unsatisfying works will push out more satisfying but more demanding entertainment. Humans suffer from [hyperbolic discounting](!Wikipedia); we may know that in the long run, _Mistborn_ will be forgotten when _Long Sun_ is remembered, and that once we get started, we will enjoy it more - yet when the moment comes to choose, we prefer the choice of immediate pleasure.

### Generalizing this

> "Reading anything less than 50 years old is like drinking new wine: permissible once or twice a year and usually followed by regret and a headache....I definitely have followed that dictum. Maybe a little too much so, in that I rarely read anything modern at all. When it comes to books. I don't follow that rule when it comes to music or movies or blogs. But on the level of books, there is so much good stuff out there that has stood the test of time, I don't run out of interesting things to read." --topologist [Robert Ghrist](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~ghrist/)^[["Applied topology and Dante: an interview with Robert Ghrist"](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/09/13/applied-topology-and-dante-an-interview-with-robert-ghrist/), John D. Cook 13 September 2010.]

But reading only SF is impoverishing. I always wanted to get into mysteries and French literature. But those will take at least 2 decades. Now I'm in my 50s. I'd better hurry if I ever want to read English or Chinese literature, or any nonfiction!

So, why do I care what happens to the SF market? How does it concern me that the short story magazines are collapsing and will train no new writers? I have no need of them. I already have 100 apples.

### Music

Or how about the genre of classical music? I once saw a complete collection of [J.S. Bach](!Wikipedia) in 160 CDs. I've no idea how many hours of music that is, and am too frightened to calculate it. And how many listens would it take to reasonably appreciate it? A lifetime perhaps.

Why should I care about some publisher trying to record another CD of the [Brandenburg Concertos](!Wikipedia)? I'm not a conductor, I will hear no improvement. To me, there is no difference between the world's greatest violinist and the 10^th^-greatest.

### Movies

Or consider another medium: movies. Have you seen the [IMDB](!Wikipedia "Internet Movie Database")'s [Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top) movies? There are excellent movies in there. Some are profound, others moving, and not a few profoundly moving. Why are you going to watch _[Transformers 2](!Wikipedia "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen")_ or _[Ice Age 3](!Wikipedia "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs")_? For entertainment value? But there are movies in that list which are far more entertaining, I assure you.

Even if you've seen the top 50, there's another 200 to choose from. If you think the IMDB is too faddish and Internet-centric, there's no shortage of other lists - the _New York Times_ would be happy to tell you all about ["The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made"](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html) (6 years at 3 movies a week). And what about television? If we ask IMDB about *all* the movies and TV episodes it knows about, it's [happy to tell us](http://www.imdb.com/stats): 1,111,244 episodes; 263,524 movies; and 1,920,757 works in total (as of 28 June 2011). We can also look at movie [production over time](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/datasets/imdb-number-of-movies-by-genre-per-y/versions/1.txt), where we find that as early as 1917 there were 5,490 movies made. So even if we got in at the beginning, we never had a chance at watching so much as a small fraction.

### Genres in general

> "When will we realize that the fact that we can become accustomed to anything, however disgusting at first, makes it necessary to examine carefully everything we have become accustomed to?" --George Bernard Shaw^[_A Treatise on Parents and Children_, 1910]

Any field over a century old has built up a stock of masterpieces that could fill a lifetime.[^moretti]

[^moretti]: This seems to go unrecognized sometimes in literary fields, with its close attention to the rare landmarks of literary history; [Franco Moretti](!Wikipedia) remarks in pg 3-4 of _Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History_ (2005):

     > "...what a minimal fraction of the literary field we all work on: a canon of two hundred novels, for instance, sounds very large for nineteenth-century Britain (and is much larger than the current one), but is still less than 1% of the novels that were actually published: twenty thousand, thirty, more, no one really knows—and close reading won't help here, a novel a day every day of the year would take a century or so."

Fields that are new, or still technically developing, may not have enough. For example, video games - even the greatest arcade games from 20 or 30 years ago such as _[Pac-Man](!Wikipedia)_ or _[Space Invaders](!Wikipedia) has a hard time competing against mediocre contemporary games.

But even new genres have problems with the general surplus of art. After all, while we may not be able divide up all art into categories of 'painting' or 'Russian novel', there is something we *can* count and which is absolutely crucial to the argument: time. Our lives are only so long, and they are denominated quite precisely, second by second. We have 500,000 hours^[$\text{total hours} - \text{sleeping hours}$, or, $80 \text{years} \times 365 \text{days} \times 24 \text{hours} = 700800$; $700800 - (\frac{1}{3} \times 700800) = 467200$].

Does it matter whether it's a ballet or a novel if we devote 3 of those hours to it? Artworks may be as non-commodified or incomparable or subjective as we please, but we can't get around our own limits. For our finite lives, it's good enough if we call it art. And we don't necessarily need to assume substitution of works *across* genres; given enough time, any genre will outrun your lifespan. As genres multiply, it becomes ever more difficult to argue that some new and small genre is the only one that can satisfy one and that it merits subsidy. (And yet, despite the scarcity of our attention, we fritter it away and value our time at next to nothing: someone watching an hour of TV is so worthless that after nearly a century, the most an advertiser can afford to pay the TV station for that person's attention is [20 cents](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2011/03/your_attention.php).)

## Media shock

> "The soul has no assignments, neither cooks\
> Nor referees: it wastes its time. It wastes its time.\
> Here in this enclave there are centuries\
> For you to waste...\
> The books, just leafed through, whisper endlessly." --Randal Jarrell^["A Girl in a Library", lines 32-29; _The Seven-League Crutches_]

I hope I've made my point: we live in an age of *utter* media abundance. Like none before us, we can partake of the greatest works in all mediums of all ages. We do not sip from a fountain laboriously supplied by hard-working artists & authors, nor even guzzle from a fire-hose hooked up to a printing press; we are being shot off Niagara Falls. The impact alone will kill us.

This has been true for a very long time. Even mediums dismissed as dead produce astounding quantities; the American magazine [_Poetry_](!Wikipedia "Poetry (magazine)") receives [100,000 poem submissions](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-0621-focus-poetry-foundation-20110620,0,1984480,full.story) a year. The [Bodleian Library](!Wikipedia) has been running out of space since the 1970s; it ordered a 13-acre warehouse with 153 miles of high-density shelving - and expects this to suffice for just 20 years^[["Vast bookstore opens as famed library runs out of space"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11484494), _BBC News_, 6 October 2010]. This abundance may not have been obvious before the Internet. The largest collection a person would ever run into would be his local library, and that is reassuringly small. It has a few dozen thousand volumes, perhaps, of which someone will want to read only a small fraction. A good reader could get through 1 book a day on average, and so one *could* encompass the whole in a lifetime. Who visits the Library of Congress and is struck by the physical reality of dozens of millions of items? No one. ([Google Books](!Wikipedia) estimates there are >[130 million](http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html) books.) One couldn't hope to buy more than one could consume either, as books and media are expensive per hour. (Niche consumer can expect even worse prices; at one point, American anime fans were paying more than $40 for <30 minutes^[Nor was this the extreme for that period. ["Remember when you had to pay 50 bucks for a two-episode VHS tape from Japan, plus shipping? Or, shudder, a hundred dollars to import a LaserDisc for a two-episode OAV that turned out to be total garbage? Those were dark times, my friend."](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2011-02-25) (_Anime News Network_)].)

But the Internet puts the equivalent of multiple Libraries of Congresses at one's fingertips. One only has to visit a BitTorrent tracker website and see the entries scroll off the screen for hundreds of pages, each representing a massive collection soaking up endless weeks and years. All of it is there for the taking. It can't be ignored. Everyone who wants a particular webpage or album or movie is forced to see the results of their search queries and muse, 'if my narrow request turned up *this* much - how much must there be in all?' The numbers become numbing if one projects out just a little way into the future:

> "So far humans have created 500,000 different movies and about one million TV episodes. At least 11 million different songs have been recorded...If the current rates of inventiveness continue, in 2060 there will be 1.1 billion[^albums] unique songs and 12 billion different kinds of products for sale."^[pg 281 of Kevin Kelly's _[What Technology Wants](!Wikipedia)_ (2011).]

[^albums]: Not unreasonable a figure, given how many albums and other works are released every year; from Oberholzer-Gee & Strumpf 2010:

    > "While album sales have generally fallen since 2000, the number of albums being created has exploded. In 2000, 35,516 albums were released. Seven years later, 79,695 albums (including 25,159 digital albums) were published (Nielsen SoundScan, 2008).
    >
    > Similar trends can be seen in other creative industries. For example, the worldwide number of feature films produced each year has increased from 3,807 in 2003 to 4,989 in 2007 (Screen Digest, 2004 and 2008). Countries where film piracy is rampant have typically increased production. This is true in South Korea (80 to 124), India (877 to 1164), and China (140 to 402). During this period, U.S. feature film production has increased from 459 feature films in 2003 to 590 in 2007 (MPAA, 2007)."

1.1 billion unique songs beggars the imagination. When I was a child, I would sometimes see how high I could count before I lost track, mentally counting in a blur; over a periods of many months, occasionally writing down the current number before bedtime, I managed to count to 2 million. The numbers began to appall me - ever since I have never seen the word 'number' without seeing 'numb' in it. But 2 million is tiny. It is barely $\frac{1}{600}$ of the raw numerical count of songs that I will live to see produced.

Even individual sites or writers now surpass the human. Who has the time to read and understand all of [Donald Knuth](!Wikipedia)?[^knuth] Who can view every article and document and photograph and edit that streams through Wikipedia every second? I have seen sober estimates that if one were to start at the first Wikipedia article and read alphabetically, the percentage of Wikipedia one has read will go down over time, the articles were created so fast. Who can watch the [35 hours](http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/11/great-scott-over-35-hours-of-video.html) of video uploaded to YouTube every minute?

[^knuth]: From his [2006 interview](https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006):

    > "As you can see from my comments that I'm addicted to writing, I love the idea of communicating ideas to other people. I think, in every case, the books that I've written were things where I had learned about some phenomenon that I thought was just too good to keep to myself and so I wanted other people to share in the joy of reading it. So it turns out then that I have more than 20 books in print now and that's, you know, so many that I doubt that there's anybody in the world who's read more than half of them. And I sometimes think what tragedy it would be if there were ten people in the world like me because we wouldn't have time to read each other's books, you know, it doesn't scale up."

This is a situation that old nostrums do not address. We do not need more creativity for the sake of creation^[See also Robin Hanson's brief essay. ["The Myth Of Creativity: Innovation matters, but releasing your inner bohemian isn't the answer"](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_27/b3991115.htm)].

# Let's ban new books

> "Consequently, it is soon recognised that they write for the sake of filling up the paper, and this is the case sometimes with the best authors... As soon as this is perceived the book should be thrown away, for time is precious. As a matter of fact, the author is cheating the reader as soon as he writes for the sake of filling up paper; because his pretext for writing is that he has something to impart...It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth writing. What an inestimable advantage it would be, if, in every branch of literature, there existed only a few but excellent books!" --Arthur Schopenhauer, ["On Authorship and Style"](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/essays/chapter3.html)

With our too too short lives, and so much to see, one does oneself a great disservice by consuming anything but the best.

And thus, do not authors & artists do us a disservice by creating mediocrity we, being only human, will at least try? Maybe these authors & artists are only creating [attractive nuisance](!Wikipedia)s!

Let's look back on the argument:

1. Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.\
    At least, it ought not to encourage inefficiency. It may not do this perfectly, but this is still a desiderata; special pleading for some activity, saying that some other activity or market is far more economically inefficient, is not a good reason.
2. If some good _a_ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing & available good _b_ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use _a_ and not _b_.
3. Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.
4. By 2 & 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.

∴ By 1 & 4: Society ought to discourage new art

In short: old stuff is as good as the new, and it's cheaper; so making new stuff is wasteful.

## Objections

One of the basic tactics with any objectionable argument is to see whether any of the inference steps are faulty. In this case, we can see that there is nothing wrong with the logic. So we're left with rejecting premises, or accepting the conclusion.

Here's what we can reject:

1. that societies ought to encourage efficiency
2. that creating something when there's an existing object is inefficient
3. that old books can replace new ones.

### Society doesn't care?

Now, #1 seems unobjectionable. To reject that premise is to argue either that society ought to discourage economic efficiency, or be neutral about efficiency.

The former is obviously false. There are governmental programs and policies acknowledged to be economically inefficient, but everyone agrees that their inefficiency is a flaw, and the programs are justifiable not because of, but despite the inefficiency - they supposedly deliver some other benefit which compensates for the cost. If there were some alternative which was efficient, it would be better.

Neutrality is not so obviously wrong. But voters consistently elect candidates who promise to grow the economy & make things better; and governments have a long history of supporting projects - like bridges & highways - whose justifications are that government ought to help make the economy more efficient. So it seems wrong as well.

### What's efficiency anyway?

Premise #2 is weaker. To me, this premise about substitutability seems so obvious that I'm not sure how to defend it. If you need a glove, and you have a perfectly good one already, isn't spending $20 on a new glove the same thing as throwing your money away? Isn't #2 a generalization of this obvious fact?

If you reject #2, I'm not really sure what economics you're working under. But there are a few objections we could classify under this heading, generally postulating [externalities](!Wikipedia), such as Keynesian thinking about stimulus spending.

#### They Snatched Society's Brain!

> "By this, my sonne, be admonished: of making many bookes there is no end, and much studie is a wearinesse of the flesh." --_Ecclesiastes_ 12:12

An interlocutor might suggest that perhaps the creation & consumption of new fiction or novels serves some laudable purpose beyond swelling libraries.

Now, what good deeds could only *new* works produce? Certainly it's not edifying & educating our youth; it is not as if the pedagogy of Euclidean geometry has changed much over the last millennia, nor is 20th century fiction known for teaching moral lessons.

But new fiction could be an important societal mechanism for discussing new developments and for pondering the future. SF would be an excellent example of this; the name preferred by connoisseurs - '[speculative fiction](!Wikipedia)' - points straight to this benefit, and creators often cite this as the non-entertainment value of their works[^sleepdealer]. Who but knows that the constant undercurrent of computers & cloning & space travel in SF has not helped society prepare for the future? Hasn't SF directly inspired any number of young men & women to enter the hard sciences (as opposed to dedicating their talents to, say, finance), with benefits redounding to all humanity? What's a dead-weight loss of billions a year compared with landing on the Moon?

I find this argument uncomfortable. It's arguing that fiction is justified inasmuch as it makes superior propaganda[^propaganda]. It may be propaganda in the service of a noble & good cause, and swaying someone to choose a career in science is not as evil as propagandizing children into clearing Iraqi minefields with their bodies - but the morality of it is difficult.

And a utilitarian might cavil about the benefits. Fiction can be unfairly persuasive, bypassing our rational faculties[^hanson]. (SF is often good inversely proportional to how much scientific truth it contains.) The author's motive may be malign as easily as benign.

As a society, is it *good* to have our discussions and views about incredibly important matters like space exploration hijacked by fiction? It's hard to see why fiction would yield discussion of equal or superior quality to discussions based on non-fiction. [Fictional evidence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/) is particularly fallacious. Consider discussions of [Artificial Intelligence](!Wikipedia); if one sees any mention of fictional entities like [HAL 9000](!Wikipedia) or [Skynet](!Wikipedia "Skynet (Terminator)"), one can stop reading immediately, for the exchange is surely worthless. A discussion about the nonfictional entities [SHRDLU](!Wikipedia) or [Eurisko](!Wikipedia), though, might be worthwhile.

So either fiction is effective as propaganda and setting societal agendas, or it isn't. If the latter, then the loss is nil; if the former, then fiction is dangerous!

#### Two sides of the same organ

> "Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And that means the old books...Nothing strikes me more when I read the controversies of past ages than the fact that both sides were usually assuming without question a good deal which we should now absolutely deny. They thought that they were as completely opposed as two sides could be, but in fact they were all the time secretly united-united with each other and against earlier and later ages-by a great mass of common assumptions....None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it, and weaken our guard against it, if we read only modern books." --[C.S. Lewis](!Wikipedia)^[his [Introduction](http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/athanasius/incarnation/incarnation.p.htm) to _The Incarnation of the Word of God_]

Maybe there's a different externality. Instead of powering decision-making, or funneling people into science, maybe fiction serves as kind of a global brain - enabling creative thinking and breakthroughs that a more sober society will not.

This thesis reminds me of the [Orson Welles](!Wikipedia) quote from _[The Third Man](!Wikipedia)_ that goes:

> "...in Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace—and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."^[On the other hand, Switzerland is, adjusted for size, one of the [most scientifically prolific](http://mangans.blogspot.com/2009/07/scientific-impact-of-nations.html) countries in the world. [Albert Einstein](!Wikipedia) was a Swiss citizen, incidentally.]

The evidence for this idea might be that every great scientific or technological power was also strong in the humanities, and exceptions like Soviet Russia only prove the rule by creating scientific enclaves mimicking the freer countries.

But of course, this might be confusing correlation with causation. What characterizes those countries is a general freedom of action & thought. Some incline to the arts, some to the sciences. Successes in both domains spring from a common cause, not each other. After all, if the arts could fertilize the sciences, one would expect some reciprocity - and the humanities have made [notoriously little use](!Wikipedia "The Two Cultures")^[And while the situation has gotten better since C.P. Snow's day, can we really say there's so much cross-fertilization as to prove this externality, or prove it of sufficient magnitude?] of science's techniques, worldview, or results.

Conceptually, I see no problem with a nation of sober hard-headed engineers and scientists doing quite as well without the novelists.

If we think of specifics, the idea of cross-fertilization retreats. What Elizabethan plays helped Isaac Newton? When Einstein thought of riding a beam of light, did the novels of Thomas Mann play any role? What hath [Stephen King](!Wikipedia) to do with [Stephen Hawking](!Wikipedia)?

#### Won't someone think of the chemists?

One could worry that the failure of fiction markets to find a sustainable model might mean the end for nonfiction material, which includes texts & research on things precious to us all such as vaccines.

After all, many of the same arguments seem to apply to the flood of nonfiction material. [ProQuest](!Wikipedia)'s database includes 1.023 million PhD theses published in the last 30 years from just 151 American institutions;^[See ["Which universities lead and lag? Toward university rankings based on scholarly output"](http://www.stanford.edu/~dramage/papers/universities-nips10.pdf), Ramage 2010.] and it says [says](http://www.proquest.com/en-US/products/dissertations/) that its full database of PhD and Masters' theses runs to over 2 million, and is increasing at more than 70,000 works a year. Much of this material would seem to be sterile and unproductive, as can be scientific papers in general.^[Various disciplines have many papers and essays arguing that researchers deliberately inflate their paper counts to meet publishing requirements<!-- http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/decline.htm -->, pursue unproductive but publishable avenues, and are so lacking in rigor that many (or even [most](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)) results are wrong - so it would be difficult to offer any citations for such a broad claim. Mencius Moldbug has written a meandering & funny essay/blog post about [what is wrong with the field of computer science](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/whats-wrong-with-cs-research.html), however, that conveys this general vein of thought.][^citation][^smallnumbers]

[^citation]: One way of trying to measure productivity per researcher is to examine what experts/researchers in that area consider worth citing and discussing. Charles Murray examines encyclopedias and biographical dictionaries up to 1950 in _[Human Accomplishment](!Wikipedia)_ and finds, once one corrects for the explosive growth of the human population in recent centuries and the even more explosive growth in urbanized educated people, a decline.

    Less historically, one can simply look at how many published peer-reviewed papers go uncited for 5 years. If a paper is not cited once in that period, even just as part of a review, then one begins to wonder whether it is a good paper, and if a field publishes a lot of such papers, one begins to wonder about that field's researchers. There are many interesting statistics in this vein. From ["The Rise and Fall of Uncitedness"](http://crl.acrl.org/content/58/1/19.full.pdf), by Charles A. Schwartz

    > "...55% of scientific articles do not receive a single citation within five years of publication. A few weeks later, another report in Science by the same research body, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), noted still higher rates of uncitedness for the social sciences (75%) and humanities (92%)....Among the new findings eventually produced, but not published, was the rate of uncitedness in library and information science (LIS). This rate turned out to be 72%."
    >
    > ...The popular press treated this issue with cavalier remarks, such as one attributed to a professor: ["If the bottom 80% of the literature just vanished, I doubt if the scientific enterprise would suffer."](http://www.newsweek.com/1991/01/13/gridlock-in-the-labs.html)'
    >
    > ...Against ISI's initial 55% uncitedness rate for the physical sciences, one study found a 5% rate for astronomy and an 8% rate for physics. And against ISI's initial 75% uncitedness rate for the social sciences, another study found a 9% rate for sociology."

    There are quite a range of uncited estimates; to give just some ranges that particularly struck me, even after making allowance for all the possible confounding factors:

    - physical sciences: 55-14%
        1. 72-34% engineering
        2. 55-26% math
        3. chemistry: 28% (nuclear chemistry 17%; applied chemistries: 78%)
    - social: 75-48%
        1. international relations 83-53%
        2. political science 90-58%
    - humanities: 98-93%
        1. theater, American literature, architecture 99-95%
        2. religious studies 98-93%

    It doesn't seem likely to improve, as institutions continue to allocate tenure and funding based on metrics like [impact factor](http://www.int-res.com/articles/esep2008/8/e008p009.pdf). From ["We Must Stop the Avalanche of Low-Quality Research"](http://chronicle.com/article/We-Must-Stop-the-Avalanche-of/65890/), _[The Chronicle of Higher Education](!Wikipedia)_:

    > "Consider this tally from _Science_ two decades ago: Only 45 percent of the articles published in the 4,500 top scientific journals were cited within the first five years after publication. In recent years, the figure seems to have dropped further. In [a 2009 article](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1796008&show=abstract) in _Online Information Review_, Péter Jacsó found that 40.6 percent of the articles published in the top science and social-science journals (the figures do not include the humanities) were cited in the period 2002 to 2006."

[^smallnumbers]: Nor are papers/articles the only scholarly productions which have extremely small audiences; conferences and monographs do not draw very many participants. From ["University Presses: Balancing Academic and Market Values"](http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/up.pdf), Mary M. Case; _ARL: A Bimonthly Report_ no. 193 (August 1997):

    > "Since libraries are the main market for scholarly monographs, the decline in the number of books purchased triggered university presses to reduce print runs. While print-runs of 1,000 to 1,500 copies were standard ten years ago, presses are now confronting sales of 400-500 copies. While sales do vary across disciplines and sub-disciplines, these low numbers hold true for even award-winning books in the less 'popular' fields."

    ["Reflections on University Press Publishing"](http://www.academicmatters.ca/current_issue.article.gk?catalog_item_id=2423), Bill Harnum:

    > "The numbers are hard to quantify, given the wide variety of subject areas involved, but a fair estimate would be that the average sale of a scholarly monograph has shrunk from 600-700 copies in the 1980s to 300-400 copies in 2007. This reduction in sales units has led some publishers to increase their number of titles published annually as a means of maintaining their revenues. The phrase, "Flat is the new up" seems to be in vogue, meaning that no sales increase from year to year is the equivalent of the increases we have seen in the past."

    Dr. [Alex Reid](http://www.alex-reid.net/vita-1.html), ["On the value of academic blogging"](http://www.alex-reid.net/2011/03/on-the-value-of-academic-blogging.html):

    > "In my experience, the average audience for a conference presentation is <20."

But this worry is unnecessary. There are several possibilities.

The nonfiction market *could* be subsidized. This is quite justifiable. Science, after all, is heavily subsidized already. Why? Because it has enormous value ^[How much economic growth since the Middle Ages has been due to science & technology, and not solely increased population & resource exploitation? Most of the growth...] and new research can't be replaced by old, almost by definition. There's intrinsic value to populating new chapters and books with new results, value that isn't there with fiction.

The nonfiction market could survive as the fiction market withers away. Fields might lose the subsidy of students forced to buy the latest trivially-changed edition, but that's a predatory subsidy and more valuable to the publishers than the academic authors, so the loss would be minimal.

### Accept no substitutes, or, I can't believe it's not Octavia Butler

The claim of #3 is that we can, without loss, switch everyone over from reading contemporary fiction to not-so-contemporary fiction. I daresay this is the premise everyone will question immediately. The classics are an essential part of an intellectually balanced breakfast, but can they be all of it?

In many respects, much of fiction is worthless. For example, the medieval Japanese believed that _[The Tale of Genji](!Wikipedia)_ was missing several chapters. Suppose this were true? How exactly has the world been harmed? People seem to enjoy _Genji monogatari_ quite well enough. Would the discovery of 3 or 4 concluding chapters *improve* the work? Clearly it would lead to a great deal of work being done, since textbooks and papers would have to be updated, but how likely is it that the extra chapters will make _Genji_ a greater work? _Genji_ isn't the most tightly plotted work. If an act were cut out of _[Macbeth](!Wikipedia)_, it would be a poorer play for it, and many poems would suffer for losing a stanza; but plays and poems are usually written with an eye to performance - there's a premium on length that isn't there with novels. Consider [Charles Dickens](!Wikipedia)'s _[The Pickwick Papers](!Wikipedia)_. If 100 pages dropped right out of the middle, do you think any new readers would notice? Or if a few heroic hexameters dropped out of the _[Iliad](!Wikipedia)_, would our enjoyment be any less? 'Even Homer nods'; it is the entire work that is valuable.

People might *say* that they would derive much less enjoyment from an incomplete, edited, or abridged version, but I don't know how much we can trust such utterances. They might just be making a ritual genuflection to the eminent author, or upholding a social image as a person who cares about accuracy, completeness, and authenticity. If we can't, if there is some ceiling of _n_ utilons of enjoyment which is reached by many books, then premise #3 is saved.

But can we assume that there's a common valuation for how enjoyable all books are? _[Moby Dick](!Wikipedia)_ is quite different from _[The Importance of Being Earnest](!Wikipedia)_. Alice may value the former much less than the latter, while Bob wants a nautical drama & not a comedy of manners. In this case, because both works exist, both Alice & Bob can be satisfied and we reach an optimum.

But what if the book Bob desires hasn't been published, but would be soon if there were a market? He will be saddened to have to read of butlers and harpooners instead of the shadow war of [Pirates versus Ninjas](!Wikipedia). In this binary case, Alice will still be fine, but Bob will be worse off.

The full example is not so bad for us, though. It's plausible that Bob would enjoy _Pirates vs. Ninja: The Stabbening_ more than _Moby Dick_ if those were the only 2 choices. But there are over 32 million books in the [Library of Congress](!Wikipedia); is Bob so extraordinarily picky that not a single existing book would be as or more enjoyable than PvN?

This is not so implausible; American culture stagnated in many ways during the 20th century. The economist [Tyler Cowen](!Wikipedia) [considers](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/08/what-if-culture-froze.html) a reader's thought experiment:

> "...what if the law said we couldn't make any new art (movies, novels, music etc). And perhaps said we ought to rerelease each year the art that first appeared 50 or 30 years ago. How would people's leisure activity and society's cultural evolution change?"

And replies ^[Links as in original.]:

> "After the adjustment process, I believe that matters would settle in an orderly fashion, although whether we pick the art from 30 or 50 years ago would make a big difference in terms of the required rejiggling of our aesthetic sensibilities.  We would pick out [bestsellers from 30 or 50 years ago](http://greatpenformances.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/1959-bestselling-novels/) and some of them would be in demand, if only because people wish to share common cultural experiences.  Overall it is the more obscure books from that era that would likely rise to be the bestsellers today.\
> 1979 is barely an aesthetic leap; could not _The Clash_ be a hit today?  How about Madonna?  Is it so ridiculous to think that people still might go hear _The Rolling Stones_ or Paul McCartney in concert?"

In the same vein, [John Taylor](!Wikipedia "John Taylor (bass guitarist)") ([bassist](!Wikipedia) for _[Duran Duran](!Wikipedia)_), who is unhappy with the "slow down"^[He is not the only one diagnosing this slowdown; see composer [Glenn Branca](!Wikipedia)'s ["The Score: The End of Music"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/the-end-of-music/) for another lament.] of "innovative culture" (and music in particular), admits that:

> "Most students I know have an extremely broad appreciation of music....
> My stepson is at New York University (NYU) and he was telling me how he's currently into Cole Porter, music from the 1920s and swing music from the 40s. So the availability and accessibility of music on the internet today is truly incredible, and I applaud anything that can inspire interest or curiosity in anyone.\
> But this also means that those of us who before would have been looking towards the current culture for inspiration are now often to be found, like my stepson, in various backwaters of older music.\
> This relative lack of need for current, innovative culture can cause, has caused, is causing - maybe - the innovative culture to slow down, much as an assembly line in Detroit slows down and lay-offs have to be made when the demand for a new model recedes."^[["Is the internet stifling new music?"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8347178.stm), 9 November 2009, _BBC News_]

Pejorative language aside ([Cole Porter](!Wikipedia) is a backwater?), does Taylor's grandson sound unhappy with old music? Would he be unhappy if his choices were universalized and less new music were created as a result?

#### In-progress works

But, you say, [Herbert](!Wikipedia "Frank Herbert") & Wolfe are fine, but dammit you have a hunger for some [Cory Doctorow](!Wikipedia), and can't help but be curious as to how the deuce _The Wheel of Time_ will end. OK, fine. There are ~300 million Americans who couldn't care less if a market dissolution balked you. And of course, the problem of works-in-progress is a problem that solves itself: Doctorow must one day die, and if he shuffles off the mortal coil tomorrow, then your situation was the same as mine - except with a slightly higher upper bound.

And even if you were balked, or in-progress series permitted to finish, that's a fixed one-time cost^[One-time, of course. It's hard to imagine what an on-going cost for in-progress works might be. People dreaming up possible series and being unhappy that they won't be written? But we hardly are concerned by ['ten thousand freaks that died in thinking'](!Wikipedia "Absalom and Achitophel").]. It may cost quite a bit to liquidate all the companies and shift their assets into more productive occupations; some people will never shift. But that's [creative destruction](!Wikipedia) for you: the long-term benefits win in the long run.

#### New book smell

Maybe there's something intrinsically better about new books. Not that they deal with new subjects - we addressed that earlier - but perhaps it's about the style, or appearance, or apparent novelty. Maybe when one looks at _[Tom Jones](!Wikipedia "The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling")_, the antique language instantly subtracts 10 utilons even if it's still comprehensible.

But the language can't be the reason. Maybe Shakespeare and Chaucer aren't as enjoyable and this explains why they aren't as popular as they should be given their eminence, but for this to explain why books from the '50s or '60s are very unpopular or why books from the '00s sell better than books from the '90s - despite them all reading much the same[^language], we need to posit large penalties and attribute to readers remarkable powers of discrimination. (And we could argue that the existing relatively low level of support for new works compared to other forms of recreation like professional sports indicates that new book smell is even less valuable than one might expect just from sales.[^sports])

[^sports]: Professional sports and Olympic sports routinely break world records as they develop ever more effective training & teaching methods, and scour the populace for people capable of historic performance; chess has followed a similar trajectory with [Magnus Carlsen](!Wikipedia) becoming a grandmaster at age 13 & peaking - for now - just below his not-too-distant predecessor (and greatest chess player in history), Garry Kasparov. The Dominican Republic is vastly overrepresented in baseball, demonstrating that there is tremendous latent reserves of world-class baseball players in even tiny populations.

    Baseball statistician & writer [Bill James](!Wikipedia) says in [an excerpt](http://www.slate.com/id/2289380/pagenum/all/) from his book _Solid Fool's Gold: Detours on the Way to Conventional Wisdom_:

    > "I believe that there is a Shakespeare in Topeka today, that there is a Ben Jonson, that there is a Marlowe and a Bacon, most likely, but that we are unlikely ever to know who these people are because our society does not encourage excellence in literature. That's my opinion. This observation is nowhere near as gloomy as it might seem. Our society is very, very good at developing certain types of skills and certain types of genius. We are fantastically good at identifying and developing athletic skills—better than we are, really, at almost anything else. We are quite good at developing and rewarding inventiveness. We are pretty good at developing the skills necessary to run a small business—a fast food restaurant, for example. We're really, really good at teaching people how to drive automobiles and how to find a coffee shop.
    >
    > We are not so good at developing great writers, it is true, but why is this? It is simply because we don't need them. We still have Shakespeare. We still have Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson; their books are still around. We don't genuinely need more literary geniuses. One can only read so many books in a lifetime. We need new athletes all the time because we need new games every day—fudging just a little on the definition of the word need. We like to have new games every day, and, if we are to have a constant and endless flow of games, we need a constant flow of athletes. We have gotten to be very, very good at developing the same.
    >
    >...The average city the size of Topeka produces a major league player every 10 or 15 years. If we did the same things for young writers, every city would produce a Shakespeare or a Dickens or at least a Graham Greene every 10 or 15 years. Instead, we tell the young writers that they should work on their craft for 20 or 25 years, get to be really, really good—among the best in the world—and then we'll give them a little bit of recognition."

Could it be due to '[spoilers](!Wikipedia "Spoilers (media)")'? Some spoilers, like King Kong dying or Darth Vader being Luke Skywalker's father, are so universal as to 'spoil' pretty much anyone who would watch those movies. A new work, however, has a long lag before the 'spoilers' escape into the general population, and so if spoilers destroyed the pleasure people take in works, one would naturally expect people to gravitate towards newer works.

While commonly voiced, this suggestion can only be part of the picture. Only the very most prominent works can be spoiled inadvertently; '[Snape killed Dumbledore](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Snape%20killed%20Dumbledore)' or '[Aeris dies](https://www.xkcd.com/299/)' were successful spoiler [memes](!Wikipedia) only because the book and video game (respectively) sold millions of copies and were major cultural events. By definition, there are only a small number of suck works. Perhaps a handful of such books or movies or games would be involuntarily spoiled each year, leaving *thousands* of other new works being produced despite no anti-spoiler advantage. Further, if this were the sole reason for new works, we would have the odd situation that people apparently are willing to spend many billions to encourage production of as-yet-unspoiled works, but will do nothing else to stem the spread of spoilers - even though a [negative externality](!Wikipedia) in the billions calls out for prevention or regulation of some sort. Society quite successfully stems the spread of other categories of undesirable information like private information or information on weapons of mass destruction or child pornography, and spoilers would seem to be far easier to suppress than any existing category of information. Finally, and most damning, the minimal research on the topic of spoilers suggests that the net displeasure caused by spoilers is minimal, and if anything, spoilers actively cause one to enjoy a work more[^lehrer].

[^lehrer]: From [Jonah Lehrer](!Wikipedia)'s ["Spoilers Don't Spoil Anything"](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/), _Wired_: <!-- TODO: shminux claims he listened to a radio interview where one of the researchers said 'people were unhappy to have been given spoilers' http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/episode/2011/08/11/thursday-august-11th-2011/ -->

    > "I've always assumed that this reading style [reading the ending first] is a perverse personal habit, a symptom of a flawed literary intelligence. It turns out, though, that I was just ahead of the curve, because spoilers don't spoil anything. In fact, a new study [upcoming in _Psychological Science_] suggests that spoilers can actually *increase* our enjoyment of literature. Although we've long assumed that the suspense makes the story — we keep on reading because we don't know what happens next — this new research suggests that the tension actually detracts from our enjoyment.
    >
    > The experiment itself was simple: Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego gave several dozen undergraduates 12 different short stories. The stories came in three different flavors: ironic twist stories (such as Chekhov's ["The Bet"](!Wikipedia "The Bet (short story)")), straight up mysteries ("A Chess Problem" by Agatha Christie) and so-called "literary stories" by writers like Updike and Carver. Some subjects read the story as is, without a spoiler. Some read the story with a spoiler carefully embedded in the actual text, as if Chekhov himself had given away the end. And some read the story with a spoiler disclaimer in the preface.
    >
    > ...The first thing you probably noticed is that people don't like literary stories. (And that's a shame, because Updike's "Plumbing" is a masterpiece of prose: "All around us, we are outlasted….") But you might also have noticed that *almost every single story*, regardless of genre, was more pleasurable when prefaced with a spoiler. This suggests that I read fiction the right way, beginning with the end and working backwards. I like the story more because the suspense is contained."

If there is a new book smell, and it can explain why books from the recent past are less popular than new book, then that means it is nothing intrinsic about the books themselves. Which suggests that it's a matter of consumer perception; marketing has a long history of altering consumer perceptions for fun & profit.

If new books ceased to be written, then the publishers of the existing books will have to compete on other grounds, such as price and marketing - which would include faking new book smell. If people are so frequently mistaken about what they would enjoy most now, surely they can be mistaken in the future about new book smell. The modern success of Jane Austen and of lightly edited versions such as _[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies](!Wikipedia)_ demonstrates that the centuries need be no bar.

# At the end of the day

> "There is nothing so absurd but that some philosopher has said it." --[Cicero](!Wikipedia)^[_De Divinatione_, bk. 2, sct. 58]

> "The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, & to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it." --[Bertrand Russell](!Wikipedia)^["The Philosophy of [Logical Atomism](!Wikipedia)"]

> "But I had become aware, even so early as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and incredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on of the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I remarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours are not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary that many of these nations make an equally good, if not better, use of their reason than we do." --[René Descartes](!Wikisource "Discourse on the Method/Part 2")

We've covered quite a bit of ground here. There are a number of different theses I've tried to argue for here:

- There's more fiction then anyone could hope to consume
- People would be happier reading only the best fiction
- It's easier to figure out what the good old fiction is, than it is new fiction
    - there's also more good old fiction than good new fiction
- people write too much new fiction
    - they also read too much
- Society shouldn't subsidize economically inefficient things like new fiction
    -  We might go so far as to suggest a [Pigovian tax](!Wikipedia) on new works because they encourage their own consumption
- The uses of fiction are much less than one might think, and many of those uses are propagandistic, dangerous, or both
- Subsidizing the nonfiction market may be justifiable

I've hope you've been convinced of at least 2 or 3 of these theses. I rather want to reject the idea that new works should be discouraged, but the only class of objections that can hold any water is the non-substitutability one, and I don't see any solid arguments there.

People *are* better off reading the best books, and the best ones are predominately the ones that already exist, there're more than can be read, and new books have no compelling advantage over the classics. The economics place me against new fiction. And when I remember how people are beguiled by new fiction into reading crap, I find myself placed against new fiction on esthetic grounds as well.

I have started with common-sense grounds and wound up somewhere strange.

<!--
 draft

Hm. I've thought a little more about it, and I think it might be possible to get something of value out of this argument: with a different emphasis, we can see it as a _reductio_ against either the idea that esthetic experiences (of art) can be compared or reckoned at all with each other, or the idea that art can have eternal/undiminished esthetic value.

The reductio would go:
- Given a certain set of empirical circumstances, the collection of art available to any human will grow, and keep on growing as artists explore ever new mediums and genres and 'mash up' old works - the Library of Congress never shrinks.
- Given that we won't assume that artistic competence will enter an eternal decline, we can expect the # of works above some absolute level of quality will likewise always grow (ie. as time passes, the # of works greater than Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew_ will only increase)
- Given also that a human's lifespan/capacity-to-experience-aesthetic-experiences is fixed
- we can conclude that: no matter how high a human's standard, there will be a point in history where enough art has been produced that he can spend his *entire* life consuming *only* works above that standard
- at which point, the value of new art drops to zero for him, and per my economic arguments, even have negative values

But it seems absurd that we could ever, under any circumstances, prefer less art to more art, or even only be indifferent between a large collection and a larger (it oughtn't be true that a Library of Congress with 10 billion works == a LoC with 20 billion works). So we might conclude that there is something wrong here.

If we reject the idea that art is eternal in value, then the resolution is obvious: the value of the LoC decays over time, and it needs to be topped up with fresh masterpieces.

-----

Hm. My first reaction is to say, it doesn't matter. After all, while we may not be able to put artworks into neat countable categories, there is something we *can* count and which is absolutely crucial to the argument: time. Our lives are only so long, and they are denominated quite precisely, nanosecond by nanosecond. We only live 50,000 hours, I think the approximation goes. Does it matter whether it's a ballet or a novel if we spend 1 of those hours interacting with or collaborating with it? The art's 'essence' or 'artiness' may be as non-commodified as we please, but we can't get around the limits on ourselves. For our finite lives, it's good enough if we call it art.

[^scratch]: I suspect, as does author [Charles Stross](!Wikipedia) (["Why the commercial ebook market is broken"](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/03/why_the_commercial_ebook_marke.html)), that book publishers and Amazon are taking a considerable percentage of the ebook revenue, since in this _[New Yorker](!Wikipedia)_ article, Amazon expected a newspaper publisher to agree to give Amazon 70% of the subscription fees; Amazon has monopoly control over the Kindle, and it is reasonable to think that they are similarly demanding of book publishers. From ["Priced to Sell: Is Free the Future?"](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/07/06/090706crbo_books_gladwell), 6 July 2009, by [Malcolm Gladwell](!Wikipedia):

    > "At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, James Moroney, the publisher of the [Dallas Morning News](!Wikipedia), told Congress about negotiations he'd just had with the online retailer Amazon. The idea was to license his newspaper's content to the Kindle, Amazon's new electronic reader. "They want seventy per cent of the subscription revenue," Moroney testified. "I get thirty per cent, they get seventy per cent. On top of that, they have said we get the right to republish your intellectual property to any portable device."\
    > The idea was that if a Kindle subscription to the Dallas Morning News cost ten dollars a month, seven dollars of that belonged to Amazon, the provider of the gadget on which the news was read, and just three dollars belonged to the newspaper, the provider of an expensive and ever-changing variety of editorial content. The people at Amazon valued the newspaper's contribution so little, in fact, that they felt they ought then to be able to license it to anyone else they wanted."

    _[Slate Magazine](!Wikipedia)_ [article](http://www.slate.com/id/2230821/) takes the opposite view: that Amazon is *losing* a great deal of money on each ebook:

     > "...Amazon pays the same wholesale price for Kindle books as it does for real books—generally 50 percent of the list price. For a typical hardback that retails for $26—say, E.L. Doctorow's _Homer & Langley_—Amazon pays $13 and then sells it for $9.99 on the Kindle, taking a $3 loss on each sale. (The longer-term strategy, publishers fear, is that once the Kindle gains significant market share, Amazon will negotiate lower wholesale prices for digital versions.)"
[^subsidy]: I'm using 'subsidy' in a broad sense. Intellectual property laws are subsidies; stronger IP law or more vigorous enforcement is more government subsidy of the protected _[rentiers](!Wikipedia "rentier")_; universities hiring professors of creative writing or English and enabling them to write their books on sabbaticals or summer vacations, and publishing them at or below cost - those are subsidies as well. Tax breaks are subsidies, etc.
[^rate]: A rate which, if surveys are to be believed, puts me in a quite rarefied percentile; eg ["One in Four Read No Books Last Year"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101045.html) (_[The Washington Post](!Wikipedia)_), and mentions the average for Americans was 4 books a year, and the median among those who read at least one book was 7, roughly 1 every 7 weeks.
[^wot]: And the reason I was reading _Mistborn_ at all was curiosity as to how his _The Wheel of Time_ novels might go - WoT being an excellent example of a mediocre work that sucked time that could've gone to something better.
[^just]: Just prices are easy to set for necessities - eg. if anybody is starving to death, then the price of food is not at the just price - but this doesn't work for luxuries. And most of Amazon's merchandise must be classified as a luxury. One is not going to die without the latest _[Madden NFL](!Wikipedia)_ video game or [James Patterson](!Wikipedia) novel.
[^propaganda]: A loaded word, I admit. But fiction is fundamentally lies - stories about things that never were and never will be - and 'convincing someone to do something they wouldn't've based on lies or rhetoric for some ulterior purpose' is as good a definition of 'propaganda' as I can think of.
[^language]: From the distance of centuries, everything written in the 1600s sounds equally 1600-ish. But there is more intra-group variation in the books of the '50s and '90s then there is inter-group variation. A book from the 1950s can easily date itself, but it'll be usually through allusions and ideologies, and not the actual words.
[^geo]: America, and Great Britain. France contributed a little to SF with [Jules Verne](!Wikipedia), and Japan's SF is copious (but uninfluential). Besides that, further sources of SF can be named on one hand. Poland offers us [Stanislaw Lem](!Wikipedia), Russia has... someone, no doubt. And that's about it. SF isn't prolific even in the Anglophone First World, much less the rest of the globe.
[^hanson]: [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia) has a number of good articles on how fiction can very easily mislead us, and that this may be a fundamental fact about the human brain (the 'Near/Far' psychology paradigm):
     - ["Biases of Science Fiction"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/12/biases_of_scien.html)
     - ["What Insight Literature?"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/what-insight-li.html)
     - ["Disagreement is Near-Far Bias"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/disagreement-is-nearfar-bias.html)
     - ["Beware Detached Detail"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/beware-detached-detail.html)
     - ["BSG is Detached Detail"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/bsg-is-detached-detail.html)
     - ["Against Propaganda"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/against-propaganda-.html)
[^sequels]: By a rough count of [Nebula Award for Best Novel](!Wikipedia), 14 of the 43 winners were part of some franchise or series of works. To account for Hugos, we double that to 28 for the 2 awards; if each is part of a trilogy, we need to add 84 more works to our reading list, for another 2 years.
[^sleepdealer]: To take an obscure recent example; ["_Sleep Dealer_ Injects Sci-Fi Into Immigration Debate"](http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2008/01/sleep_dealer), [_Wired_](!Wikipedia "Wired (magazine)"), 24 January 2008:

     > "_Sleep Dealer_ is remarkably topical for a film set in the future (albeit one described by Rivera as taking place "five minutes from now"). Central themes include outsourcing, corporate ownership of water, remote warfare, confessional internet diaries and military contractors who are accountable to no one. It's the rare political film without any reference to contemporary politics; like _Blade Runner_ and other big-brained sci-fi flicks, it's about ideas, not selling merchandise.
     > "I love gnomes and goblins and elves," said Rivera, who's made a name for himself touring museums and festivals with his award-winning shorts. "But what I'm really interested in is speculative fiction. I wanted to use this film to ask the question, 'Where are we going?'"
     > ...
     > That ironic juxtaposition started Rivera thinking: What if technology could extract the life force from the Mexican population and send it north?"
[^printing]: Surprisingly, the cost of printing a first edition of a book is only about [10](http://blog.laptopmag.com/ebook-price-war)[%](http://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/?p=2138) of the publisher's final wholesale price, and shipping isn't much more. The money is going into [other](http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2010/01/31/why-my-books-are-no-longer-for-sale-via-amazon/) [things](http://yuki-onna.livejournal.com/563086.html)
