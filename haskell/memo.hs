{- | OK. So each 'text' of our input has previously been split up by
 newlines. So if we wanted to memorize a quatrain or rubaiyat, say, it gets piped
 in on stdin as foo\nbar\n\quux\nbaz, turned into ["foo", "bar", "quux",
 "baz"], and then passed into 'permuteAndPutTogether'. This monster mangles
 the input through 'onHalves', puts the [[String]] pieces together
 (remembering that in the tab format, a literal newline is actual "<br>"), and
 then appends the answer, and catenates *that* (remembering that in the tabbed
 format, we separate questions and answers not with a newline, but a tab
 character). Finished, we let 'main' handle the I/O of printing to stdout. Whew!

 (In theory, this function should work on any length of text, thanks to the
 generality of 'onNths', but I haven't tested it with anything but the
 rubaiyats of Omar Khayyam.) -}
