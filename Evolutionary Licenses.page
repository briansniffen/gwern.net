You need to think of it evolutionarily.

Projects using relatively restrictive copyleft licenses (ie. GPL) are like poisondart frogs which produce poison in themselves and have bright colors advertising this. Now, this is good for them since it means the big predators will leave them alone. But it's also bad because they might poison themselves, and even if that doesn't happen, they've still expended resources to constantly produce those colors and poisons.

So you get free-riders - frogs which cut out the poison and just wear the poison colors. Everything is gravy for these frogs: the predators leave them alone and they have a small edge over the genuine article. But of course, fake poison frogs aren't an *evolutionarily stable strategy* (ESS). Predators do eat poison-colored frogs if they get hungry or stupid enough, and if they're all fake, then the poison colors cease to be a deterrent.

And then conditions are ripe for real poisontree frogs to make a comeback! But just when they are triumphant and all the predators have learned to ignore them, along comes hopping a defective frog with poison-colors, but no actual poison... of course, eventually things reach an equilibrium with enough real poisontree frogs to keep the predators honest and a reasonable number of fakers. If things get out of kilter for a while, evolution will bring it back into whack.

So a mix of reals and fakes constitute the ESS. In the same way, if every project used Affero GPL, then every frog is producing poison, which is inefficient. (One wouldn't expect a country to train every citizen as a soldier; more efficient to just train a few well). But if no frog produced poison/copyleft, then all the snakes will slither in and start gulping as they please. Either way is suboptimal. The best is a mixture - some BSD, some GPL etc. It may be confusing, but it works.
