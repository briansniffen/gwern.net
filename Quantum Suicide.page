The Cat's Tale: quantum suicide/immortality

The basic idea of quantum immortality is that certain counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics seem to lead to a rather strange result: that one will never die. This goes by the name of 'quantum immortality' (for obvious reasons) or 'quantum suicide' (for what the experimental setup 'ought' to produce).

The first version of quantum suicide uses the Copenhagen collapse interpretation.

Consider Schroedinger's cat. The cat is in a box with a murderous device that will activate if a given atom decays (with 50/50 probability) within the given time period, but it will live otherwise. Your friend is conducting this experiment on a few dozen cats, and sure enough, 17 of them die and the rest live - in statistical line with what you'd expect. Half of them should live, half die. This is from your point of view.

But consider it from the cats' point of view, their own particular case. Would they ever see an outcome where the atom *does* decay? How could they if the murder-mechanism is something like a bullet that will literally kill them before they know it? If the atom decays, there will be no 'it' to observe the result and think, oh, the atom did decay! The cats will only ever observe happy results. Expecting them to observe what happens after they die is like expecting a program to run even when the computer has been shut off.

That our existence presupposes certain facts, and that we will never observe facts opposite those, is called the 'Anthropic principle'. There are many variants, but it's widely applicable.

          'Rosencrantz: "Do you think Death could possibly be a boat?
          Guildenstern: "No, no, no -- death is not. Death isn't. Take my
                            meaning? Death is the ultimate negative. Not-being.
            You can't not be on a boat."
          Rosencrantz: "I've frequently not been on boats."
          Guildenstern: "No, no -- what you've been is not on boats."
          --Tom Stoppard, _Guildenstern & Rosencrantz are Dead_

There are a number of interesting consequences to this sort of observer-centered reasoning. For example, suppose someone offered you a bet that if you die by age 70, you owe him $1000 but if you're still alive, he'll give you that sum. Assuming you don't care about heirs, there's no way to lose! The analysis initially looks like (+1000,-1000), but when you bring in the Anthropic principle, you'll never observe that -1000 and so it is 0 - and a proposition that looks like (+1000, 0) is a very attractive one. But if the bet is modified ever so slightly, say, to bet on a friend's demise, then all of the sudden this bet might be a very bad idea (perhaps your friend has a ominous family medical history). This shows how such reasoning can be very slippery; we don't have very precise ideas about what constitutes an observer, and the principle is all about observers.

So one can imagine the proposition: one is either alive or dead, and the transition from life to death is based on a finite number of quantum collapses. After 10 collapses the wrong way, Jim's dead; had one of them gone another way, he's alive. Seems fair enough - if it takes an infinite number of collapses to kill someone, we've fallen into immortality another way, and if we deny that there is a finite or infinite number of collapses, we seem to face a slippery slope (surely we can take any given living person, and in a finite number of quantum events, turn them into a reeking corpse?).

But of those finite collapses, there is a sequence that permits the person to live. By the Anthropic principle, if there are say 10 sequences and 9 lead to death and 1 to life, what will the person observe? Just the 1 sequence; they wouldn't observe the other 9, being dead & no longer existent.

One might be tempted to object that in reality, there's never just one collapse event after another. But that doesn't matter. The issue is one of odds. If the body is made of a quadrillion atoms, the odds that each atom will collapse the 'right' way at a particular time is the same; it doesn't matter if I flip a quadrillion coins once, or one coin a quadrillion times - the chances I'll get all heads is the same.

The application here is obvious. No matter how many times we put them into the device, our cats will never observe themselves dying. We'll observe our sample dwindling until we have no cats at all, but the last cat will not know this. So this suggests the interesting proposition: subjectively, the cat should believe that the atom will never decay! Even with a probabilistic Bayesian view of truth, the cat should assign ~0% to the atom decaying, and ~100% to the atom remaining as it is. After all, no matter how many times we run the experiment, the cat will only mark up instances of the atom not decaying. How could it be rational to incorporate into one's predictions information one has not and never will acquire? It stands on about as firm a foundation as reasoning that one's guardian angel will protect one from harm.

But we can extend this. All sorts of harm boil down to a large number of quantum events. Perhaps instead of one atom deciding whether a bullet will fatally pierce one's skull and not merely glancing off, there are several billion air atoms which decide this. Nevertheless, one should expect to see the latter outcome and not the former. Perhaps instead of one atom deciding whether a cancer will metastasize, there are trillions etc. etc. So we should never observe them too? (Even though an outside observer would expect us to perish in exact measure with the calculated probabilities and would be vindicated in saying 'I told you so!' to our cooling corpse, our observations are still skewed.)


The problem with Copenhagen Suicide is that on reflection, what it predicts isn't too surprising. 'We should observe ourselves persisting through time, until there is no observer.' Well, of course. To suggest otherwise is to suggest some sort of immortal soul (if the soul is mortal, the same argument applies). But that says nothing to the effect that we *will* observe longer than we 'should'. The problem is the darn collapse could go either way and so sooner or later we're done for. And we aren't always so blissfully ignorant as the cat, either. Some ways of dying are very slow and gradual. A terminal patient may be willing to bet he will endure another week, because he can't lose; but he knows that eventually there will be a loss and soon.

    'Many Worlds quantum immortality'

"In one inconceivable complex cosmos, whenever a creature was faced     with several possible courses of action, it took them all, thereby creating many distinct temporal dimensions & distinct histories of the cosmos.
Since in every evolutionary sequence of the cosmos there were very many creatures, & each was constantly faced with many possible choices, & the combinations of all their courses were innumerable, an infinity of distinct universes exfoliated from every moment of every temporal sequence in this cosmos."
       --Olaf Stapledon

That was the very 'light' version of quantum suicide/quantum immortality. The heavy version invokes Many Worlds.

The Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) famously takes all forks of any collapse, generating all universes physically possible from the starting point of the Big Bang (although this is not every logically possible, or every universe consistent with physics).

This brings back the Anthropic argument with a vengeance. With Copenhagen, we were not guaranteed to persist past every collapse, nor were we assured that there could always be a meaningful self after every possible collapse. So the argument reduces down to common sense.

But with MWI destroys both objections. Suppose we lived our lives and an atom of our body found itself a dilemma: if it ejected a photon it would cause cancer in another cell, but if it retained the energy it would damage DNA and become cancerous itself. With Copenhagen, this is just too bad for us. But with MWI, we can say "Alright, so we're doomed along *this* branch of the universe. But let's *backtrack* a few 'collapses' and go down the fork where that excess energy never appeared in that cell! Now we're A-okay!'

And since each branch is as equally real, the first self may yet die, but the second will live on.

The first objection is answered by the basic premise of MWI: the cat lives in one universe, and dies in the other. But there's is still a living cat! And the consciousness/memories/personality of that cat will observe the universe in which it lives. And this happens no matter how many experiments we do!

At every quantum event, if there is a choice that allows us to live, then we will live. If there is no such choice, then we continue to live on from the last event that did offer such a choice.

Once we come into existence, we cannot cease to exist. By the Anthropic principle, we will observe ourselves never dying.

The consequences of this is that we can never kill ourselves. Either we will survive the attempt, or we will never make it.

Can we elaborate further? Certainly. One of the issues with infinite universes, in either space or time, is that they should give rise to every possible configuration of that universe since each configuration has a non-zero chance of arising, and typically infinite is understood in a conventional sense, so that a non-zero odd multiplied by infinity gives an infinite number of occurrences. Inasmuch as you and I are included in many possible configurations, we ought to exist an infinite number of times, and in every possible variation. This wreaks utter havoc with the idea of the universe as predictable or even remotely like what we think it so. This is a very general issue - it applies to Boltzmann brains, it comes up with Tegmark's multi-multiverses, it argues against Schmidhuber's idea that the multiverse is merely the running of every enumerable Turing machine (his defense being his dubious Speed prior), and so on. Induction & predictability are not preserved.

So doesn't this apply to a MWI multiverse? If we have a large batch of energetic gas, why couldn't there exist a sequence of quantum events that makes it isomorphic to my brain? And there is much more energetic gas in the universe than there is my brains, so the universes leading forth from my brain to new states of my brain might even be outnumbered by the universes leading forth from energetic regions to states of my brain. As with Boltzmann brains, this would destroy induction.

While cool, we don't want to admit quantum immorality as a real fact of our world. It isn't barred by the physics, but there may be ways to get around the uncomfortable implications and render them of minimal interest.

One approach is to regard ourselves as a random sample from all observers in our particular 'class'. This class is constantly growing and shrinking as the universe evolves, and each observer in it is going down various forks. Most forks are nonfatal and outright boring or conventional. So intuitively we expect 'normal' observers - like what we think we are right now - to be in the overwhelming majority. Thus we would expect to observe what they observe: growing old, sickening, and even the last few moments before consciousness ceases. A few observer-moments (as Bostrom calls them) will continue on, but they are a small number; perhaps even smaller than the number of normal observers who dream or hallucinate about being quantum-immortals!

We can as a practical matter disregard bizarre thermal possibilities such as all the air in the room rushing to the corner; so why not disregard unlikely quantum possibilities? If quantum immortality is true, after all, it has to be consistent with our past observations.

Quantum immortality has long been an interest of mine, so there are more references than I could possibly track down. Nick Bostrom's _Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy_ strongly influences my thinking on the topic; in covering quantum suicide, I draw more on Tegmark's ideas than Moravec's. I borrow the point that quantum mechanics/quantum suicide must 'add up to normality' from Eliezer Yudkowsky's 'Living in Many Worlds' essay. The section on induction and linking Schmidhuber, Tegmark, and Boltzmann is entirely my own synthesis.
