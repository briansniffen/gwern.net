A perennial lure of technology is its promise to let us do things that we couldn't do before, and in ways we wouldn't before.

An example here would be Wikipedia and wikis in general: by lowering the 'cost' of changing a page, and using software that makes undoing most vandalism far easier than doing it, the participation goes through the roof. I've often thought that if the 'barriers to entry' were charted against 'contributed effort', one would see an [exponentially inverse](!Wikipedia "Exponential decay") relation. An entire essay could likely be written on how the Wikipedia community put up small barriers - each individually reasonable, and not too onerous even in the aggregate - of referencing, of banning anonymous page creation, etc. led to the first sustained drop in contributors and contribution. The effect is nonlinear.

# New regimes

The best rule of thumb here is perhaps the one cited by [Stewart Brand](!Wikipedia) in _[The Clock of the Long Now](!Wikipedia)_:

> "According to a rule of thumb among engineers, any tenfold quantitative change _is_ a qualitative change, a fundamentally new situation rather than a simple extrapolation."

Clear as mud, eh? Let's try more quotes, then:

> "The human longing for freedom of information is a terrible and wonderful thing. It delineates a pivotal difference between mental emancipation and slavery. It has launched protests, rebellions, and revolutions. Thousands have devoted their lives to it, thousands of others have even died for it. And it can be stopped dead in its tracks by requiring people to search for "how to set up proxy" before viewing their anti-government website.
>
> I was reminded of this recently by Eliezer's [Less Wrong Progress Report](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/04/less-wrong-progress-report.html). He mentioned how surprised he was that so many people were posting so much stuff on [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/), when very few people had ever taken advantage of [Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/)' policy of accepting contributions if you emailed them to a moderator and the moderator approved. Apparently all us folk brimming with ideas for posts didn't want to deal with the aggravation."^[Yvain, ["Beware Trivial Inconveniences"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/). The connection to Wikipedia [is obvious](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/bj6).]

> "We examine open access articles from three journals at the University of Georgia School of Law and confirm that legal scholarship freely available via open access improves an article's research impact. Open access legal scholarship – which today appears to account for almost half of the output of law faculties – can expect to receive 50% more citations than non-open access writings of similar age from the same venue."[^law]

[^law]: Abstract of["Citation Advantage of Open Access Legal Scholarship"](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1777090), Donovan & Watson 2011. Are legal scholars *lazy*? Are law libraries *ill-funded*? Do legal scholars have little incentive to write well-researched papers? And yet, making papers a little easier to access results in a dramatic difference in citation.

    [Swan 2010](http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/18516/) surveyed a 31 studies and found 27 showing benefits to OA. For example, benefits to [open access](!Wikipedia) were found in [biology](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040157) by [Gunther Eysenbach](!Wikipedia), and [Steve Lawrence](!Wikipedia "Steve Lawrence (computer scientist)") found similar results for [computer science](http://ivyspring.com/steveLawrence/SteveLawrence.htm) articles online or offline:

    > "The mean number of citations to offline articles is 2.74, and the mean number of citations to online articles is 7.03, or 2.6 times greater than the number for offline articles. These numbers mask variations over time -- in particular, older articles have more citations on average, and older articles are less likely to be online. When considering articles within each year, and averaging across all years from 1990 to 2000, we find that online articles are cited 4.5 times more often than offline articles.
    >
    > We also analyzed differences within each publication venue, where multiple years for the same conference are considered as separate venues. We computed the percentage increase in the average number of citations to online articles compared to offline articles. When offline articles were more highly cited, we used the negative of the percentage increase for offline articles. For example, if the average number of citations for offline articles is 2, and the average for online articles is 4, the percentage increase would be 100%. For the opposite situation, the percentage increase would be -100%. Figure 2 shows the results. Averaging the percentage increase across 1,494 venues containing at least five offline and five online articles results in an average of 336% more citations to online articles compared to offline articles published in the same venue [the first, second (median), and third quartiles of the distribution are 58%, 158%, and 361%]."

    On the other hand, one [economics](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1746243) study showed no benefit, [Craig et al 2007](http://www.publishingresearch.net/Citations-SummaryPaper3_000.pdf.pdf) [says](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B83WV-4P18BNV-1/2/78819b964b25ea8dcd2b7013f3ba74e4) found no benefit in one physics subfield:

    > "Three non-exclusive postulates have been proposed to account for the observed citation differences between OA and non-OA articles: an open access postulate, a selection bias postulate, and an early view postulate. The most rigorous study to date (in condensed matter physics) showed that, after controlling for the early view postulate, the remaining difference in citation counts between OA and non-OA articles is explained by the selection bias postulate. No evidence was found to support the OA postulate per se; i.e. article OA status alone has little or no effect on citations. Further studies using a similarly rigorous approach are required to determine the generality of this finding."

> "There are tools to just say, “Give me your social security number, give me your address and your mother's maiden name, and we send you a physical piece of paper and you sign it and send it back to us.” By the time that's all accomplished, you are a very safe user. But by then you are also not a user, because for every step you have to take, the dropoff rate is probably 30 percent. If you take ten steps, and each time you lose one-third of the users, you'll have no users by the time you're done with the fourth step."^[[Max Levchin](!Wikipedia), PayPal co-founder; pg 11, [_Founders at Work_](http://www.foundersatwork.com/)]

> "For example, usability theory holds that if you make a task 10% easier, you double the number of people that can accomplish it. I've always felt that if you can make it 10% easier to fill in a [bug report](!Wikipedia), you'll get twice as many bug reports. (When I removed two questions from the [Joel On Software](!Wikipedia) signup page, the rate of new signups went up dramatically)."^[_Joel on Software_, ["FogBugz"](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/fog0000000162.html)]

> "Think of these barriers as an obstacle course that people have to run before you can count them as your customers. If you start out with a field of 1000 runners, about half of them will trip on the tires; half of the survivors won't be strong enough to jump the wall; half of *those* survivors will fall off the rope ladder into the mud, and so on, until only 1 or 2 people actually overcome all the hurdles. With 8 or 9 barriers, *everybody* will have one non-negotiable deal killer....By incessant pounding on eliminating barriers, [Microsoft] slowly pried some market share away from Lotus."^[_Joel on Software_, ["Strategy Letter III: Let Me Go Back!"](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html)]

# Toeing the precipice

It may take only a few restrictions before one has inched far enough the 'barriers' axis that the 'contributions' does in fact fall by tenfold. One sees Wikipedia slowly adding restrictions:

- 2005: we [ban anonymous page creation](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2005-12-05/Page creation restrictions");
- 2006: anonymous users must [solve CAPTCHAs](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit) if they wish to add URLs;
- 2007: use `{{fact}}` templates institutionalized, and tougher referencing guidelines;
- 2008: harsher [AfDs](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion") mean a banner year for [deletionists](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism) such as [User:TTN](!Wikipedia);
- 2009: [flagged revisions](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Flagged revisions") on some wikis, in some areas of English Wikipedia. The end of live changes, [prior restraint](!Wikipedia) on publication.
- 2011 (?): [new editors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29/Archive_31#We_need_more_New_Page_Patrollers) [banned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29/Proposal_to_require_autoconfirmed_status_in_order_to_create_articles) from article creation (for their own good, of course)

Each of these steps seems harmless enough, perhaps.

Few objected to the banning of anonymous page creation by [Jimbo Wales](!Wikipedia) during the [Seigenthaler incident](!Wikipedia), and most of those were unprincipled ones. The objector was all for a tougher War on Drugs - er, I mean Terror, or was that Vandalism? (maybe Poverty) - but they didn't want to be stampeded into it by some bad PR. Too, few objected to [CAPTCHA](!Wikipedia)s: 'take that you scumbag spammers!'

## Falling

But by 2007 the water had become hot enough to be felt by devotees of modern fiction (that is, anime & manga franchises, video games, novels, etc.), and even the great Jimbo [could not expect](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mzoli's Meats") to see his articles go un-AfD'd.

But who really cares about what some nerds like? What matters is [Notability](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Notability") with a capital N, and the fact that our feelings were hurt by some [Wikigroaning](http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/wikigroaning.php)! After all, clearly the proper way to respond to the observation that [Lightsaber combat](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Lightsaber_combat&oldid=220748376) was longer than [Sabre](!Wikipedia "Sabre") is to delete its contents and have people read the short, scrawny - but _serious_! - [Lightsaber](!Wikipedia "Lightsaber") article instead.

If it doesn't appear in Encarta or Encyclopedia Britannica, or isn't treated at the same (proportional) length, then it must go!

## By the numbers

Deleting based on notability, fiction articles in particular, doesn't merely ill-serve our readers (who are numerous; note how many of Wikipedia's [most popular pages](http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikipedia/en/) are fiction-related), but it also damages the community.

We can see it indirectly in the global statistics. The analyses ([2007](!Wikipedia "User:Dragons flight/Log analysis"), [2008](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2009-01-03/Editing stats")) show it. We are seeing fewer new editors, few new articles, fewer new images; less of everything, basically, except tedium.

Worse, it's not that the growth of Wikipedia has stopped accelerating in important metrics. The rate of increase has in some cases not merely stopped increasing, but started dropping!

> "...the size of the active editing community of the English Wikipedia peaked in early 2007 and has declined somewhat since then. Like Wikipedia's article count, the number of active editors grew exponentially during the early years of the project. The article creation rate (which is tracked at [Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia](!Wikipedia)) peaked around August 2006 at about 2400 net new articles per day and has fallen since then, to around under 1400 in recent months. [The graph is mirrored at Andrew Lih's ["Wikipedia Plateau?"](http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/06/28/wikipedia-plateau/).]
>
> ...[User:MBisanz](!Wikipedia) has charted the number of new accounts registered per month, which tells a very similar story: March 2007 recorded the largest number of new accounts, and the rate of new account creation has fallen significantly since then. Declines in activity have also been noted, and fretted about, at [Wikipedia:Requests for adminship](!Wikipedia)...."

This been noted in multiple sources, such as Felipe Ortega's thesis, ["_Wikipedia: A Quantitative Analysis_"](http://libresoft.es/Members/jfelipe/phd-thesis):

> "So far, our empirical analysis of the top ten Wikipedias has revealed that the stabilization of the number of contributions from logged authors in Wikipedia during 2007 has influenced the evolution of the project, breaking down the steady growing rate of previous years...
>
> Unfortunately, this results raise several important concerns for the Wikipedia project. Though we do not have empirical data from 2008, the change in the trend of births and deaths [new & inactive editors] will clearly decrease the number of available logged authors in all language versions, thus cutting out the capacity of the project to effectively undertake revisions and improve contents. Even more serious is the slightly decreasing trend that is starting to appear in the monthly number of births of most versions. The rate of deaths, on the contrary, does not seem to leave its ascending tendency. Evaluating the results for 2008 will be a key aspect to validate the hypothesis that this trend has changed indeed, and that the Wikipedia project needs to put in practice more aggressive measures to attract new users, if they do not want to see the monthly effort decrease in due course, as a result of the lack of human authors."^[pg 136, "4.4 Demographic Analysis of the Wikipedia Community"]

Ortega notes indications that this is a pathology unique to En:

> "In the first place, we note the remarkable difference between the English and the German language versions. The first one presents one of the worst survival curves in this series, along with the Portuguese Wikipedia, whereas the German version shows the best results until approximately 800 days. From that point on, the Japanese language version is the best one. In fact, the German, French, Japanese and Polish Wikipedias exhibits some of the best survival curves in the set, and only the English version clearly deviates from this general trend. The most probable explanation for this difference, taking into account that we are considering only logged authors in this analysis, is that the English Wikipedia receives too contributions from too many casual users, who never come back again after performing just a few revisions."^[_ibid_. pg 137]

Erik Moeller of the WMF tried to [wave away the results](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/11/26/wikipedias-volunteer-story/) by pointing out that "The number of people writing Wikipedia peaked about two and a half years ago, declined slightly for a brief period, and has remained stable since then", but he also shoots himself in the foot by pointing out that the number of articles keeps growing. That is not a sustainable disparity. Worse, as the original writers leave, their articles become [legacy code](!Wikipedia) - on which later editors must engage in [archaeology](!Wikipedia "Software archaeology"), trying to retrieve the original references or understand why something was omitted, or must simply remove content because they do not understand the larger context or are ignorant. (I have had considerable difficulty answering some straightforward questions about errors in articles I researched and wrote entirely on my own; how well could a later editor have handled the questions?)

The numbers have been depressing ever since, from the 2010 [informal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mr.Z-man/newusers) & [Foundation](http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Editor_Trends_Study/Results#Cohort_Analysis) [study](http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/March_2011_Update#What_We.27ve_Learned) on editor demographics to [2011 article contributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EnwikipediagrowthGom.PNG). (It is almost unintentionally hilarious to look at the proposed solutions; one amounts to [restoring early Wikipedia culture & practices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Guides/New_pages) in private sandboxes, protected from the regulars & their guidelines.)

Remember, most measures are directed against *casual* users. Power users can navigate the endless processes, or call in powerful friends, or simply wait a few years^[The recreation of [Mzoli's](!Wikipedia) article and the endless deletion debates about Daniel Brandt - crowned in success for the deletionists - again come to mind.]

And it's casual users who matter. We lost the credentialed experts years ago, if we ever had them. [Surveys](http://survey.nitens.org/?sid=21693 asking why are almost otiose; they will do so if they are exceptional or if they are [managing PR](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/mar/29/wikipedia-survey-academic-contributions) around a discovery. But Wikipedia is not [Long Content](About#long-content); why *would* they contribute if they can get the traffic they desire just by [inserting](http://zikoblog.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/500-times-more/) [links](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/08/footnotes-history-wikipedia)^[Which as links to credentialed sources will be uncontroversial and require little defense, vastly improving the ROI of editing Wikipedia.]? Why would they build their intellectual houses on sand?[^knuth] They get the best of both worlds - gaining traffic and avoiding the toxic deletionists.

[^knuth]: [To quote](https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006) the great computer scientist [Donald Knuth](!Wikipedia):

    > "I think that Wikipedia's enormously successful, but it's so brittle, you know, if I was, if I spent a lot of time writing an article for the Wikipedia, and I wanted to make sure nobody screwed it up, I would have to check that article every day to make sure that it was still okay, and you know, after I've done that I want to move on and go on to other, other things in my life. With TeX, I wanted stability especially urgently because people are depending on it to be a fixed point that they can build on, so in that respect, I differ from the GNU public license."

And we can see this quite directly: when the general population of editors get solicited to contribute to AfD, their !votes are different from the AfD regulars, and in particular, when keep !voters spread the word about an AfD, their recruits are much more likely to !vote keep a well, while would-be deleters do their cause no favor with publicity[^botsolicitation]. Can there be any more convincing proof that deletionism and its manifestations are a cancer on the Wikipedia corpus?

[^botsolicitation]:  ["The Effects of Group Composition on Decision Quality in a Social Production Community"](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lam/papers/lam_group2010_wikipedia-group-decisions.pdf), Lam et al 2010, pg 7:

    > "We also found that there have been two bots (computer programs that edit Wikipedia)—BJBot and Jayden54Bot—that automatically automatically notified article editors about AfD discussions and recruited them to participate per the established policy. These bots performed AfD notifications for several months, and offer us an opportunity to study the effect of recruitment that is purely policy driven. We use a process like one described above to detect successful instances of bot-initiated recruitment: if a recruitment bot edited a user's talk page, and that user !voted in an AfD within two days, then we consider that user to have been recruited by the bot.
    >
    > Using the above processes, we identified 8,464 instances of successful recruiting. Table 2 shows a summary of who did the recruiting, and how their recruits !voted. We see large differences in !voting behavior, which suggests that there is bias in who people choose to recruit. (From these data we cannot tell whether the bias is an intentional effort to influence consensus, or the result of social network homophily [14].) Participants recruited by keep !voters were about four times less likely to support deletion as those recruited by delete !voters. The participants that bots recruited also appear unlikely to support deletion, which reflects the policy bias we observed earlier.
    >
    > To see what effect participant recruitment has on decision quality, we introduce four binary variables: `BotRecruit`, `NomRecruit`, `DeleteRecruit`, and `KeepRecruit`. These variables indicate whether a bot, the AfD nominator, a delete !voter, or a keep !voter successfully recruited somebody to the group, respectively.
    >
    > Looking back to table 1, we find that regardless of the decision, none of the first three variables has a statistically significant effect. On the other hand, when a keep !voter recruited someone to the discussion, we see a significant effect: delete decisions are more likely to be reversed. We offer two possible explanations: the first is that recruitment by keep !voters, biased as it may appear, is a sign of positive community interest, and suggests that the article should be kept. If the community decides otherwise and deletes the article, then decision quality suffers. An alternative explanation is that keep !voter recruitment is a sign of activism among those who prefer to keep the article. These proponents may be especially persistent in maintaining the article's existence in Wikipedia, even if it requires working to reverse a delete decision."

## No club that would have me

This result will come as no surprise to longtime [inclusionists](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism). The deletion process deletes [most articles](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:AFD_100_days") which enter it, and has long been complained about by outsiders. Entire communities (such as the [web comics](!Wikipedia "Webcomic")^[See [Slashdot](!Wikipedia)'s ["Call For Halt To Wikipedia Webcomic Deletions"](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/31/0328239) for an overview.] or [MUD](!Wikipedia "MUD") online communities^[["MUD history dissolving into the waters of time"](http://www.massively.com/2009/01/06/mud-history-dissolving-into-the-waters-of-time/)]) have been alienated by purges of articles - purges which not infrequently result in abuse of process, much [newbie biting](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers"), and comical spectacles like AfD regulars (usually deletionists) insisting a given article is absolutely non-notable and leading world experts in the relevant field demurring; a particularly good AfD may see statements of experts dismissed on speciously procedural grounds such as having been made in the expert's blog (and so failing [WP:RS](!Wikipedia), or perhaps simply being dismissed as [WP:OR](!Wikipedia)). The trend has been clear. [Andrew Lih](!Wikipedia), who has been editing Wikipedia even longer than myself (since 2003) and who wrote [a book](!Wikipedia "The Wikipedia Revolution: How a bunch of nobodies created the world's greatest encyclopedia ") on Wikipedia, writes in ["Unwanted: New articles in Wikipedia"](http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/07/10/unwanted-new-articles-in-wikipedia/):

> 'It's incredible to me that the community in Wikipedia has come to this, that articles so obviously “keep” just a year ago, are being challenged and locked out. When I was active back on the mailing lists in 2004, I was a well known deletionist. “Wiki isn't paper, but it isn't an attic,” I would say. Selectivity matters for a quality encyclopedia. But it's a whole different mood in 2007. Today, I'd be labeled a wild eyed inclusionist. I suspect most veteran Wikipedians would be labeled a bleeding heart inclusionist too. How did we raise a new generation of folks who want to wipe out so much, who would shoot first, and not ask questions whatsoever? [If Lih can write this in 2007, you can imagine how people who identified as inclusionists in 2004, such as myself or [The Cunctator](!Wikipedia "User:The Cunctator"), look to Wikipedians who recently joined.]
>
> It's as if there is a [Soup Nazi](!Wikipedia) culture now in Wikipedia. There are throngs of deletion happy users, like grumpy old gatekeepers, tossing out customers and articles if they don't comply to some new prickly hard-nosed standard. It used to be if an article was short, someone would add to it. If there was spam, someone would remove it. If facts were questionable, someone would research it. The beauty of Wikipedia was the human factor — reasonable people interacting and collaborating, building off each other's work. It was important to start stuff, even if it wasn't complete. Assume good faith, neutral point of view and if it's not right, `{{sofixit}}`. Things would grow.'

I was particularly depressed to read [in the comments](http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/07/10/unwanted-new-articles-in-wikipedia/#comment-53638) things from administrators whose names I recognize due to their long tenure on Wikipedia, like [Llywrch](!Wikipedia "User:Illywrch") (joined 2002):

> "I’m sorry that you encountered that, Andrew — but not surprised. I had [my own encounter](http://original-research.blogspot.com/2007/07/i-found-myself-experiencing-ugly-side.html) with the new generation of “quote policy, not reasoning” deletionists; I feel as if I encountered (to quote from the song) “the forces of evil from a bozo nightmare.” No one — including me — looked good after that exchange. (I keep thinking that I should have said something different, but the surreality of the situation multiplied with the square of my frustration kept me from my best.)"

Or [Stbalbach](http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/07/10/unwanted-new-articles-in-wikipedia/#comment-53809):

> "I’m a long time editor, since 2003, ranked in the top 300 by number of edits (most in article space). On May 11th 2007 I mostly gave up on Wikipedia – there is something wrong with the community, in particular people deleting content. I’d never seen anything like it prior to late 2006 and 2007. Further, the use of “nag tags” at the top of articles is out of hand. It’s easier to nag and delete than it is to research and fix. Too many know-nothings who want to “help” have found a powerful niche by nagging and deleting without engaging in dialog and simply citing 3 letter rules. If a user is unwilling or incapable of working to improve an article they should not be placing nag tags or deleting content."

Also interesting is [Ta bu shi da yu](http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/07/10/unwanted-new-articles-in-wikipedia/#comment-56035)'s comment, inasmuch as Ta bu invented the infamous `{{fact}}`:

> "I have also seen this happening. It’s incredible that those who are so incredibly stupid can get away with misusing the speedy deletion tag! As for DRV… don’t make me laugh. It seems to be slanted to keep articles deleted. I can’t agree more with your sentiments that if you know all the codes to WP:AFD, then you are a menace to Wikipedia."

Why is this culture changing? In part because article writing seems to get no more respect. A [review article](http://adsri.anu.edu.au/people/visitors/ONeil/ONEIL_Wikipedia_Authority.pdf) summarizes the findings of Burke and Kraut 2008^[[‘Taking Up the Mop: Identifying Future Wikipedia Administrators’](http://www.thoughtcrumbs.com/publications/chi1364-burke.pdf), Moira Burke and Robert Kraut, in _Proceedings of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems_, Florence, Italy, 5-10. April 2008, pp. 3441-6]:

> "...it is proving increasingly hard to become a Wikipedia administrator: 2,700 candidates were nominated between 2001 and 2008, with a success rate of 53 percent. The rate has dropped from 75.5 percent until 2005 to 42 percent in 2006 and 2007. Article contribution was not a strong predictor of success. The most successful candidates were those who edited the Wikipedia policy or project space; such an edit is worth ten article edits."

What sort of editor, with a universe of fascinating topics to write upon, would choose to spend most of his time on the policy namespace? What sort of editor would choose to stop writing articles?[^statements] Administrators with minimal experience in creating content - and much experience in destroying it and rewriting the rules to permit the destruction of even more. Is this not almost the opposite of what one wants? And imagine how the authors must feel! An article is not a trivial undertaking; sometime sit down, select a random subject, and try to write a well-organized, fluent, comprehensive, and accurate encyclopedia article on it. It's not as easy as it looks, and it's even harder to write a well-referenced and correctly formatted one. To have an article deleted is bad enough; I can't imagine any neophyte editors wanting to have anything to do with Wikipedia if an article of theirs got railroaded through AfD.

[^statements]: From "Cultural Transformations in Wikipedia or ‘From Emancipation to Product Ideology’: An Interview with Christian Stegbauer", collected in [_A Wikipedia Reader_](http://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%237reader_Wikipedia.pdf):

    > "Our 2006 research [Christian Stegbauer, ‘Wikipedia. Das Rätsel der Kooperation’ (‘Wikipedia: the mystery behind the cooperation’), Wiesbaden: VS, 2009, p. 279 et seq.] compared content on user pages from their original starting date to the present. 13 We noticed a transformation from emancipation to product ideology among those who had reached leadership status, but not for ones less integrated. Typical statements from a user site’s first days would be: ‘Wikipedia is a great idea’; ‘[a] never-ending encyclopedia created by many different authors’; ‘everyone should be able to exchange their knowledge for free’; ‘Wikipedia is like fulfilling a dream – a book in which everyone can write what they want’; ‘the Internet shouldn’t be regarded as a goldmine’; ‘Making information available free of charge is an important task’; ‘the project’s concept is fantastic’; ‘the idea behind Wikipedia is well worth supporting’.
   >
   > Six out of seven users who changed their ideological statements were core users, and five of these were administrators. Half of them deleted their opinion on emancipation ideology in the same instance they became administrators. In five out of nine cases, they expressed the product ideology, including remarks about ‘unreasonable’ people damaging the project, about endless discussions that should not take place when energy should be invested in the articles instead, and about ‘difficult’ people who are not welcome at Wikipedia. We also found phrasing such as ‘certain level of expertise is necessary for writing the articles’ or that liberal processing is the reason behind low quality contributions."

Deleting articles and piling on policy after guideline after policy are both *directly* opposed to why Wikipedians contribute! When [surveyed in 2011](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2011-06-13/News and notes#First results of editor survey: Wikipedians 90% male, 71% altruist"):

> 'The two most frequently selected reasons for continuing to edit Wikipedia were "I like the idea of volunteering to share knowledge" (71%) and "I believe that information should be freely available to everyone" (69%), followed by "I like to contribute to subject matters in which I have expertise" (63%) and "It's fun" (60%).'

And ironically, the more effort an editor pours into a topic and the longer & more detailed the article becomes, the more blind hatred it inspires in deletionists. If you look at AfDs for small articles or stubs, the deletionists seem positively lucid & rational; but make the article 50kB long, and watch the rhetoric fly. I call this the *[fancruft](!Wikipedia) effect*: deletionists are mentally allergic to information they do not care about or like.

If a deletionist sees an article on "Lightsaber combat"[^combat] and it's just a page long, then he has little problem with it. It may strike him as too big, but reasonable. But if the article dares to be comprehensive, if it is clearly the product of many hours' labor on the part of multiple editors, if there are touches like references and quotes - then [something is wrong on the Internet](http://xkcd.com/386/), the very universe is out of joint that this article has been so well-developed when so many more deserving topics languish, it is a cosmic injustice. A dirty beggar is parading around acting like an emperor. The article *does not know its place*. It needs to be smacked down and hard. And who better than the deletionist?

What is the ultimate status-lowering action which one can do to an editor, short of actually banning or blocking them? Deleting their articles.

In a particular subject area, who is most likely to work on obscurer articles? The experts and high-value editors - they have the resources, they have the interest, they have the competency. Anyone
who grew up in America post-1980 can work on `[[Darth Vader]]`; many fewer can work on `[[Grand Admiral Thrawn]]`. Anyone can work on `[[Basho]]`; few can work on `[[Fujiwara no Teika]]`.

What has Wikipedia been most likely to delete in its shift deletionist over the years? Those obscurer articles.

The proof is in the pudding: all the high-value/status Star Wars editors have decamped for somewhere they are valued; all the high-value/status Star Trek editors, the Lost editors... the list goes on. They left for a community that respected them and their work more; these specific examples are striking because the editors had to *make* a community, but one should not suppose such departures are limited to fiction-related articles. There may be [evaporative cooling of the community](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/) but it's *not* towards the obsessive fans.

Outsiders! I realize it might sound like a stretch that anyone enjoys the power of nominating articles, that being a deletionist could be a joyful role. You say you understand how administrators (with their ability to directly delete, to ban, to rollback etc.) could grow drunk on power, but how could AfD nominations lead to such a feeling?

But I know from personal experience that there is power exercised in nominating for deletion. Well do I know the dark arts of gaming the system: of the clever use of templates, of the process of deleting the article by carefully challenging and removing piece after piece, of invoking the appropriate guidelines and policies to demolish arguments and references.

I have seen the wails and groans in the edit summaries & comments of my opponents, and exulted in their defeat. It's very real, the temptation of exercising this power. It's easy to convince yourself that you are doing the right thing, and merely enforcing the policies/guidelines as the larger community set them down. (Were all my nominations just? No, but I have succeeded in fooling myself so well that I can no longer tell which ones truly did deserve deletion and which ones were deleted just because I disliked them or their authors.)

Who can say how many authors take it personally? The deletion process is inherently insulting: "Out of 2.5 million articles, yours stands out as sucking so badly that it is irredeemable and must be obliterated."

# What Is To Be Done?

Wikipedia was enabled by software. It enabled a community to form. This community did truly great work; it's often said Wikipedia is historic, but I think most people have lost sight of how historic Wikipedia is as it fades into the background of modern life; perhaps only scholars of the future have enough perspective on this leviathan, in the same way that Diderot's encyclopedia was - for all the controversy and banning - not given its full due at publication. (But how could it? Encyclopedias are more processes than finished works, and of no encyclopedia is this more true than Wikipedia.)

That community did great work, astonishing in breadth and depth, I said. But that community is also responsible for misusing the tools. If vandalism is easier to remove than create, then it will tend to disappear. But AfD is not vandalism. There are no technical fixes for deletionist editors. As long as most editors have weak views, are willing to stand by while 'nerdy' topics feel the ax, who think 'deletionists mostly get it correct', then the situation will not change.

Could deletion be a positive feedback cycle? Will the waves of deletion continue to encourage editors to leave, to not sign up, to let the deletionists continue their grisly work unopposed, until Wikipedia is a shell of what it was?

Like the cooling dwarf star left by a supernova - its lost brilliance traveling onwards to eternity.

[^combat]: I bring up the 'Lightsaber combat' article because I did substantial work referencing it before its wiki-deletion, but because it was redirected the original page history still survives. It is worthwhile comparing the [original page](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lightsaber_combat&oldid=218546245) with its [replacement section](!Wikipedia "Lightsaber combat#Choreography") in the 'Lightsaber' article.

    I am chuffed to note that the merge has resulted in *inferior* references! eg. the [Nick Gillard](!Wikipedia) quote in paragraph 2 is unsourced and has a `{{fact}}` template, but *was* referenced in the original. Further, that quote is trivially re-referenced (#3 hit in Google). My standards may be too high, but I can't help but think that it takes real incompetence to not only lose a reference, but be unable to re-find such an easily found quote.
