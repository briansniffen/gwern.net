A perennial lure of technology is its promise to let us do things that we couldn't do before, and in ways we wouldn't before.

An example here would be Wikipedia and wikis in general: by lowering the 'cost' of changing a page, and using software that makes undoing most vandalism far easier than doing it, the participation goes through the roof. I've often thought that if the 'barriers to entry' were charted against 'contributed effort', one would see an [exponentially inverse](!Wikipedia "Exponential decay") relation. An entire essay could likely be written on how the Wikipedia community put up small barriers - each individually reasonable, and not too onerous even in the aggregate - of referencing, of banning anonymous page creation, etc. led to the first sustained drop in contributors and contribution. The effect is nonlinear.

# New regimes

The best rule of thumb here is perhaps [Stewart Brand](!Wikipedia)'s, from _[The Clock of the Long Now](!Wikipedia)_:

> "According to a rule of thumb among engineers, any tenfold quantitative change _is_ a qualitative change, a fundamentally new situation rather than a simple extrapolation."

Clear as mud, eh? Let's try more quotes, then:

> "The human longing for freedom of information is a terrible and wonderful thing. It delineates a pivotal difference between mental emancipation and slavery. It has launched protests, rebellions, and revolutions. Thousands have devoted their lives to it, thousands of others have even died for it. And it can be stopped dead in its tracks by requiring people to search for "how to set up proxy" before viewing their anti-government website.
>
> I was reminded of this recently by Eliezer's [Less Wrong Progress Report](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/04/less-wrong-progress-report.html). He mentioned how surprised he was that so many people were posting so much stuff on [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/), when very few people had ever taken advantage of [Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/)' policy of accepting contributions if you emailed them to a moderator and the moderator approved. Apparently all us folk brimming with ideas for posts didn't want to deal with the aggravation."^[Yvain, ["Beware Trivial Inconveniences"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/). The connection to Wikipedia [is obvious](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/bj6).]

> "We examine open access articles from three journals at the University of Georgia School of Law and confirm that legal scholarship freely available via open access improves an article’s research impact. Open access legal scholarship – which today appears to account for almost half of the output of law faculties – can expect to receive 50% more citations than non-open access writings of similar age from the same venue."^[["Citation Advantage of Open Access Legal Scholarship"](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1777090), Donovan & Watson 2011. Are legal scholars *lazy*? Are law libraries *ill-funded*? Do legal scholars have little incentive to write well-researched papers? And yet, making papers a little easier to access results in a dramatic difference in citation.]

But by then you are also not a user, because for every step you have to take, the dropoff rate is probably 30 percent. If you take ten steps, and each time you lose one-third of the users, you’ll have no users by the time you’re done with the fourth step."^[[Max Levchin](!Wikipedia), PayPal co-founder; pg 11, [_Founders at Work_](http://www.foundersatwork.com/)]

# Toeing the precipice

It may take only a few restrictions before one has inched far enough the 'barriers' axis that the 'contributions' does in fact fall by tenfold. One sees Wikipedia slowly adding restrictions:

- 2005: we [ban anonymous page creation](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2005-12-05/Page creation restrictions");
- 2006: anonymous users must [solve CAPTCHAs](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit) if they wish to add URLs;
- 2007: use `{{fact}}` templates institutionalized, and tougher referencing guidelines;
- 2008: harsher [AfDs](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion") mean a banner year for [deletionists](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism) such as [User:TTN](!Wikipedia);
- 2009 (?): [flagged revisions](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Flagged revisions"). The end of live changes, [prior restraint](!Wikipedia) on publication.

Each of these steps seems harmless enough, perhaps.

Few objected to the banning of anonymous page creation by [Jimbo Wales](!Wikipedia) during the [Seigenthaler incident](!Wikipedia), and most of those were unprincipled ones. The objector was all for a tougher War on Drugs - er, I mean Terror, or was that Vandalism? (maybe Poverty) - but they didn't want to be stampeded into it by some bad PR. Too, few objected to [CAPTCHA](!Wikipedia)s: 'take that you scumbag spammers!'

## Falling

But by 2007 the water had become hot enough to be felt by devotees of modern fiction (that is, anime & manga franchises, video games, novels, etc.), and even the great Jimbo [could not expect](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mzoli's Meats") to see his articles go un-AfD'd.

But who really cares about what some nerds like? What matters is [Notability](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Notability") with a capital N, and the fact that our feelings were hurt by some [Wikigroaning](http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/wikigroaning.php)! After all, clearly the proper way to respond to the observation that [Lightsaber combat](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Lightsaber_combat&oldid=220748376) was longer than [Sabre](!Wikipedia "Sabre") is to delete its contents and have people read the short, scrawny - but _serious_! - [Lightsaber](!Wikipedia "Lightsaber") article instead.

If it doesn't appear in Encarta or Encyclopedia Britannica, or isn't treated at the same (proportional) length, then it must go!

## By the numbers

Deleting based on notability, fiction articles in particular, doesn't merely ill-serve our readers (who are numerous; note how many of Wikipedia's [most popular pages](http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikipedia/en/) are fiction-related), but it also damages the community.

The analyses ([2007](!Wikipedia "User:Dragons_flight/Log_analysis"), [2008](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2009-01-03/Editing_stats")) show it. We are seeing fewer new editors, few new articles, fewer new images; less of everything, basically, except tedium.

Worse, it's not that the growth of Wikipedia has stopped accelerating in important metrics. The rate of increase has in some cases not merely stopped increasing, but started dropping!

This been noted in multiple sources, such as Felipe Ortega's thesis, ["_Wikipedia: A Quantitative Analysis_"](http://libresoft.es/Members/jfelipe/phd-thesis):

> "So far, our empirical analysis of the top ten Wikipedias has revealed that the stabilization of the
number of contributions from logged authors in Wikipedia during 2007 has influenced the evolution of the project, breaking down the steady growing rate of previous years...\
> Unfortunately, this results raise several important concerns for the Wikipedia project. Though we do not have empirical data from 2008, the change in the trend of births and deaths [new & inactive editors] will clearly decrease the number of available logged authors in all language versions, thus cutting out the capacity of the project to effectively undertake revisions and improve contents. Even more serious is the slightly decreasing trend that is starting to appear in the monthly number of births of most versions. The rate of deaths, on the contrary, does not seem to leave its ascending tendency. Evaluating the results for 2008 will be a key aspect to validate the hypothesis that this trend has changed indeed, and that the Wikipedia project needs to put in practice more aggressive measures to attract new users, if they do not want to see the monthly effort decrease in due course, as a result of the lack of human authors."^[pg 136, "4.4 Demographic Analysis of the Wikipedia Community"]

Ortega notes indications that this is a pathology unique to En:

> "In the first place, we note the remarkable difference between the English and the German language versions. The first one presents one of the worst survival curves in this series, along with the Portuguese Wikipedia, whereas the German version shows the best results until approximately 800 days. From that point on, the Japanese language version is the best one. In fact, the German, French, Japanese and Polish Wikipedias exhibits some of the best survival curves in the set, and only the English version clearly deviates from this general trend. The most probable explanation for this difference, taking into account that we are considering only logged authors in this analysis, is that the English Wikipedia receives too contributions from too many casual users, who never come back again after performing just a few revisions."^[_ibid_. pg 137]

Remember, most measures are directed against casual users.

## No club that would have me

This result will come as no surprise to longtime [inclusionists](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism). The deletion process deletes [most articles](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:AFD_100_days") which enter it, and has long been complained about by outsiders. Entire communities (such as the [web comics](!Wikipedia "Webcomic")^[See [Slashdot](!Wikipedia)'s ["Call For Halt To Wikipedia Webcomic Deletions"](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/31/0328239) for an overview.] or [MUD](!Wikipedia "MUD") online communities^[["MUD history dissolving into the waters of time"](http://www.massively.com/2009/01/06/mud-history-dissolving-into-the-waters-of-time/)]) have been alienated by purges of articles - purges which not infrequently result in abuse of process, much [newbie biting](!Wikipedia "Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers"), and comical spectacles like AfD regulars (usually deletionists) insisting a given article is absolutely non-notable and leading world experts in the relevant field demurring; a particularly good AfD may see statements of experts dismissed on speciously procedural grounds such as having been made in the expert's blog (and so failing WP:RS).

And imagine how the authors must feel! An article is not a trivial undertaking; sometime sit down, select a random subject, and try to write a well-organized, fluent, comprehensive, and accurate encyclopedia article on it. It's not as easy as it looks, and it's even harder to write a well-referenced and correctly formatted one. To have an article deleted is bad enough; I can't imagine any neophyte editors wanting to have anything to do with Wikipedia if an article of theirs got railroaded through AfD.

And ironically, the more effort an editor pours into a topic and the longer & more detailed the article becomes, the more blind hatred it seems to inspire in deletionists. I call this the *[fancruft](!Wikipedia) effect*: deletionists are mentally allergic to information they do not care about or like.

If a deletionist sees an article on "Lightsaber combat" and it's just a page long, then he has little problem with it. It may strike him as too big, but reasonable. But if the article dares to be comprehensive, if it is clearly the product of many hours' labor on the part of multiple editors, if there are touches like references and quotes - then the universe is out of joint, that this article has been so well-developed when so many more deserving topics languish is a cosmic injustice. A dirty beggar is parading around acting like an emperor. The article *does not know its place*. It needs to be smacked down and hard. And who better to exercise that power than the deletionist?

> "The greatest pleasure is to vanquish your enemies and chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth and see those dear to them bathed in tears, to ride their horses and clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters."[^khan]

Outsiders! I realize it might sound like a stretch that anyone enjoys the power of nominating articles, that being a deletionist could be a joyful role. You say you understand how administrators (with their ability to directly delete, to ban, to rollback etc.) could grow drunk on power, but how could AfD nominations lead to such a feeling?

But I know from personal experience that there is power exercised in nominating for deletion. Well do I know the dark arts of gaming the system: of the clever use of templates, of the process of deleting the article by carefully challenging and removing piece after piece, of invoking the appropriate guidelines and policies to demolish arguments and references.

I have seen the wails and groans in the edit summaries & comments of my opponents, and exulted in their defeat. It's very real, the temptation of exercising this power. It's easy to convince yourself that you are doing the right thing, and merely enforcing the policies/guidelines as the larger community set them down. Were all my nominations just? No, but I have succeeded in fooling myself so well that I can no longer tell which ones truly did deserve deletion and which ones were deleted just because I disliked it.

Who can say how many authors take it personally? The deletion process is inherently insulting: "Out of 2.5 million articles, yours stands out as sucking so badly that it is irredeemable and must be obliterated."

# What Is To Be Done

Wikipedia was enabled by software. It enabled a community to form. This community did truly great work; it's often said Wikipedia is historic, but I think most people have lost sight of how historic Wikipedia is as it fades into the background of modern life; perhaps only scholars of the future have enough perspective on this leviathan, in the same way that Diderot's encyclopedia was - for all the controversy and banning - not given its full due at publication. (But how could it? Encyclopedias are more processes than finished works, and of no encyclopedia is this more true than Wikipedia.)

That community did great work, astonishing in breadth and depth, I said. But that community is also responsible for misusing the tools. If vandalism is easier to remove than create, then it will tend to disappear. But AfD is not vandalism. There are no technical fixes for deletionist editors. As long as most editors have weak views, are willing to stand by while 'nerdy' topics feel the axe, who think 'deletionists mostly get it correct', then the situation will not change.

Could deletion be a positive feedback cycle? Will the waves of deletion continue to encourage editors to leave, to not sign up, to let the deletionists continue their grisly work unopposed, until Wikipedia is a shell of what it was?

Like the cooling dwarf star left by a supernova, its lost brilliance traveling onwards to eternity.
