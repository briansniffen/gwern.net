title: Amelia's Trattoria
---

On the corner of Harvard St., near Tech Square, is a tiny Italian
restaurant.  I used to go there a bunch when I worked in Tech Square,
but haven't been in several years.  In that time, Amelia's has
reinvented itself.  They still have some of the same dish *names* that
I remembered, but make them entirely differently.

There's still a calamari appetizer.  But it's no longer the
traditional greaseballs of squid with pepper.  Now it's served over a
lemon risotto, with an incredible salty-garlic oil.  There's still
gnocchi, but these are among the best gnocchi I've tasted.

Even the coffee's better.  I have no idea if it's improved this much
for lunch: the office-worker crowd is looking for something different.
But the dinner food is absolutely incredible.  This is the best food
I've eaten when I didn't start the meal with a migraine.
