title: East of the Sun, West of the Moon, by John Ringo
---

Orks in Space!  This is the fourth book in the *Council Wars* series,
which began with the aptly future-tense *There Will Be Dragons*.  It
is a Baen book.  It is by John Ringo.  This is almost all you need to
know.

Herzer Herrick makes his usual dashing appearance.  Edmund has only
bit-parts.  Some of the microgravity physics seems a little bit
off... but given the nano-built orcs and Dark Elves, it seems
ridiculous to complain.  There's a lot of fun adventure, though less
than in the earlier books.  More time is spent on character
development of Herzer and Megan.  The integration of their personal
lives with the great war is executed with more grace and capability
than previously shown.

This book is noticeably shorter than its brothers, and more of its
bulk is spent on tables of organization embedded in the text.  Much
like the Posleen War series, I'm starting to worry around book
four---but Ringo's learned a lot since his excellent start, so I hope
he'll surpass *Hell's Faire* and *Cally's War* with the Council Wars.
