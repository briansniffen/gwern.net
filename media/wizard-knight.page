---
title: The Knight and The Wizard, both by Gene Wolfe
---

I am proud of my abilities with language, and seek always to improve.
If I can ever reach Gene Wolfe's skill, I will have ascended to a new
world.

These are two volumes of one story, *The Wizard Knight*.  Don't wait a
long time between reading them: it really is one novel, split for
publishing reasons.  This is a fantasy epic in the same group with
*Song of Ice and Fire*.  It's hard to say it's like Tolkien, because
he did it first---but Wolfe here demonstrates that George Martin has
collaboration.  May their separate attempts to revitalize the fantasy
genre succeed!

The story is that of Able, a boy from our world, who is drawn by the
faeries into a magical realm.  Wolfe establishes a novel cosmology of
seven realms, from the Heaven of the Most High God to the Niflheim of
the most low god.  Between lie Elysium, an Asgard-inspired Skai, the
central human realm of Mythgartr, fey Aelfheim, and dragon-flamed
Muspel.  Ties of veneration and obligation connect them.  The
cosmology is sufficient to enthrall, and is fully examined over the
story.  Able visits many of the worlds, interacts directly with beings
from six of the seven, and significantly changes the reader's opinion
of the relationship between them.  In many ways, the story is an
excuse to re-examine the relationship between duty, happiness, desire,
and worship.  It says something about how adults should act in front
of children, and the verdict of history.

Along the way, it's a very enjoyable story.  It jumps a bit too
quickly for my taste in some places---a feature I've noted while
reading other Wolfe books.  He wants to get to the point, and
sometimes it's a bit jarring.  You never know whether the end of a
chapter will flow directly into the beginning of the next or skip a
few months, though a chapter ending on a cross-world trip is usually a
good clue.

This is a much more accessible introduction to Wolfe than the Book of
the New Sun, but I find it hard to recommend one over the other.
