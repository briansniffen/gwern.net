title: Storm Front, by Jim Butcher
---

Some MITSFS residents reacted to my not having read Storm Front the
way I reacted to someone who'd never read anything by Asimov.
Apparently the *Dresden Files* series has become quite popular.  I
think Glen Cook's cover blurb sums it up well: "I wish I'd thought of
this."

I'm not sure Dresden Files does bear comparison to Cook's own Garrett
Files.  There's more character development than in any one of Cook's
stories, but I haven't seen enough of Harry Blackstone Copperfeld
Dresden to compare him to the Garrett of nine books.  The clearest
comparison in my mind is to Laurel K. Hamilton's *Anita Blake*
books---there's even structural similarity to her first book, *Guilty
Pleasures*.  The universe is intriguing, and if Butcher explores the
Nevernever more deeply in later books, it'll be worth following.
