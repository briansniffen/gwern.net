# May 24, 2005; London, England

My first sight of foreign lands, all cloud-beshrouded! The jet lag is beginning to kick in, but Virgin Airlines's accommodations are fairly nice, so howe staved it a bit.

Impressions:

- found what Iowerth was referring to; Tories planning on holding the line of spending should they win the 2005 general elections
- Smoking! I thought Europe was more, not less, healthy than America
- Prices - the only places trading quality for price are American chains. Seems like a race to the top!
- Newsies. Quite confusing. Men have little stalls that give-away/sell only one newspaper; bizarre!
- London itself: very pedestrian friendly, but somehow both shabby-dirty & classy-clean.

    The emptiness of the city, especially the financial district, is quite uncanny and eerie later in the day. The arrangement of streets, buildings, and parks is quite complex and chaotic - but charming.
- Best sight: Tower of London. Awesome fortifications, very beautiful.

    Neal Stephenson's _Baroque Cycle_ was misleading viz. its size and confusing interior. Saw the Ravens and Crown Jewels; amused by former, disgusted and horrified by the greed and rapaciousness of the British monarchs. They should be shot and the British people slapped for perpetrating that institution.
- Security! Are the British all paranoiacs?!

    I routinely saw police carrying what looked to be automatic assault rifles! Every building was barricaded with pointy iron! There were 'cameras and warnings of cameras' literally everywhere! 'Twas the rare bird that lacked'em. The signs & ads posted were positively neurotic! They said: 'unattended luggage is almost certainly a bomb! Call the police now!' 'We no longer need any reason to investigate or ruin your life - fear us!' Barmy, I tells you. What's their excuse? The IRA is disbanding.

That said, in a few days I'd've had a tooting good accent. Too bad we left too soon, and too bad I lost my wallet in a fancy pizza place just before we went to Harrods. (I eventually got it back; a cheap cautionary lesson.)

# 26 March; Paris, France

Disappointed. Paris is dingy and dark. I really hope that it is due to it being winter. Thoughts:

- less security: an example being sloppy exit security at Versailles. Refreshing after London's paranoia
- See previous note about British Crown Jewels. Multiply by about a thousand to capture my dudgeon at Versailles.
- lots o' graffiti, and amazing number of African and Arabic-looking types around
- The little shops have remarkably good food
- So many people speak English! A very pleasant surprise, saves me from inflicting my French on them.
- Many American video games, like _World of Warcraft_ and _GTA 4: San Andreas_. Strange.
- Louis^[The only other boy on the trip; he's shorter than me, but more outgoing.] thinks everyone is a tad unfriendly. I say it is merely the language barrier. We shall see in Belgium & Holland.
- American songs are very popular. Guess their complaints of cultural imperialism are somewhat justified.
- The current issue of _Newsweek_, which in the States has a portrait of Jesus on the cover, is here a lead article on President Mugabe of Zimbabwe. My advice to fledgling mystery cults: "don't foul your own nest".
- Louvre: large, confusing, ridiculous amounts of art and very full.

    I expected the cashiers to have better English, though, no fun being yelled at in French for not having exact change. The Egyptian and ancient Mesopotamia collections are the best I've ever seen. The Mona Lisa was nice, and photos don't really capture the haziness, the swirling smokiness, and greenness of the actual thing.
- St. Michel's square: the choked winding alleys have some of the best sorbet I've ever eaten. (I also remember fondly the Dijon mustard that exploded in my mouth and sinuses, and the orange-glazed duck. I don't remember the hour-long wait in the tiny restaurant.)
- Mont-martre: The artist's square was interesting because of the 20 or so starveling artists desperate to sketch or portray you. The shops sucked, though. Actually, as shops went, Paris was worse than London, except in the areas of food & clothing. (And even food wasn't too great; I begged to go into an enormous grocery store to see what teas they had, and came out disappointed with one small canister which turned out to be very mediocre when I finally got home.)

# 29 March; Bruge, Belgium & Amsterdam, Holland

An excellent day. We had considerable sleep, and our feet were recovered nicely since we had a long night and a morning on the bus.

We left Paris, and I was not sorry to go; the food did not compensate enough for all the other problems. I was more than a little trepidatious about our visit to the Low countries, since they spoke Dutch and Flemish, and I (and essentially everyone else except our tourguide John, a remarkably knowledge man, learned in both high and low areas. To my shame, he knows American culture better than I) have not even the smattering of them I do of French.

But to my amazement, we soon learned that just about everybody speaks remarkably good English! On the whole, they were easier than some of the thicker British accents, believe it or not. We discovered this at Bruges (Brugge locally).

- Random note: When traveling, bring at least two disposable cameras for each city

Brugge was in a word, awesome, easily my (and most fellow travelers) favorite place. It is a remarkably picturesque place to live, and an absolute tourist mecca, partially because as I have said, it seems everyone in the Low Lands speak English (I find it uncertain whether it is similar to the Asian enthusiasm for English or whether they rather like it; I noticed many Dutch spoke in a polyglot of Dutch, German, and especially English, and many TV channels featured American shows and movies - often unsubtitled, including a positively antique episode of _Gilmore Girls_; all of which is abetted by a very effective foreign-language instruction institution.) and are extremely friendly. Bruges especially is a friendly-to-tourist town, and not in a ton-of-kitshy-overpriced-crap-shops way (like the ones in New York City around Times Square or Paris on the Champs Elysee); Brugge felt genuine. I had a Belgium waffle with French vanilla (of course) ice cream. (Excellent. Their reputation is well-deserved. I also bought some really dark Belgian chocolate, and found a very nice coffee & tea store which had several dozen varieties of loose leaf tea! I bought some green tea and Formosa oolong. All of which I have high hops for.)

- Note to self: After trip, ask Sandy whether the jasmine tea turned out well
- Random note: Sandy was one of the girls I was complaining of earlier about profligacy and an inordinate love of tourist-trap shops; eg. one day in Paris, Sandy, that foolish, tall, fairly buxom young blonde, spent over â‚¬100 - before 5 PM!

My regrets for Brugge are as follows:

1. We didn't spend much time there. I would gladly have cut the Champs d'Elysees out of the schedule, especially considering 'the incident', if we could have spent a full day in Brugge
2. I did not get to climb the clock tower, or see the relic in one of the churches which claimed to be a phial of Jesus of Nazareth's blood
3. There was a gallery/shop devoted to a Belgian comics master named Hegre, and especially to _Tin-Tin_, a show which aired on Nick and of which I have fuzzy yet fond memories. (But not enough to really look.)

- Note to self: return to Brugge one day
- Random note: In London, the hotel bathroom's faucets were activated by stepping on a button on the floor. That is an efficient and sanity method.
- Random note: In the Low Countries, almost by default the hotel newspapers were English ones like _The International Tribune_

All too soon we left Brugge and arrived in Amsterdam.

- Random note: As I write this, approaching St. John's Island on my transcontinental airplane flight (back to the US), I am struck by the beauty of how the clouds shadow the water, the beautiful water, when they are separated enough to see the Atlantic. Why have I never seen this before?

Amsterdam (Dam-on-the-Amster) seemed like a more real city than Paris or Brugge. My initial impression was a feeling of at-home-ness. What local paper I read definitely seemed far more in accord with my own current political and social views than most places. The marijuana and sex reports of Amsterdam are greatly exaggerated. Not once did I see the redlight district (aside from more brazen displays of sexually-oriented merchandise than usual in large cities) or witness someone lighting up.

I might have, had I gone to one of the 'smart shops', which seemed rather interesting. Apparently they vend mind-altering (in some way, not necessarily hallucinogenic; caffeine or theobromine I would classify as mind-altering, for example) substances such as (obviously) marihauana, ketamine, _salvia something_, and an array of supplements. I should have liked to go in and buy a few of the safest ones for importing and experimenting with at home (obviously no scheduled drugs! Even if I wanted to risk the drug itself, we were warned in no uncertain terms that customs were especially strict about young people coming from Holland, which I could believe since I've read of many foolish visitors to the Netherlands being later arrested) such as hydergine. Unfortunately, our free shopping times, locations, and the locations of the smart shops never quite conspired to allow it.

Ah well. Next time. A cheap supply of melatonin would have been nice.

- Random regret: That in London I foolishly lost my wallet at that gourmet pizza place, just before we all went to Harrods. *Gott ver dammt!*

We visited Anne Frank's house, which was touching because it was remarkable how effectively Anne's diaries could be used: the place was a triumph of multimedia presentation and a tooting good propaganda piece.

Also visited a diamond factory where Buehler's sister bought a ring. Foolish American! The tour was considerably better than the 'tour' at the Fragonard Perfume outlet in paris, in that we received a decent explanation and could watch two employees polish some small 1-karat stones. It was amusing to see how they would press the tiny diamond to the rotating diamond-dusted flywheel and an instant later whip it up to inspect it with a jeweler's loupe. And like Fragonard's, it ended with a sampling of their more lucrative wares, but before that we could see some of the more remarkable gems, thanks to the magic of their pneumatic tube system. Alas, my request to see a blue diamond was impossible to fulfill - they had none at the time. The girls certainly enjoyed looking at all the loose stones and earrings.

After all that, we went out to a museum village and a fishing town (that latter of which was a gaping waste of time). At the village, we learned how they make cheese (pretty much as you'd expect) and also their famous wooden shoes (though an ingenuous 'lathe copier' as I dubbed it, in which a rod traced out the original on the copy, which is simultaneously being cut/bored by the drill.) I bought some herbal cheese and an excellently fitting pair of unpainted clogs. I plan to sand them very well, shape the bottom, and maybe put in orthopedic soles to cushion the wood; after which I shall paint them. Precisely what is uncertain (I am thinking that a tiger's head on the front, in the manner of fighter jets, and a tiger strip scheme on the rest),

But Weinutz (Dean of Discipline, whom I formerly hated, but actually turns out to be good-natured and genial outside of school) has said he would give me a dress code exemption when I wore the painted clogs to school... if I dared.

Other than that, we went on a canal boat ride (spoiled by the damned girls, who in the last days went more than a little daft and noisy. Too much excitement, no doubt.), slept, and flew home without issue.

All in all, a remarkably satisfactory trip.
