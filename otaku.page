Date is whenever a source was *created*, not when it was *published* or otherwise disseminated.

1. Primary is material from someone who worked on a object of interest: eg. Hideaki Anno or Hiroyuki Yamaga. (I include Japanese seiyuu because as Asuka's last line shows, they have direct input, or as Ritsuko's last line shows, special insight.)
2. Secondary is a source from someone who knows Primaries first-hand: eg. Carl Horn or Toshio Okada.
3. Tertiary is any source further removed than that - mainstream news coverage, academic analysis, fan speculation & analysis etc.: eg. Mari Kotani, David Samuels, Aaron Clark.

Source is based on the ultimate origins of information, not proximate; an email forwarding an anonymous fan translation of a Anno interview in a Japanese book is considered primary, not tertiary. Some people or materials shift statuses; eg. Carl Horn is sometimes recording Anno (primary), statements by Hiroyuki Yamaga (secondary), or his own interpretations (tertiary). It is usually clear which classification applies best.

> Animage: What would you recommend?

> Anno: Shows like Yamato or Gundam (1979, TV) which have soul, emit the staff's "cry of mind" out of the screens as a certain vibration. On the other hand, I feel bad when I watch shows that are made sluggishly without such soul.
>
...
> Anno: Of the movies, I recommend Gundam III - Meeting in Space. The picture is quite nice. Moreover, if I have to recommend Mr. Tomino's animation, I would choose Legendary Giant IDEON (1980, TV). It would be best to watch the movie version's Part II (1982, movie) after watching the TV series. Although some of the picture quality might be poor, please tolerate it.

...
> Anno: Yes, I did, although it is a little bit light. I was just overwhelmed by its adult mood throughout the animation. I can't express such mood yet. Actually, I felt sad when I watched Nadia, which I directed, soon after watching it. I felt Nadia was too childish. (laughs)

### Early Evangelion

#### Project Meeting

>" *Preliminary Meeting*
>
>[Theme]
>
> Before the birth of the human race, there twice existed prehistoric civilizations with advanced technology. The first civilization (the First Ancestral Race) created the EVA, but because of this they were destroyed. The next civilization (the Second Ancestral Race) created the Spears of Longinus, thus successfully containing the EVA; afterwards, as a countermeasure to anyone reviving the EVA, they planted Angels all over the world.
>
>[Analysis]
>
> At this stage EVA are not to be considered “man-made”, but beings resurrected by the Ancestral Races. Hence, the Angels exist largely to destroy the EVA and remove traces of their presence in the case of their revival. However, it goes without saying that very similar themes are to be found in some of Director Anno’s works such as “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind” and “Nadia”. Ancient civilizations that boasted great technology are a typical theme found in Science Fiction anime. At this stage, it is difficult to imagine works with the same level or originality and complexity coming after EVA."

#### Evangelion Proposal

> Also, in the Eva production timeline in the Collectors BoxSet, Anno proposed the first in-house draft of "Evangelion" to Gainax for consideration on September 20, 1993 -- over two years before the start of the series.
>
> The Series Plan (2nd draft) and plot/synopsis of all 26 episodes was submitted on January 5 of the following year (1994), and for the most part "fixed" (in-house) the following month on February 4.  The Planning Draft for external distribution was completed in April of that same year -- a year and a half before the start of the series.
>
> Production work for Ep.1 was completed in April 1995, and Ep.2 in May 1995, but the opening and ending sequences were not finished until September.

This is the basis of this story and the great international project known as “The Human Complementary Plan.” Half a century ago, we developed nuclear fusion. Next up for mankind, who can store the sun in the palm of his hand, is a complementary plan to create the “perfect human” with their own hands. The goal is to liberate all of mankind by scientifically re-creating “the tree of life” forbidden by God, by taking away “death” from man, and by freeing him from the original sin and the curse that plagues him. The one who is advocating and recommending this plan is Gendo Ikari, the father of the main character. Through “artificial evolutionary research,” he is single-mindedly pursuing the form of a human who has achieved the ultimate evolution…

> GAINAX, the studio that created Gunbuster, was made up of fans who really--I mean really--knew anime. They were out to have as much fun with it as possible, and break a few boundaries while they were at it. They were the best anime has ever seen. Look at their short film that opened Daicon IV, following that up with the incredible four-minute ROYAL SPACE FORCE, the film that got them the funding for their masterpiece (and only feature film) THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE. With NADIA and GUNBUSTER, they demonstrated they could produce classics in the TV and OAV genres as well. In their coda, OTAKU NO VIDEO, they made anime's great _roman a clef_, closing the circle for anime fans and exiting in style.

>  "So why did Evangelion wind up with that shape?" I figure that from now on I will hear that question countless times. The director instructed me to make, "the image of a demon [_oni_]." A giant just barely under the control of mankind. I get the feeling I've seen that correlation before... The image I had for the design concept was the fairy tale, Gulliver's Travels.

> In the end, Leiqunni's attempt to isolate herself from a world she regards as evil is no more productive than Shiro's initial refusal to even consider good and evil in the world (that's why I prefer to render his opening line as "I don't know if it's good or bad" although one could say "For better or worse"). HONNEAMISE is a film advocating anti-detachment.
>
...
>
> Yamaga has not merely jerked Shiro's strings to commit this act--indeed, the act derives from choice and serves to illustrate that Shiro *knows* he has a choice--Leiqunni believes *she has none.* Leiqunni believes in original sin, that "all are guilty." But if one is guilty from birth, the entire concept of "sin" as a choice becomes meaningless, for we are evil--indeed, doomed, by nature and can do nothing but ask for grace.
>
> But Shiro doesn't believe this is true. His prayer at the end comes only after a long string of conscious choices, actions, and decisions on his part. He prays not out of a belief that God's mercy is the only thing that can save the helplessly evil human race--on the contrary, his prayer is based on the careful observation of humanity's historical record: full of choices that led to slaughter. And yet, he simultaneously recognizes that the same human race has made it here, to "God's space"--what used to be thought of as Heaven. What he beseeches, then, is a light to mankind--"In our despair, give us one, fixed star." A beacon of *truth*--to remind us that we always have a *choice.*
>
> The more I look at HONNEAMISE, the more convinced I am that Yamaga knew what he was doing. The film holds with [Andre] Gide's warning: "Do not understand me too quickly." Whether the necessity for the viewer to go back again to fully comprehend it, will be a liability in its release here--I don't know--there is so much one can get from the first viewing only. But in that endurance, the viewer discovers that which endures: the art of THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE. The film is Yamaga's choice--and also, still, a light to anime--a genre that doesn't believe in itself as it should...

>
>> 'Four years after Nadia, I began to think it would be fun to write and plan a manga. At the time I had no experience in that area, but it was something I really wanted to try. Everyone wanted to see my previous work or sales figures, but I had nothing that would prove I was a bona fida comic creator'
>
> The approaching release of Gainax's new series gave Sadamoto that chance to prove himself.
>
> Resisting the doubts of his Gainax colleagues, Sadamoto took the scripts and storyboards for the TV episodes, and began producing 24 pages a month for Shonen Ace magazine.
>
>> 'When I started on the manga, we'd only plotted about five or six episodes, so I didn't have too much of an idea where we were going. We hadn't even decided what colour Evangelion was going to be, or how to design the cockpit! Also, although I was very well acquainted with certain characters through my assignments as a designer, I had to immerse myself in the rest of the Evangelion universe, in whose creation I hadn't been so closely involved.'
>
> For this reason, the first few issues of the manga kept extremely close to the TV storyline. But Sadamoto was already using the manga to play up his own interests, accentuating elements that might have passed the viewing audience by.
>
> In the manga version, the first shot of the underwater angel attack shows  it drifting past the submerged hulk of the Gainax building. The character of Doctor Ikari is slightly more sympathetic: the Sadamoto version permits him a relieved smile when Shinji agrees to pilot the Evangelion. It also puts the early episodes back into chronological order, ditching the anime's flashback approach which saves Shinji's first battle until the end of episode two.
>
>> 'Of course I wanted to add as much to it as I could,' says Sadamoto, 'and to try and make the manga version slightly different. The TV series is very much dominated by Hideaki Anno and the staff, but the manga is a "Sadamoto Brand" product, because I've been able to devote myself to it.'
>
> Sadamoto recognised early that the anime team would always have more success with the moving, full-colour battle scenes, and so concentrates more on the characters' thoughts and feelings. Consequently, there is more in the manga on the psychological damage suffered by the pilots, and extra scenes of Shinji recuperating in the hospital. Most notably, there is a cycle of dream sequences in which Shinji encounters his mother, only to see her transform into a fearsome Evangelion machine."

This is hard to imagine today, but at that point (July 1996)  the series had been over for two months, yet many American fans still hadn't seen it--not because they didn't want to, but because there was as yet no digital distribution of anime, fan or licensed--only by getting a physical copy of the tape could you watch it. This limited the speed at which an audience could grow, of course, and ADV's version was not yet on the market. Anno said a few things at the AX'96 panel that have been remembered, but what I find most interesting is "when asked about Evangelion's last two episodes, which upset many fans, Anno cooly replied, 'I have no problem with them. If there's a problem, it's all with you guys. Too bad.'" I'm not absolutely sure (it may be in my transcription notes) but I think Anno might have said "too bad" in English, presumably for emphasis."

In other words, we're offering viewers to think by themselves, so that each person can imagine his/her own world. We will never offer the answers, even in the theatrical version. As for many Evangelion viewers, they may expect us to provide the 'all-about Eva' manuals, but there is no such thing. Don't expect to get answers by someone. Don't expect to be catered to all the time. We all have to find our own answers."

These 3 books were published 1996-1997; they were used by the [Literal Translation Project](http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~onizuka/literal/evangelion.html) but as the LTP and Amazon.com reviews say, they are not the final scripts that actually aired as anime. They seem to be nearly-final drafts - they include a number of dialogue changes and occasional deleted scenes. They are largely untranslated except for:

- [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-August/030966.html) paraphrases a section in episode 19 where Eva-01 eats the S2 Engine of an angel
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-September/020217.html) translates a deleted scene in episode 18 where Touji visits his sister in the hospital, a modified scene between Ritsuko & Misato, and a modified scene in episode 3.
- [Shin-seiki](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=116702#116702) says episode 03, "Hedgehog's Dilemma: Rain, after running away", was originally titled "Hedgehog's Dilemma: The Wandering Third Children"
- [Reichu](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=196289#196289) mentions that episode 17 originally mentions an 'Essene' organization rather than 'Seele', fitting in with [the storyboard](http://www.evacommentary.org/op/op_2.html#cut044) and [NAveryW](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=196222#196222)'s spotting of the word [Essene](!Wikipedia) in a ['Project Meeting'](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=196081#196081) document (a brainstorming session apparently predating the Evangelion Proposal; see [Project Meeting](#project-meeting).)
- [NAveryW](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=368599#368599) quotes a translation by Eric Blair in #evageeks of an important Misato line from episode 21: "I know the Angels aren't just battle weapons left by the First Root Race." [Reichu](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=410193#410193) transcribes the kanji and translates them as "I know the Angels aren't just weapons left behind by the First Indigenous Race."

    (This is one of the few solid leads that the First Ancestral Race was not invented for the video games but were part of the backstory early on.)
- [CuSO4](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-May/014267.html) confirms that episodes 13 and 14 were mistakenly swapped
- [Savant](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-June/015718.html) discusses the Chinese version, confirming Reichu's description of the marginalia and quotes one such comment: "This script portrays Shinji as being more 'soft' than in the finished series."

> The general idea is that Anno suffered a kind of breakdown after the series finished. During this time he continued to live at Gainax and didn't want to return to his home. The story of the "suicide attempt" comes from Anno climbing up to the roof of the Gainax building and sticking his foot out over the edge to see if he would jump off. He wanted to figure out whether or not he really wanted to die. In the end he didn't jump off, so deep down he wanted to live."

> Anno commented in various interviews after the conclusion of the series that "anime fans need to have more self-respect" and to "come back to reality"; in a Newtype interview on 10 May, after the announcement on 26 April of a new movie and re-edited versions of the TV series, he also stated that "computer networking is graffiti on toilet walls."

> When I heard that EVANGELION was censored (see our article "Evangelion Controversy" on page 45), I was totally outraged. How this could be possible in our modern world? And all this (we speculated) in the name of religious belief? What about free speech? How could a legal system go along with this? Well, maybe it did not and the TV station censored the show itself to avoid offending certain sensibilities. We cannot really know where the truth lies. I was particularly confused when my friend Miyako read me Hideaki Anno's interview in NEWTYPE of June. He avoided the subject of censorship and skillfully defended his work. His point of view made sense and he made some interesting comments about the Internet fans who excessively criticized the show.
>
> "I think the people who are very much involved with the Net," Mr. Anno said, "have very narrow views toward life and the world. They're always in their rooms and don't go out very often to communicate in person. Because of their information on the Net, they feel they know everything without searching the real truths." They easily and anonymously say things that they would never say in person. "Their messages are like graffiti in a public toilet." They attack other while they are staying in a safe place. "They don't have anything certain to hold on... that's probably why they watch anime shows. (...) I would like to add and say to those fans, hey, go out and visit towns. I am 35 now and I am realizing the importance of human contact little by little..."

> (This interview, published in the June issue of NEWTYPE, was made by Mr. Shinichiro Inoue. He encourages people to send comments and questions to Anno-san by writing to: Mr. Hideaki Anno, Monthly NEWTYPE Magazine, Kadokawa Shoten, Tokyo, 162-77, Japan.)

  --<http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/edito41.htm>

> "To update on the EVANGELION controversy, nothing really came out from Anno-san at Anime Expo. He seemed embittered, and quickly lost patience with the fans. "If you don't understand, it is your problem", he said! He made many comments in such terms that our reporter on location couldn't put them on paper. For more details, check our report on Anime Expo in the next issue. Anyway, someone who worked on EVANGELION did confirm that the last episodes (from 19 and on, but mainly 25-26) were censored following pressure from the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association; but no mention of any legal action) and that they had been botched.

## S

> The television broadcasts were finished two months ago. But "Eva fever" has not yet cooled down. As a matter of course, there was also a big reaction to the interview with Anno Hideaki in the June issue of NT (Newtype). It seems like bunches of letters are delivered to the editorial office daily for Director Anno, which he is reading little by little as his busy schedule permits
['From Newtype, July 7, 1996 issue'](http://web.archive.org/web/20001212215800/www.acsys.com/~tallman/ecom_e.html) ("Note: this is still a rough translation.")

> However, despite being made as a group operation, there are TV series that are colored almost entirely by the personality of one individual. Hayao Miyazaki’s "Conan, Boy of the Future" is that way, and many of the series where Yoshiyuki Tomino served as chief director are also the same.
>
> "Neon Genesis Evangelion" is also a series that was shaped by the personality of its one creator, Hideaki Anno. The worldview, character creation, creation of Mecha, the gadgets, the division of cuts, and even to the point of each line of dialogue, everything is inscribed with the name of "Hideaki Anno." For example, the mental landscape of Anno.is, of course, reflected in the story, behavior patterns of the characters and the like. Anno’s mood is reflected and his intent is clear even in trivial places like the name of a department store or the brand of can coffee that appears.

> Those "thoughts" about a piece of work are, for the viewer, a bit of a sophisticated way of enjoying it. After viewing a piece of work, that work is assimilated in the viewer’s head through thinking, "Did that mean this?" and "Is that right?" and will go on to become the building block of thought. Being able to come across works that can be contemplated is an irreplaceable encounter.
>
> However, recently I feel that these encounters are scarce. I wonder if I’m just imagining this?
>
...
>
> Thinking requires effort. When anime is thought of as "entertainment", I’m not denying that there is also a policy that the audience not be made to use unnecessary effort. Works that are just to been seen and enjoyed. Those are also probably necessary. However, weren't there too many of those types of works? Among those, "Neon Genesis Evangelion" was clearly a work that could be thought about. While keeping its entertainment value as a piece of work, it also offers enjoyment that the audience thinks about. The Eva Boom that you all know about proves that. Everyone is starving for thinking.
>
> And the story pregnant with riddles concluded, for many of the audience members, still pregnant with those riddles. There were also fans who screamed, "I was betrayed" by that ending. However, this is also certain proof that Eva draws people in.

> In reaching the film’s completion, it might also be interesting to try reading about things like how the drama was put together and corrected and how the implications continued to change.

I think the designer was just roughing out the NERV logo and perhaps at the time they were thinking of making an acronym, for an additional double meaning. In its place, they used the quote "God's in his heaven, all's right in the world" which (to me, anyway) works better than an acronym."

> This was part one of a four-part interview with the founding president of Gainax, Toshio Okada, conducted at Otakon '95, and should certainly be read as an alternate viewpoint to many of the events described in ["The Notenki Memoirs"](docs/2002-notenki-memoirs). It ran in Animerica 4:2 through 4:5, although Okada only touches on Eva in 4:2. At the time the interview was conducted, Evangelion was in production but had not yet aired, and Okada mentions episode 5 in the context of how Gainax (since he left) has gained more control over its scheduling. He also makes the interesting assertion that he was talking about "the base story of Neon Genesis Evangelion" with Anno back when he was still at the company (he dates his departure to 1992). Hiroyuki Yamaga would later respond to some of Okada's remarks in Animerica 6:5, but not those related to Eva (I don't believe Yamaga's 1997 and 1998 Fanime remarks on Eva ever appeared in Animerica, although I think Miyako Matsuda-Graham may have covered it for Protoculture Addicts).

> OKADA: I had a lot of fun making GUNBUSTER, but I didn't have that burning sensation when I made OTAKU NO VIDEO. It was something that I lightly made. I made it that way because I thought the people who watched it were like the people in the live-action portion--not the people who made it. 1983 was the turning point for myself and my friends. Basically what I wanted to do was set the stage for 1983 because that was when everything was changing; I wanted to show people what it was like during that period back in 1983, how we lived, basically, what our life was as otaku.
>
> PANEL: I'd like one more question, and then I'm going to open it up to everybody: There are many themes...I go back to OTAKU NO VIDEO--you talk a lot about, and it seems like you predicted in that film, a lot of the commercialization and product management that is now very, very common in the animation industry. Do you feel more strongly now about the way things have to be processed, and managed, and shoved out the door--you see all around you the selling of creativity?
>
> OKADA: That world we made in OTAKU NO VIDEO, it was not a prediction: it was an otaku's dream. Maybe we can be more major, or a bigger group, or maybe we can make our own theme parks! But in these days, I can't believe all of the things that are happening--our otaku's dreams are beginning to become a reality in the United States. I am very surprised, and very glad.

> AUDIENCE: Many Americans believe the line Kubo [OTAKU NO VIDEO] has concerning wanting to become the tyrannical king to be a reference to Nostradamus. We were wondering if it really is, and if Gainax was into other forms of Western occultism, like Masonry, or the Knights of Malta.

> OKADA: No, no! (waves dismissively at audience).
>
> PANEL: [TO AUDIENCE MEMBER] You're a bad boy!
>
> OKADA: The setting of 1983 is still the primary focus of OTAKU NO VIDEO, and the characters in that video during the time had seen the movie, NOSTRADAMUS: THE MAN WHO SAW THE FUTURE [narrated by Orson Welles-*ed.*]. Anyway, what it was, is that, their idea--that vision was so strong in their minds that they presented that story. And what I wanted to do was for people to see it, and make that, and say, "Oh, there are still people like this!" or, "Yes, that was the way it was back then."

> AUDIENCE: O.K....Do you feel it is easier for social outcasts to be creative, to invent original ideas?
>
> OKADA: That's right. Basically, creativity will not come out of happy lives, but from people who become outcasts. There is no reason for you to become *purposely* unhappy. 'Cause everybody who watches anime is happy--the people who watch it who are *not* happy, are the people who make it [LAUGHS]. It's not too good of a thing to make anime. I think a peaceful life is to take anime merchandise cheap from Japan, and then sell it expensively over here and/or work at Viz and make some weird American anime magazine. Very happy! [LAUGHS]

> OKADA: In THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE's story, that planet is six light years from our Earth. So, I told Mr. Yamaga, we should make a continuation story where their spaceship, not interplanetary, but interstellar, arrives here 100 years after the time of HONNEAMISE. So, they come to our Earth, and make contact with Earth. So, it is a continuity of that story. But it is very difficult to make. The plot I want to have, if I am to make a continuation of THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE, is to have the story of them making their own interstellar ship, And that ship will arrive in our solar system right about the time Earth is able to colonize Mars. Not a warp drive, but an acceleration ship.

> OKADA: Right now, he's an executive at Bandai Visual. And he still has a religion: he believes in Mamoru Oshii, just like Jesus Christ [PRAYS TO HEAVEN]. In those days, in 1983 or 1984, he asked of everything to Mr. Oshii: "Is it good, or is it bad?" And if Mr. Oshii said, "Oh, it's good!," so Mr. Watanabe would think, "Oh, it's good, it's good, I must make it, I must make it!" And then I told Mr. Watanabe, "I want to make this film, THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE," and he thinks, "I think it's a good idea, but I can't decide if it's *really* good. So--just a moment, I must go to Mr. Oshii's house" [RUNS IN PLACE; LAUGHS]. And Mr. Oshii says, "Oh-- it's interesting!" So, he thought, "It's good, it's good, it's good!" [LAUGHS] And it's a very powerful motivation for him, inside. So, he works very hard, and gets a very large budget for our film from the president of Bandai. So Mr. Oshii, he is a very good person for me, or for Studio Gainax, but...but...it is very strange to say, "Maybe it is good, but maybe it is not so good." It was a religion. But just now, Mr. Watanabe, he's come out of his brainwashing. So, he sometimes says: "Maybe...maybe, *maybe*, Mr. Oshii is sometimes wrong." [LAUGHS]

> OKADA: Not so. It's almost the same, from what I said to you at Otakon. You must remember that EVANGELION is produced at Tatsunoko, so the schedule is out of the control of Gainax--it's the responsibility of Tatsunoko. Tatsunoko almost rules, when it comes to control. So, I think, the responsibility was not with Gainax. People say, "It's the responsibility of Mr. Anno," but they're wrong. Control over schedule is the responsibility of the producer. But Tatsunoko and T.V. Tokyo couldn't handle it. It was out of Gainax's control.
>
> AUDIENCE: I talked to a person from Tatsunoko. He said he does not blame Mr. Anno, but he blames other people at Gainax, who might be telling Anno about his schedule, and--
>
> OKADA: Oh! I think producers always say that. But I talked with Mr. Anno about this a month ago, and then he said, "I'm *almost* the producer of EVANGELION, but I must be so, because Tatsunoko did not do anything for EVANGELION." See, he is very disappointed with Tatsunoko, and some rumors have said that Tatsunoko lost the film, or cels before they were shot.
>
> AUDIENCE: Wow!
>
> OKADA: And I asked Mr. Anno, "Is it the truth?" And he says, in a dark voice, "Yes."
>
> AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.
>
> OKADA: But that was in the middle of the episodes. That wasn't the trouble with the last two episodes, the confusion. It was just Mr. Anno's teleplay. He said to me, "I can make a schedule on my own." At that time, I heard from Mr. Anno about his new plans, so maybe you want to--?
>
> AUDIENCE: Of course.
>
> OKADA: After EVANGELION, his next plan is to make a STAR TREK. Not *that* STAR TREK--a sort of anime like STAR TREK, a crew in a spaceship, who go to every planet, and each planet has its own culture. For example, one planet will have a very democratic culture, and everyone will approve, so they'll board, or they say, "no," and they talk with the crew about everything. And the spaceship crew will sometimes fall in love in some way on the planet, or something will happen--*maybe* some robots fight [LAUGHS]. He wants to make that film, because Mr. Anno thinks it will be a very good experience for the Japanese animation world. But the sponsor says, "It's not so good,"

  --["Return of the Otaking"](http://web.archive.org/web/20001217163000/www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking8.html)

> OKADA: Right now, I think there's more than fifty people who work at Gainax. Most of these people work on making computer games, and half of them work on making CD-ROMs, such as the CD-ROM featuring Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's artwork. And there's maybe only two or three people who work on anime. The anime part of Gainax, I think, is Mr. Anno and Mr. Suzuki, and one other person. So, the animation department is very, very small. Most of the people in Gainax just now work on artwork CD-ROMs. When they make anime, they must join forces with another studio. It's a bad case of a company that's grown larger and larger--they have to make a lot of money every year, every month, so they have to make and sell a lot of CD-ROMs, because animation *loses* money. The case of EVANGELION, where they're actually *making* money, is something of a miracle, in the opinion of Gainax executives such as Hiroyuki Yamaga and Mr. Sadamoto, and not something they can expect as normal. They want to keep on making anime, but since it's unprofitable, they must make more CD-ROMs and computer games to balance things out. And so the computer game department gets larger and larger, and the animation department gets smaller and smaller. It's not good.

> OKADA: I think the style, or mood, of EVANGELION, is not so far, not so different, from the serious side of GUNBUSTER or NADIA. The biggest difference would have been in the style of planning the last episode. My style is to always plan the ending *first,* as I did with GUNBUSTER--everything then follows from that. In NADIA, Mr. Anno couldn't decide on the ending--it wasn't fixed until only three months before the final episode was shown. So subsequently, I was confused about NADIA, and there was a lack of control over the various episodes. EVANGELION is a very great series--I think it's one of the top anime ever made. But--the last scenes were never fixed. When I talked to Mr. Anno a month ago, he said he couldn't decide the ending until the time came. That's his style. So, if I had made EVANGELION with him, I couldn't do such a thing. I'd think I'd have to fix the ending, what would happen with every character. Then, everything would follow: the first episode, the second episode...If I wanted to show a boy's coming-of-age story, a *bildungsroman,* the last scene would show the grown-up man; the first scene, a boy who hates everything about the adult world. That would be the structure; I'm very careful about a regular construction. But Mr. Anno's style on EVANGELION was not so. He wants to put it together episode-by-episode. It's just like the style of a manga. In your typical manga, the artist doesn't have any picture of the last scene, or the last episode. They just think of building up on past episodes. And finally, the manga artist, and his assistants, and editor...[BURIES HEAD IN HANDS], they work out an idea about the last sequence. If it's a good idea, the whole episode is very good. If they can't make a good idea, the whole episode is not so good. It's an unhappy story. And I think that's what happened with the last two episodes of EVANGELION. Mr. Anno and his staff couldn't make a good idea for it. He told an anime magazine in Japan that he couldn't make what he wanted because of schedule or budget. But that's not correct. I talked with Mr. Yamaga and Mr. Anno. They said, "It's not only a problem of schedule or budget. It's a problem of what the ending is going to be." Mr. Anno couldn't decide. Mr. Anno's and my own style of production are very different.
>
...
>
> Because many anime and *seiyuu* magazines are asking Mr. Anno that question, and every time his answer changes. It's "confused, confuse-er, confuse-est." He's not happy right now. Maybe you know that back in January, or February, he shaved his head. It's a Japanese gesture of contrition. People said, "Oh, he's feeling a lot of responsibility towards the producer, or T.V. Tokyo, or the sponsor." Not so. He felt a very strong responsibility about *his* stuff. "Sorry, I can't do it!" So he shaved his head. This summer, he hates anime fans. I think he'll feel happier by autumn.

  [Aaron Clark](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=392551#392551) after reading above thread:

> "This reminds me of [Takeshi Honda](!Wikipedia "Takeshi Honda (animator)") at Katsucon many years back. He said that Anno constantly changed things. He changed many of the later episodes at the last minute, and that was so frustrating for him that he did not speak to Anno until after The End of Evangelion was completed."

> OKADA: Yeah, maybe that's right. Right now, many anime fans in Japan are fighting each other over whether that ending was good or bad. Some say, "Anno must feel no obligation towards the fans--he must make something true to himself." Many fans are fighting over this. Your question has come up in these debates. In my personal opinion, if he wanted to make such a statement, to say, "this is just fiction, and you should go back to the real world," he could do it a better way. If that's what he wanted to say, it's not necessary to make an anime to do it. But he's still an animator, and he wants to make another anime series. So his true mind does not say, "it's only animation, and I should go back to the real world." So I think Mr. Anno's confused just now.

> Shinji appears to be henpecked by Asuka. However, since he got very flustered when she slipped into his futon one night, and since he couldn't look straight at her figure in a sexy bathing suit, we may read between the lines that Shinji has feelings for her as a woman.

Misato is shown in this story to be the one with the greatest understanding of Shinji, the one who wants to be his guiding hand. Also, Shinji is the one who truly understands her pain.

> There's a peculiar thing Shinji does with his Super - DAT Walkman as early as the second episode of EVANGELION: he keeps switching back and forth between tracks 25 and 26 - the numbers of the final two episodes - and when those two episodes arrived, they were undoubtedly the most controversial hour of anime television in recent memory. The uproar over #25, " Do You Love Me? " and #26, " Take Care of Yourself, " was somewhat reminiscent of that over the final two episodes of the British 1960s TV classic THE PRISONER - a series which EVA had already made reference to in episode 4, when Shinji resigns temporarily from NERV. Like the conclusion of THE PRISONER, EVA's ending had a jerking, interrogative style, and seemed to suggest the show was about something else than what it appeared to be at the beginning - and even that the show's legions of fans should re - examine their motives for liking EVA in the first place. Complaints were so numerous over the conclusion that even many Japanese who didn't follow anime heard about the situation, and that this Gainax was a bunch of " bad boys. "

> "No sooner did EVA have its controversial TV ending that Gainax announced it would produce two *more* endings by the spring and summer of 1997: for the video and LD release, it would entirely remake the last two episodes, releasing them as a fourteenth two - episode volume after the first thirteen (as well as remake for the ongoing video release selected scenes in the latter part of the series it was dissatisfied with). There will be a two - part theatrical release to accompany it; one movie will be a compressed " digest " of the series' plot - the other will be the two new episodes. In addition to this, there will be an EVA theatrical movie with an entirely original plot and a *third* ending. Anno indicated at the Expo that these " additional " two endings would in fact really be the same ending as the final TV episode, but from different viewpoints."
>
...
>
> "Indeed, there seems to be evidence that Anno's dissatisfaction with the original conclusion was more with its often minimalist (if interestingly - handled) visuals, a result of running out of time and budget, than its writing per se: Toshio Okada, in last issue's " Return of the Otaking, " [LINK HERE - SUNDAY MORNING SECTION] spoke of Anno's ambitious plans for a CG - enhanced battle sequence in the remake. Okada also pointed out that Anno has tended to give different rationales concerning the remake, and of late Gainax's own publicity has rather coyly spoken of fan interest being the cause. "

>
> It's fair to say that Evangelion is a story which depicts "anxiety without a cause" which exhaustively ends with a convincing feeling of tension. It's clear that this kind of feeling is widespread when we look at the AUM incident and its repercussions. On this point, the work has a striking feeling of the present. However, the thing that we should pay closer attention to is the paradoxical whereby feelings of anxiety are always determined materialistically, but for the people who are caught in the center of this kind of anxiety, they can only experience it abstractly....
>
> One of my friends who is from Poland described his completely accurate impression of Rei as being related to the problems of post-war, in other words Rei is linked to the problems of Bosnia,etc. At the same time I thought that the room overlaps with a science laboratory, particularly a medical laboratory. Therefore, ANNO intersected images of refugees/ trauma with the "scientific" -- this is the only word that can accurately express the situation -- motif of stark anti-decorativeness. (After all, this would be linked to questions about AUM, more specifically to the problem of "Satyan," AUM's scientific laboratories) Rei's solitude is grounded in a completely tactile substantiality which gives us extremely realistic images of the discommunication that children of the present face. And these images of discommunication belong neither to Kogyal("child girl")-like autism nor to otaku-like autism which has been defined in opposition to Kogyal-like autism. (And these two types of autism are nothing more than the opposing gender extremities of post-modern decorativeness)
>
> Motifs such as charming beautiful girls and hi-tech machines which has strengthened the barrenness of anime, and in the end became important elements in his [Hideaki Anno's] work. It became crucial to articulate 90's-like problems through stereotypes and abstract motifs. To begin with "Evangelion" is an extremely otaku-like work which was by lots of details referenced from former anime and science fiction films, from the desing concept of cockpit to the brand of beer (Here in this aspect I don't have time to treat it, although it's important) In other words, it can be said that ANNO broke through the literary imagination of the 1980's by strongly mixing and re-editting the motifs of the anime-like imagination, which had been completely barren for some ten years....
>
> In the opening scene of "Evangelion" he already inserts a cut of a character which had initially been introduced in the 24th episode. The countless devices of this type means that Anno started the broadcast after conceiving the total structure pretty clearly [indeed?]. Actually, the speed of the narrative development of numerous foreshadowing in the first few episodes indicates that his work was made by reverse calculation of a precise, total construction. The flavor of the episodes of the first half is consistently the same. (Some comical episodes after the 8th episode are considered within this consistency). This story revived the genre of animation and at the same time, clarified the limits of the literary imagination...

>
> According to Anno himself, this change of attitude came about while creating and producing the work. "Evangelion" was received enthusiastically among anime fans. He said that in noticing that autistic, enthusiast reception, he thought he should changed the entire conceptual structure of the work, and in the end that's what he did. After all of the episodes were broadcast, in what looks like a self-tormenting, auto-destructive critique of anime fans that ANNO would repeat many times in radio interviews, specialty anime magazines, etc., he would clearly reiterate the personal intellectual history of MIYAZAKI and OSHII. All three of them isolated themselve from "anime-like things" owing to their hate of the autism after they achieved overwhelming success among anime fans. But ANNO is completely different from them on two critical points. The first difference occurs in "Evangelion" with its simulataneous deep absorption in the anime-like and it's distance from it. In Anno's case the change was terribly compressed. In MIYAZAKI's case, the change occurred between the time of the success of "Lupin the Third, The Castle of Caliogstro" (1979) and "Totoro," and in OSHII's case he took about ten years between the time of the television version of "Urusei Yatsura" and "Mobile Police, Patlabor 2."
>
> In the second difference, as perhaps an inevitable result of that temporal compression, in ANNO the successful critique of anime was brought about by the logic of acceleration and multiplication, while in the case of MIYAZAKI and OSHII the critique of anime succeeded because of the logic of removal. The last half of "Evangelion" takes the form of a critique of previous anime works through developing all the narrative possibilities and anime-like expressions and pushing them to their limits; in other words producing a totality of the anime-like. Simply put, in the second half of "Evangelion" ANNO produces a super-complicated and super-high speed anime and thereby achieved a qualitative change. Several compositions were made for the purposes of constructing a 90's savior narrative were rapidly inverted and were instead employed to tear to shreds the interactive communication among the characters. This means that for ANNO, he deliberately cut off communication with anime fans who supposedly can only appreciate works by identifying themselves with and investing their emotions into the characters....
>
> There are no compromises in ANNO's second half. By employing difficult lines and the omission of mise-en-scene , quick scene shifts, and busy cuts with few frames (in animation this is extremely luxurious because it requires a new illustration for speeds less than one frame-per-second) he manages to condense the narrative which would usually have required several episodes into one. For example, Rei dies in the time of just two minutes. We are overwhelmed by its speed. On the other hand simultaneously Anno will one after another invert riddles in the second part of the story that had been solved in the first half. Therefore, if we only watch an episode only one time, the plot will be almost impossible to follow. (In other words this means that ANNO completely disregarded the age of the viewers who would have been expected to be watching at that broadcast time following the rules of the televisual medium. ) Nevertheless, in the last half of "Evangelion" in a dimension completely separate from that of the narrative logic, he was fairly successful at communicating the feeling of anxiety and the misery of the characters who are one after another wounded to the point of death. How did he accomplish that?
>
> The last half of "Evangelion" gradually loses the co-ordination with the complicated foreshadowing that was installed in the first half and loses the science-fictional, simulational reasonableness of the compostion of the fictional world. (Which is natural given by the change of direction) However, it doesn't mean that the structure became careless. Instead a density and strange necessity arises. For example in episode #22 there is the unfolding of an incomprehensible story as Eva brings down the angel on a satellite orbit only by the throw of a special spear. A rational explanation is not even provided inside the story. But certainly the unfolding of the story possesses a certain inevitability with the flow of the scenes. That "inevitablity" which exists especially independent from the narrative strategy is the true worth of the last half of "Evangelion." That inevitability allows for the dissemination of despair and tension....
>
> To put it boldly, from episode 17 until episode 24 (but especially in episode 18, 19, 22, and 23) at the moment when that condensed unfolding reaches its highest point, he several times makes me thing of GODARD. That is not an explanation related to the quality of cinema itself. That doesn't mean that ANNO tried to cite or parody GODARD. Anybody can borrow stereotypical "Godard-like" images. (Of course ANNO himself does it. For instance using lots of subtitles)"

[_End of Evangelion_](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:End_of_Evangelion_Screenplays) translations

> As a matter of fact, Anno is a student of Leni Riefenstahl, and parodied her Triumph of the Will in the Nadia omake. In the spring 1997 issue of Tokion he said regarding the dangerous potential of art: "Nazi Germany was a perfect example. Those guys were making great movies! Even the anti-Nazi propaganda films Disney produced, portrayed Nazis as being fashionable" (He also said of Evangelion in that same interview, "I'm obviously not from a Christian upbringing, so they will have to excuse me for borrowing certain Christian words and images." He didn't say, "They will have to ignore my borrowing them, because they have no meaning whatsoever within the story").

  --<http://lists.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2009-December/005598.html>

> In 1997, shortly after the success of Evangelion and somewhere during pre-production of Kare Kano, Anno participated in a popular NHK show called "Welcome Back for an Extracurricular Lesson, Sempai!", where popular personalities revisit the town they grew up in to teach a class at their old primary schools. For anyone who has peeked into the very, very dark current of thought he vented so readily in Evangelion, the thought of this is impossible not to snicker at.
>
...
>
> Before Anno arrives, they are to draw and write what they think he's like, based on their thoughts from watching Eva. Puzzled, they just start coming up with silliness.
>
...
>
> "Why is that robot-thingy called Evangelion?"
>
> "It comes from a Christian word meaning 'Gospel' and it's supposed to bring blessings. It has some Greek roots. I chose the name because it sounds complicated."
>
> "What does Rei like?" Otaku boy asks. "I haven't thought about it," is Anno's curt reply. He's not exactly a verbal person, but he's keenly aware of subtle things that affect how the kids might react to him, so he does things like maintain eye level with them. Anno admits he has a self-esteem problem. "I'm not crazy about myself. I'm often told that those who don't like themselves have high ideals, but I think someone who says that doesn't really understand the pain that's involved," he muses.
>
> "Do you like the anime you make?"
>
> "There's parts I like and parts I don't."
>
> "What parts do you dislike?"
>
> "The parts that I'm in."
>
...
>
> After a quick school lunch (Anno barely eats, and refuses all meat and fish) The kids are brought by bus into town to interview Anno's parents and childhood friends. [cf. the '96 anime panel]
>
...
>
> After the kids present their (much improved) animations, Anno wraps up by explaining the point of such free-form exercises. "In school tests, there's only one answer for each question, and you might get zero or half points if you're wrong. But in the real world, things aren't so black and white, so think about things on your own and express them in words or pictures. That's how you communicate with people. That's so important."
>
...
>
> The power lines, the landscapes of man-made structures -- including many of Anno's visual trademark shots -- are so obviously influenced by these surroundings that we almost expect to see Asuka rounding the corner.

> "There's also both Genesis 0:0 features (0:0 - IN THE BEGINNING and 0:0' - THE LIGHT FROM THE DARKNESS) which are recap and making of pieces, neither very interesting although the first has very brief interviews with Sadamoto Yoshiyuki and Anno Hideaki. There's also a series of brief questions asked of the voices of the three main female characters, Mitsuishi Kotono (Misato), Miyamura Yuko (Asuka), and Hayashibara Megumi (Rei). Also included is a separate collection of short TV spots for the End of Evangelion movie I'd never seen before which were QUITE interesting, I'll put it that way."

> So here are 2 bits of an interview with Anno from the french magazine
>
> "Animeland" (#32):
>
> AL: Did you get any complaints for using christian concepts ? Angels are supposed to be good, that seems not to be the case in Evangelion.
>
> Anno: I don't know much about the christian religion, and it wasn't my intention to approach it or to criticize whatsoever. Having said that, wasn't Lucifer an angel himself before his fall?
>
> [...]
>
> AL: There seems to be a recurrent message in your series: That no one can live alone, or apart from a group or an ethnic entity [?]. Why such a message to the otaku, although they live in a world relatively apart?
>
> Anno: One can find whatever message he wants to find in any film or series. I didn't want to tell this or that message in particular, but the fact that you think about it like that is already positive. I did Evangelion to please myself and to please the fans of animation, trying to bring together the largest audience possible.

> Interview with Anno in French magazine:
> "According to Studio Gainax's press release, when humans fall in love or feel close to their family, the part of the brain labeled A-10 comes into play. Strangely, the pilots of EVAs have to use this part of their brains to "merge" with their EVA. That makes them warriors of LOVE, with the power of LOVE to protect their loved ones."

> "...in an interview, director Anno indicated that Misato's character design is modelled after Tsukino Usagi.  The hair style (sans odago), especially the front, is almost an eact duplication of Usagi.  He has even used the words "Misato is Usagi in her 29th years" (I am not quoting the words here, as I forgot the exact wording).

>
> Evangelion was first proposed as a project by Mr. Anno on Sept. 20 1993.
>
> Almost 5 years ago.
>
> The unique look and feel of Tokyo-03 was strongly influenced by the fact that in 1994 GAiNAX relocated their office to the city of Mitaka (3 Eagles) which gave them a new environment to visualized the the world of Evangelion. "Eva LD Movie Box Set"

>> I've gotten curious enough to ask.  Precisely what is Rei doing in that tank in central dogma?  (I think it's episode 15 or in that neighborhood).
>
> Making backups of Rei's memory. A member of GAINAX said that in an interview.

> This was from Shonen A's Sadamoto Yoshiyuki interview:
>
>> "...there were a lot of holes in the plot. For example, I asked (Hideaki Anno) why only children pilot EVAs. His immediate response was 'Right, I must get this sorted out.', then he got all worked up."

   --[Leonard Tai](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-May/014883.html); TODO was this really from 1997? Maybe there was an interview in 1998 *before* Tai wrote in May 1998 and I am unduly pessimistic about how old his information is?

### RCB

> -- So, "Neon Genesis Evangelion" is finally complete.
>
> Why did you decide to conclude the series in the form of a movie?
>
> KT - Yes, it's finally over.  I honestly think it would have been best simply to end it with the TV series.  Frankly speaking, I feel that everything after that was a bit of unnecessary work, although I guess normally one should feel happy about having their work made into a movie.
>
> -- Episode 16 made quite an impression, and seemed to mark a turning point for Evangelion.
>
> KT - That's because it was the first episode where the direction of drawing from the inside like that appeared.
>
> [Note:  Episode 16 "Shi ni itaru yamai, soshite (A Fatal Disease, and then...). Part A consisted of action scenes concerning the 12th Angel, while Part B depicted Shinji's mental and emotional struggles inside his inner universe after being trapped inside the Angel.  Mr. Tsurumaki handled the story boards, production and setting assistance for this episode.]
>
> -- There was a line in that dialogue -- something like, "We can't weave our lives only out of things we like...."  That line was pretty intense.  I would have thought it would strike right to the heart of anime fans, but there was almost no reaction from anyone.  (laugh)
>
> KT - Well, most people don't pay close attention to the dialog when watching a TV anime.  That is to say, we hear the words, but they don't enter our minds. I'm that way too.  Hideaki Anno understands this, and started to incorporate expressions that convey the message to the viewers in a more direct manner. Thus, elements which attempted to somehow convey the message within the bounds of the story gradually became fewer, and expressions which were more introspective or emotionally expressive became more frequent.
>
> -- I see.  Then, it's true that Shinji's feelings are Director Anno's feelings?
>
> KT - To tell the truth I'm not sure, but at the very least I tried to work on the project from that viewpoint.  That's why in the scenario planning sessions I was always saying something like, "Isn't that a little too hero-like for Shinji to say?  Hideaki Anno isn't that much of a hero."
>
> -- In episode 25' Shinji becomes completely despondent.
>
> Does this mean that Director Anno had also experienced that?
>
> KT - I think Hideaki Anno's tension after the TV series had ended had probably fallen to about that level.
>
> -- Looking at the flow of Shinji's emotions, I feel some dissonance when watching movie episode 25' immediately after seeing episode 24.
>
> KT - That may be true in terms of emotional flow.  This is because from the viewpoint of the people making the movie, work on episode 25' started almost a year after episode 24.  TV episode 25 is much more emotionally linked to episode 24.
>
> -- Was this cinema edition made to match Director Anno's state of mind?
>
> KT - I believe so.  There was a time when Hideaki Anno clearly wanted to attempt a more cathartic development.
>
> It didn't end up that way, but I don't think we lied.
>
> -- When you say "lie", do you mean to suddenly conclude with something like "love saved the world"?
>
> KT - Exactly.  And we didn't do that with this movie.  I feel no dissatisfaction at the ending.  I really like it.
>
> -- In the end, Evangelion was a story about communication -- at least judging from that last scene.
>
> KT - That was the intent from the start of the TV series.  That was what I tried to produce from episode 2 onward.
>
> -- Yes, that was the scene where Misato and Shinji talk while measuring distances from each other in Misato's apartment, right?  Although they appeared to be getting along fine with each other, Shinji was thinking, "She seems okay, but....", while Misato was thinking "I wonder if he sees through me?"
>
> KT - there were other scenes in episode 2 as well.  For instance, when Misato talks to Shinji but doesn't enter his room.  Even in episode 3, they are having a casual morning conversation, but are not looking at each other.  Like they looking through a slightly opened door, but not connecting.  This is the same between Shinji and Rei, and between Shinji and his father.  It's no wonder there was a lot of distant, awkward communication.
>
> -- Now even businessmen are debating the mysteries of "Eva" in bars.  (laugh)
>
> KT - (laugh)  For example, Hideaki Anno says that, "Anime fans are too introverted, and need to get out more."  Further, he should be happy that non-anime fans are watching his work, right?  But when all is said and done, Hideaki Anno's comments on "Evangelion" + "Evangelion" are that it is a message aimed at anime fans including himself, and of course, me too.  In other words, it's useless for non-anime fans to watch it.  If a person who can already live and communicate normally watches it, they won't learn anything.
>
> -- But, don't all the people watching "Evangelion" now actually have this type of anime-fan complex?  Doesn't everyone share some feelings of uneasiness at not being able to get along with the world.
>
> KT - Yes, maybe that's so.  Hideaki Anno's statements certainly are true when looking at the small circle of anime fans, but stepping back and looking at the much wider circle of Japanese people in general, we may find many of the same types of problems. They're not problems specific to just anime fans.

> Feeling unsatisfied with this, I looked for a way to accept her death at the hands of Ikari. This made the interpretation of "Liar" very important. But the voice-over grew nearer and nearer....
>
> Director Anno must have noticed how I felt. When it came time to do the voice-over, he showed me a single, hidden hint at the last moment. With that one incredible hint, I, and Ritsuko Akagi, were utterly defeated. It hardly needs saying, but Director Anno is incredible.

> The Red Cross Book defines the Angels as:

> > Beings originated from the source of life called Lilith. They take various sizes and shapes: from a giant octahedron to a minute Angel the size of bacteria, or even a "shadow" Angel without tangible form.  Borrowing Fuyutsuki's words in episode 26', it seems that Angels are beings which got the "Fruit of Life" whereas humanity got the "Fruit of Wisdom".

Gainax [initially proposed](http://www.ex.org/2.4/11-news.HTML) EVANGELION: REBIRTH 2 as the title:

> The End of Evangelion Movie Poster The poster reads: "Wouldn't it be nice if everyone would just die?" (Image © 1997 Gainax/Eva Production Committee)
>
> THE END OF EVANGELION is nigh on 19 July
>
> Toei announced 19 July as scheduled premiere date for the eclectic SF drama NEON GENESIS EVANGELION's theatrical finale, THE END OF EVANGELION (Japanese title: "SHIN SEIKI EVANGELION GEKIJOUBAN: Air/MAGOKORO O, KIMI NI." Gainax initially proposed EVANGELION: REBIRTH 2 as the title). This planned 70-minute feature will begin with the incomplete 27-minute Rebirth portion from March's NEON GENESIS EVANGELION: DEATH AND REBIRTH (SHIN SEIKI EVANGELION GEKIJOUBAN: SHI TO SHINSEI) film and finish with new animation.

> The tentative title for episode 26, in the first drafts of the overall story, was "Tatta Hitotsu no, Saeta Yarikata". "Tatta Hitotsu no Saeta Yarikata" is the Japanese title of "the Only Neat Thing to Do" by James Tiptree Jr.

  --<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/2001-March/039361.html>

> 'Alice Sheldon, writing as James Tiptree Jr., wrote a clear lineal descendant of "The Cold Equations," called "The Only Neat Thing to Do", (not available online) in 1985. The 1950s had made way for the 1980s and in this story the young female protagonist makes the decision for herself. The situation is somewhat different; she is alone in a spaceship with a parasitical alien that could be a danger to her world if she returns, so she does the "only neat thing" by heading outward forever, in effect committing suicide by eventual diminution of resources. As Godwin did, Tiptree stacked the deck to make only one neat thing available to her protagonist.'

> The song Komm Susser Todd (German for "Come Sweet Death") used for the film, The End of Evangelion: Episode 26' - Sincerely Yours, is an English translation of Director Hideaki Anno's original Japanese lyrics.

  --<http://www.evaotaku.com/omake/Komm.html>

> From the beginning, everyone has been saying that the "Death" part of "Death and Rebirth" is a "perfect collection" of the TV series, but it wasn't an easy-to-understand digest edition, as in "Space Battleship Yamato" and "Mobile Soldier Gundam."
>
> Ignoring the timeline of the TV series, the psychological condition of the main characters is shown.... Shocking and exciting scenes are put together as if just randomly shuffled, and nowhere do we see the introduction, development, turn, and conclusion [as in a well-composed Chinese poem]. This is a somewhat unkind thing to do to people who have never seen the TV series. "Death and Rebirth" could be labeled "No first-time customers" because of this.
>
> [Note: "No first-time customers" is a sign on some very conservative restaurants in Japan that only take regular customers and people introduced by regulars.]
>
> The completely new section "Rebirth", is a 24 part continuation -- a story that replaces the final two episodes which gave rise to all sorts of public criticism.
>
...
>
> An animated TV series (with 26 episodes) broadcast on TV Tokyo Channel from October '95 to March '96. The ratings were only 7.1%, but bit by bit from the second half on it moved up to a central place by word of mouth, and after the broadcasts ended it extended into even more of a boom. The movie is a continuation of the TV series.
>
...
>
> This story is told primarily from the point of view of Shinji Ikari, who was suddenly called to become an Eva pilot against his will by his father, Gendou Ikari, who is the commander of Nerve. Shinji is convinced that he was abandoned by his father when he was very young, and he is extremely frightened by contact with strangers. Also, everyone around him at Nerve likewise carries a wound in their heart and a sickness in their soul.
>
...
>
> The final two episodes of the TV series were 25 and 26. The story suddenly totally abandons what had been foreshadowed up to that point, its SF-style development, etc., and ends by depicting only the inner world of the protagonist, Shinji Ikari. Shinji gets a psychological breakthrough, and the curtain closes with the other characters saying "Congratulations" to him. It also includes things like rough, graffiti-like art, and forms of expression so far from normal you can't even call it "experimental"; this kind of ending, with fans instantly spouting out arguments pro and con, became one reason for the increasingly widespread popularity of Eva.
>
> A 30-billion yen anime?
>
> At any rate, related software was selling and selling. The video LD has totaled over 2.5 million in sets of 10 disks, the sound-track edition (album) has sold over one million in sets of three, the three-volume collected comics and the nine-volume film books have totaled 7.7 million copies, and 1.23 million people have gone to see the movie "Neon Genesis Evangelion Movie: Death and Rebirth" from when it was released in March.
>
> Besides this, if we add in the plastic models and related goods, it easily breaks through the 30 billion yen mark. Furthermore, the TV series video LDs are not yet all sold and the movie edition packages are not yet on sale. Who can say how long the sales will continue?
>
...
>
> Someone connected to the consumer electronics industry said they are hoping "it will become a trigger for the spread of DVD," and so on July 19th volume 1 of the Eva videos will be offered for sale. In the first period of five volumes, episodes 1-20 of the TV series will be recorded four to a volume, and they will be released one per month.
>
...
>
> If it really becomes a "trigger," this will be one more thing to increase the legend of Eva.
>
...
>
> As with Megumi Hayashibara of "Ranma 1/2," and Kotono Mitsuishi and Aya Hisakawa of "Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon" before, a group of new, nearly "untouched" voice actors have grown along with their production and have been enjoying immense popularity.
>
> Among the ranks of the "Eva" players, one could say that Yuko Miyamura matches this pattern. As almost the only "new person", she has made her break in the role of Asuka Langley Souryuu in a difficult lone battle. It could well be said that her energy had no small part in bringing about Eva's popularity.
>
...
>
> Miyamura: I'm still really new to television series and there were always more experienced actors around me. Especially in Eva with its adult drama, I have learned a lot from the acting and many talents of the experienced actors.
>
> Also, because Asuka was completely finished by losing her mind in the TV series, I also got into a similar mental state; the stress built up and I suffered from bulimia for a while.

>
>
>
>         You already know the beginning of this one (a beach, petrified headless Evas, etc).
>
>         Thew, we see the graves Shinji made (it's stated by Anno it was _he_ who made them). The names of all main Eva characters are written on them, except for "Ayanami Rei".
>
>         We then see Asuka's grave.
>
>         And Asuka's foot kicking it to the ground. ^^;
>
>         (you can still see these graves in the actual ending... no names, but there is Misato's pendant nailed on one of them, and an other has been kicked down ^^ )
>
>         We then see Shinji and Asuka on the beach... and you know that scene, too (but this draft demonstrates that Shinji and Asuka didn't just wake up there after Third Impact... they've been living here for some times... meaning they _could_ be the two only humans willing to return, after all... ^^; )
>
>         When Shinji starts crying, Asuka was supposed to say something like "Idiot. No way I'll let you kill me" ("idiot" was removed in the storyboards... and the whole line was modified, eventually).
>
>
>
>         Then, the ending music (so, there was one... ^^ ) was supposed to begin, and the staff credits were to appear (Anno suggests a horizontal scrolling, like in GunBuster, I guess).
>
>         We were to see Eva-01 lying on the Moon, and woman's hair showing from its broken mask (but her face remains unseen).
>
>         Behind Eva-01, you could see Earth, entirely red.
>
>         And the Black Moon, destroyed.
>
>         The camera goes to the sun, then to the stars.
>
>         Credits end.
>
>         "Shûgeki" ("the end").
>
>
>
> Now the true ending is based upon Last A. Last B is slightly different.
>
>
>
>         Last B
>
>
>
>         It begins like the previous one, but Asuka doesn't show up in the "graves scene".
>
>         We then see Shinji lying on the beach.
>
>         His right hand is holding a white one.
>
>         "I'll never see them again."
>
>         "It's better to think of it this way."
>
>         "I'm still alive, so I'll keep on living."
>
>         He squeezes the hand harder.
>
>         Then, he sees Rei (like in the actual episode and Last A).
>
>         We eventually see that there is nobody lying near Shinji. Just a white arm without the rest of the body.
>
>         The camera then shows the full moon.
>
>         The ending credits are the same as in Last A.

The video is done in the  documentary way, with thick particles and slightly blurred focus. The names of all the production staff appears continously throughout the CM, with one name lasting only for 0.1s (my guess) and you can't even read the names at all.

> The cult anime named Evangelion. A forbidden anime about how a group led by morally/spiritually bankrupt individuals uses an autistic boy to wage pitched battles against incomprehensible creatures, and how through contact with the hearts of a mentally fragile, bandaged girl and an overly self-conscious, traumatized girl, that boy ultimately attains deliverance/salvation himself in the final episode. Some viewers became enraged, some despondent, some lost friends as a result of hysterical disputes, and some attained deliverance/salvation themselves.

> If memory serves correctly, when the plan arose they made up to Ep6 (despite Anno apparently saying in Quick Japan magazine that they had "made up to Ep7 in advance") and sent out feelers in all directions, but were given the cold shoulder by every company. (laugh) Even Bandai snubbed them based on the past results of the huge failure of "Wings of Honneamise (Royal Space Force)". (laugh) They had connections with a TV Tokyo producer, but if you can't get sponsors it doesn't matter. So after wandering lost by the wayside for a bit, Kadokawa Shoten finally picked them up. But the truth is that even Kadokawa just barely picked them up, and flatly rejected their budget requests, saying that they only intended to budget the same level and not a yen more than other anime Kadokawa had sponsored in the past (Tenchi Muyo, etc.).
>
...
>
> Anno himself also replied in an interview that, "We completely ran out of time partway through...." However, the direct cause was not the PTA or a lack of time, but the more pressing issue of "budget".
>
...
>
> ...finally moving his heavy arse, Anno vastly restructured the production system. First, 75% or more of the production staff from Ep16 onward were outsourced South Korean staff. In terms of the animation as well, when reusing sequences other than bank sequences or for still shots, instead of using the film, these sequences were instead dubbed in at the end using a video deck. This is why character close-ups and other shots that seemed to jiggle increased partway through the series. They even mixed stupid photographs and other stuff into the mental image scenes. In the worst cases some scenes just showed a still screen that lasted for a minute or more. But no matter how much they struggled, they had already exceeded their budget and time limits. And then to top it all off were those last two episodes.
>
> Although budget issues were the main problem, Gainax had also quarreled constantly with TV Tokyo since before the TV airing over moral issues such as how the show would end and other details. These ranged from trivial points such as it being improper to show women's underwear in the hanging laundry, to major items such as the brutal scene at the end of Ep18 "The Choice of Life". It's kind of letting the cat out of the bag now, but the truth is that "Asuka dies from madness (she lives in the TV version)," "Shinji dissolves but reforms," and "Rei also dies" were already determined before the TV airing started, and Gainax had quarreled a number of times with the TV Tokyo producer and related parties over these plot devices. Furthermore, the ending was supposed to have been "The main characters die one after another, and the final battle is Ikari Shinji vs. Ikari Gendo," although there probably isn't any evidence left to support that now. (laugh) Well, except it seems that Hayashibara Megumi (voice actress for Ayanami Rei) said on a radio program something like: "I might end up fighting against Shinji." I also heard talk that "Misato and Ritsuko both die fighting each other, and Misato's death awakens Shinji(?)" Surprisingly, it seems the character who was the key to the climax was not Rei, but Misato. But then I guess it doesn't matter what is said now. (laugh)
>
...
>
> When Ep20 aired, complaints poured in from the PTA. This infuriated TV Tokyo all the way up to the upper management, which made it impossible for Gainax to take any bold measures. Nowadays it's pretty much taken for granted that the only people who complain over every little thing in children's TV anime or manga are people like Kofuku-no-Kagaku* pulling a publicity stunt for their "evil book banning movement".... Still, at that point the TV Tokyo upper management issued the severe notice that "Any anime that is deluged with complaints from the PTA even once from now on will be canceled regardless of the reason." The anime "Bakuretsu Hunters" and "Fushigi Yugi" were airing on the same channel at the time, and these also caught flak and received strict warnings even though they had not done anything. (laugh) That's why there were so many unnatural changes in the story contents from Ep20 onward.
>
> So for these reasons, the Eva [TV] ending was made under conditions with Gainax's hands tied in terms of budget, time and content. Considering that the last two episodes were made under those conditions, Director Anno might even be viewed as amazing.... Nope, I just can't view him like that. (laugh) After all it was his own damn fault that things turned out that way.
>
...
>
> Anno said in some anime magazine that “Katsuragi Misato is modeled in part on my first love,” but do you know who he was talking about? It’s Hidaka Noriko, the voice actress for Jean in “Nadia and the Secret of Blue Water”. (laugh) When the TV version of “Nadia” launched, Anno confessed his feelings to Hidaka Noriko. This is a famous story in the industry. Apparently Anno told her that he “looked at her not as an object of adoration/longing, but as a serious love interest!” (ROTFL!) Apparently he was even seriously thinking of marriage.However, Hidaka Noriko refused him flatly, saying “I have no intention of marrying someone in the anime industry.” Wait, what? Don’t we know now that she was married to some anime-related producer at the time? (ROTFL!) But Anno would not give up, and told her, “Well, watch my next work, and then decide!” In other words Anno was proposing an affair to the already married Hidaka Noriko. (laugh) Anyway, Anno next work was “Evangelion”, so... Evangelion might be considered a work that embodies something of a stalker obsession.
>
...
>
> But it looks like there is no shortage of people willing to get paid and become famous for writing magazine articles on the subject. Isn't that right? Okada-san? Takekuma-san? Otsuki Kenji-san? (ROTFL!)

<http://lists.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1997-October/006527.html>

> Anno, as late as the November '96 issue of Newtype magazine, still denied that the last two episodes were a "lousy job" and argued that the Gainax crew worked incredibly hard to finish the series, which he thinks "ended beautifully." He regretted that fans cannot appreciate Gainax's efforts.
>
> Asked about the violence and uncharacteristic sex scene in episodes 18 and 19, Anno said that the scenes were necessary to develop the story and "to understand real life." He felt that children should be exposed early to the realities of life so that they do not grow up weak and sheltered and so that they will become immune to some of the harsh situations they will eventually experience. Many fans at the convention thought that this was an interesting viewpoint on his part.
>
> Do you wonder why Eva got so dark and psychological near the end? After all, Anno is the guy who directed Nadia of the Mysterious Seas, one of the liveliest and funniest anime I've ever watched. According to Anno, from episode 16 on, he began reading books about human psychology and became very interested. He wanted to explore "what the human mind is all about inside."
>
> "I wrote about myself. My friend lent me a book on psychological illness and this gave me a shock, as if I finally found what I needed to say," he says in the November Newtype.

> Much of the premise and many of the early elements of EVA are familiar, indeed stereotyped elements of Japanese TV science fiction: teenage boy is chosen to pilot a robot his father built and fight against the enemy. It's reminiscent of anime from GIGANTOR to GIANT ROBO ( on which Anno was special - effects director ) , and the weird organic forms of the enemy, who attack one at a time, are reminiscent of the " monster of the week " tokusatsu shows such as ULTRAMAN ( Anno's favorite television show ) . The director of EVANGELION began from an immediately familiar and recognizable template, but in an interview before the show first aired, put the question up front: " If a person likes robot or cute girl animation, can they still be happy with it after the age of twenty? " It may seem like an odd question for Anno, 36 year - old super - otaku, who created in EVA an anime full of robots and cute girls, to pose.
>
> But the director was quite serious: his studio, Gainax is known as the otaku who examine themselves. The personal, allegorical nature of their work was treated seriously in HONNEAMISE and humorously in OTAKU NO VIDEO, and it emerges throughout the length of EVANGELION, many of whose multi - generational cast of characters are painted masks for the show's staff and most especially for Hideaki Anno himself.

I personally am glad that, rather than Christianity, he didn't express some obscure Buddhist theme, because then it would have been linked more with Aum Shinri Kyo. [LAUGHS]

[LAUGHS] As far as David Lynch is concerned, I don’t dislike David Lynch, but on the other hand, he’s not someone I’m a huge fan of, either. As far as Anno, there have been people who have called Evangelion the anime equivalent of Twin Peaks. [LAUGHS]

> Asahi Newspaper publishes a weekly magazine "AERA." AERA 08/31/1998 issue dealt with an interview with Hideaki Anno.
>
> As you know, he is 180 cm tall. He is a kind of giant for normal Japanese.
>
> He always fears something. But he himself is a kind of fear.
>
> He was born in 1960 in Ube city, Yamaguchi Prefecture. In his childhood, Ube city has shipyards. His inside proto-landscape is like such a shipyard, say, NERV base. (Faculty of Medicine, Yamaguchi University is located at Ube city.)
>
> His father Takuya Anno lost his left leg like Touji Suzuhara.
>
> Hideaki Anno fears animal. Therefore he is a vegetarian.
>
> He said, "I cannot break my own heart shell. However I think I can enlarge it because I completed EVA."
>
> He is shy in fact.
>
> He made EVA as his private anime. After EVA, he escaped from work. He tried to kill himself. In order not to kill himself, he had to live at the building of GAiNAX, Musashino-city, Tokyo.
>
> But he lost his everything because he wasted out his all inside to make EVA.

The only known footage of him is _Hideaki Anno Talks to Kids_, and the video doesn't show very much: he sits normally, and is standing normally, and his bow doesn't seem odd - but those are undemanding actions which wouldn't be odd with a good prosthetic.)

> [Anno] The reason the game business prospered and grew so fast is because it was a venture.  But games have finally tanked too.  It happened pretty fast, didn't it?  Our generation is naturally a shallow one, and there's no-one who's trying to overturn things.  There isn't anyone trying to make "me-anime" now, is there?
>
...
>
> [Anno] The first time I saw "Virtua Fighter"[2], I thought, is _this_ what anime is up against?  It was quite a shock.  That's when I realized I'd have to level up somewhere other than the visuals, I guess right before I did "EVA". Visual impact is anime's strong point, but since games had followed on anime's heels, it had become a time when a methodology no different from the others just wouldn't cut it.  All the cards had already been dealt, so we had no choice but to change the combination, or turn over cards that were thought to be taboo. That's what I mean when I say that "EVA" didn't use even a single new methodology.
>
> [Ikuhara] Ah, like what the media talks about as creatorhood when discussing animated works.  But that's just an illusion, and actually in the anime business no such thing as a creator is anywhere to be found.  All there are are people who were brought along by the founding of the system.  The people who devise the form of the anime of today.
>
...
>
> [Ikuhara] There's somewhere where we'll give up, isn't there.  We're trying to fulfill our own ambitions virtually.  I suppose if we were doing it for real we should be trying to make more properly ideal cities and better human relations. I can't really say it in anything but pedestrian terms, but, like with things like the Aum[*1] incident, I can understand the feelings of the people who want to reorganize the world. [Anno] In order to see a made-up drama, there are even people who neglect their real lives, right?  That kind of person does things like become a seiyuu fan.
>
> [Ikuhara] I bet what they really wanted was to touch an anime character.
>
> [Anno] For something that could connect the virtual and the real, I too turned to the seiyuu.  But that was a mistake.  That's why I tried to show something different in "KareKano".  But altering the existing system is tough.
>
...
>
> [Anno] Yes, a world where something is done with the body alone.  Nothing else befits a documentary.  A world that shows nothing of creation.
>
> [Ikuhara] Take "Utena" and "EVA".  They take a fragment of our work and talk about us introducing impact into our animation, saying it's like Terayama Shushi[12]'s work or something.  It's nothing that narrow, is it?  I think that what appears in our works is the complex about the body that people who make made-up anime feel.
>
> [Anno] I use the word "lifelike-ness".  Compared to that, cel anime is pretty and virtual.  Because I feel a sense of thwarted life in current cel anime, I want to try to peek at it from a slightly different direction.  Like trying not to use any of the established seiyuu.

It contained a special feature transcribing some of Hiroyuki Yamaga's answers to audience questions at Fanime Con '98 after a screening of Evangelion: Death (True) and Evangelion (Rebirth). I believe Mr. Yamaga's panel was also covered in Protoculture Addicts, but they may have included some remarks and not others (and the reverse is likely true for my piece)."

Whether they can go beyond that point depends on the given individual. Going beyond that point requires quality. Hard work alone won't do it. And there will always be someone better than you. If you get carried away by how good you are, what do you suppose will happen when you discover that there are far better people in the world already?

> Hirata: I don't like America either. Right now, Japan's economy is bad. But when it was really good, America said that it was doing too well, and now that it's bad, they won't help us out. They just say that it's our own fault. Makes me think, who do they think they are, anyway?
>
> All: (laughter)

...
>
> Anno: Asia is where it's at now. We'd best get in good with our neighbors. The previous generation is with America. Those currently in their 50's typically think in terms of America. In reaction to losing the War to America, they all want to live the American lifestyle. Like all going to Europe, that sort of thing.
>
> Takahashi: I get that feeling when I read theses written by people of that time.
>
> Anno: It's like an America-first philosophy. In my generation, though, you turn more and more to domestic matters, look more inward. When I was in the boondocks of Yamaguchi, Tokyo as I saw it on TV looked so incredible, so I always wanted to go there. I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend college, that sort of thing.

> Anno: Put it on TV, though, and old ladies with time on their hands watch it. We got one such old lady calling the TV station while "Evangelion" was on the air, saying that we shouldn't have sexy scenes.
>
> Miyabu: Just for that?
>
> Anno: Yep. There's no sense of realism about high school students having a romance without sex, is there. I'm thinking about putting a message at the beginning of each episode telling grade-school students not to watch.
>
> Miyabu: Are the main characters of "Kareshi Kanojo no Jijoo" going to be junior-high or high school students?
>
> Anno: They're in their first year of high school, and in the manga they've recently had sex. And it just happened, without any buildup. I'm trying to figure out how to make something dramatic out of this. Could that be the way it is? Do they just do it?
>
> Miyabu: What do you think?
>
> Anno: I think I'm stuck. The male lead seemed to me to be so terribly upstanding, I figured he'd treat her better than that, when he up and has sex with her. He's not the character I thought he was. Maybe that's what it's like nowadays. People don't waste time, or something.
>
...
>
> Anno: Everyone defines pure love differently. But old biddies like the one who complained (about Eva) have never experienced it. They do things like that to kill time, because they're dissatisfied with kids today. They're not dissatisfied with themselves, but with their environment, their surroundings. They ignore any blame they may have for their situations, instead blaming everything on anime. I never thought I'd get caught up in it. Nobody sounds as loud as old biddies like those. They have so much time on their hands that instead of calling telephone dating clubs, they call TV stations.

>
> Anno: I didn't have any girlfriends in high school. I did manga and astronomy, as well as watch anime and play mah jongg. When there was a test, I'd tell my folks I was going to a friend's house to study. We'd play all-night mah jongg, then we'd catch a nap before eventually going to school, and when the test was over we'd go back and play mah jongg some more. It was all anime and mah jongg. Back then, girls avoided me like the plague, because I was so gloomy.
>
...
>
> Anno: In junior high, I had a little fling that seemed like love, but wasn't. It turned into a triangle with a pal of mine, and that turned into a crisis. All through high school, I decided that being the way I was, was fine, and had no romances the whole time. Some underclasswomen came on to me, but I showed them no interest. The world was full of things more interesting than women. I was much more interested in making movies back then than dating. I regret it now, though. My life might be different now if I'd had sex back then.
>
...
>
> Anno: I don't recommend technical schools. Everyone who goes to one of those places starts off by having the same field of specialty, after all, so monotony soon sets in. Take anime schools for example. You go to one of those, and you've got a gathering of people who've all been social and class outcasts up to now. You'll start suffering the illusion that the world revolves around you as a result. I haven't yet seen anyone who liked anime and who'd ever gotten any use out of what he learned in those places.

> Anno: I hate school, you know? And the thing I hate about it is no different from 20 years ago. Teachers also ought to have hated school, seeing as how they were about the same age as me. So they should have hated it too, you know? Why did becoming teachers change them into teachers?
>
> All: Sad but true.
>
> Anno: And it's scary to think that they had to have been students too. The world changes people. Parents too: they had to have been kids themselves once, and yet as parents they're so different.

> Noguchi: When it comes to law, you've got privacy safeguards, for example, but there are also things that need to be made public, and in cases where a choice has to be made, it ends up in a courtroom, with the decision being left up to the judge to make.
>
> Anno: Laws in the light of a trial are unreasonable things. School is acclimatizing you to that, so you won't complain about it.
>
> Ichikawa: We're being trained, like pets.

> Anno: I was basically the honor-student type up until junior high. I was always on student council, that sort of thing. I got into the best feeder schools in my area, up to high school. I swore that I wouldn't do any more studying once I passed my exams. I didn't like to study, so I studied only the areas and sentences that interested me, and that as little as possible. What good is algebra going to do me in real life, after all?
>
...
>
> Anno: When I got a zero, the school not annoyed because they were supposed to be a feeder school. So I made sure not to get negative marks. When I got to high school, all I did was play mah jongg and make 8mm movies. I spent all my high school years just goofing off. So naturally there were no universities I could get into, and at the time, Osaka College of Art had no entrance exams. Rather, I got in on my accomplishments. But I stopped going in my third year, and ended up getting expelled.
>
...
>
> Anno: What it boils down to is, society only sees the numbers. When it comes to movies too, there's a need to apply either of two labels, either that it was interesting or that it wasn't. School grades are the same way, because Japan only has one evaluation method, that of negative test scoring. I think cumulative test scoring would be more interesting, personally. In the final analysis, the system is about how can you avoid making mistakes. The top score is set at 100 points. It's a game, and the object is to figure out how to minimize your mistakes and keep teachers from reducing your points. I'd say that the problem lies with this negative scoring system, but if asked, I'd also have to say that cumulative scoring wouldn't solve things either.
>
...
>
> Anno: I think it's clear that they're a far cry from when I was in high school. They're smart. I get the feeling that they can see their own lives in an instant, by observing their parents and other grown-ups around them. And I'm enjoying that.
>
> Kawakami: I heard something to the effect that as part of making anime, you meet and talk with lots of different people.
>
> Anno: I think that's more or less what I said. Anime and manga are completely fictional picture worlds, and thus what happens in them is impossible in real life. Now, there are two approaches you can take. You can either make it look like a dream all the way to the end, where you bring it back to reality, or you can show reality all the way to the end, and finish up with a dream. A lot of anime starts out as a dream, and ends as a dream. This is no good, because it feels like you're using dreams as a retreat. And Japan is not such a tough place to live.
>
> I can't help but wonder why people are withdrawing into dreams in a reasonably prosperous country. A lot of these people in particular are anime fans, and for a while I couldn't deal with that. I got fed up with Evangelion too, for that reason. I can't stand people who run away, who refuse to face reality. Surely you'll find something for yourself if you face reality head on. If nothing else, take a good look at your immediate surroundings. Don't turn away from unpleasantness. Have a look at it too. With this in mind, ultimately I want to show a little reality in my works. If nothing else, I don't feel any realism in something that has no reality mixed in with it. Thus, while my next production will be a girl's manga about a high-school girl, it's also partly real.

Even if I should realize it and keel over from exhaustion, that's fine, because my life right now is good. It's great. Right now, I figure I'll keep on going the rest of my life, in just this way.

> Anno: Yeah, I think it's better to believe that tomorrow is always with us, rather than that it can be cleanly cut away. That doesn't mean that you do the same thing tomorrow as today, though. It's important to form an image of tomorrow being even just a little different, say, even as little 3% or 5%, from today. If you believe that you want to be a certain way, chances are you'll move in that direction. Having a clear image is the key.

> "Their best original works--Yamaga's _Royal Space Force_, Takeshi Mori's _Otaku no Video_, Kazuya Tsurumaki's _FLCL_, and Anno's _Evangelion_--display Gainax's odd inside-out paradox of being super-obsessed fans who, through their meditations, nevertheless sometimes come to enlightenment about the nature of themselves, their medium, their industry, their times, and their world."

  --Carl Horn, ["Editor's Note, Manga Volume 1"](http://www.evamonkey.com/writings_horn01.php)

> Azuma Hiroki:  I think that this phenomenon is very new in Japanese cultural scene of the 80's: the multiplication in number does not mean that they socialize and get open. Anno is very conscious about such closeness. In other interviews [mit einschlaegigen Animemagazinen [_Animage_] he says that in the beginning of making _Evangelion_ he wanted to enlarge the number of otaku. It was some kind of master plan for  "otakuzation" in order to break the closedness. But towards the end [of the production process] he had to break that pattern and to diffuse it. This change, that occurred in less than half a year is very important to Japanese culture, because it clearly shows that one typical strategy to implode a closed/specialized cultural terrain necessarily results in failure. The series _Evangelion_ can be divided in 2 parts. The first part is a well made Sci-Fi anime. The characters are described as happy and communicative; typical Sci-Fi anime characters such as Asuka. Rei is of course very exceptional. The first part seems to develop into a happy ending, which is of course the most desirable plot for anime fans. The way they watch these films is a process of identifying with the characters. They want to be Shinji or Asuka. But the later part diverges from such a typical pattern. The reviews and comments of Anime fans published in their respective magazines show their disappointment with the later episodes, since there is no hope for a happy ending and no space for their identification with characters. The mystery of the _Evangelion_ world gets increasingly critical and complicated. This is obviously not a typical Anime plot anymore. Another level is the level of imagery. The speed of cut ups is very high towards the end. When I asked Anno about influences he did not mention Nouvelle Vague, although I expected him to say Godard. He named Okamoto Kihachi, a filmmaker of the Japanese Nouvelle Vague, who was actually influenced by Godard. [_Blue Christmas_ was by Kihachi.]
>
,,,

> [AH:] In episode 19 Evangelion punches the enemy, the black  Evangelion. This scene is very violent and brutal. Such cruel imagery cannot be accepted by Anime fans.
>
> KW: Was there a controversy about this particular scene?

  --<http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9802/msg00101.html> interview with Azuma Hiroku; Azuma is referring to his own interview of Anno [in 1996](#p-4) (that interview is not translated, but [1731298478 confirms](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=410273#410273) what a Google Translate suggests)

> Although Death and Rebirth  has not yet had a commercial release on video or disc in Japan, it recently aired on the Japanese cable channel WOWOW, and this copy was the source for the public screening at Fanime -- a screening believed to be the first in the United States.
>
> Death and Rebirth came out in Japan on March 15, 1997. A month prior to the film's Japanese premiere, Eva director Hideaki Anno called a Valentine's Day press conference to announce that while "it was my intent to conclude (Eva) with (Death and Rebirth)... the story expanded far beyond the vision I had when we began production, and we went vastly over the planned running length and frames of animation."
>
...
>
>  Death is an edited version of the events of episodes #1-24 of the Evangelion TV series, yet it is no mere synopsis; besides containing several new scenes (it opens with secret UN footage from their Antarctic Base shortly before the Second Impact), Death tells the story of Eva in a completely different order that leads the viewer to contemplate director Anno's choice of view and focus. Hiroyuki Yamaga compared Anno's editing method to that of a DJ, "sampling" the episodes in a complex, non-linear mix. In another, literal sense as well, Death is a musical composition -- the movie is structured as a string concerto in four parts, and we return at various points in the edit to the same mysterious locale where much of the events of Eva TV episodes #25 and #26 take place (thus strongly suggesting that despite the presentation of The End of Evangelion -- of which Rebirth is of course the first part -- as a "remake" of those final two episodes, it might be better regarded as another viewpoint on them instead) where various Eva characters perform, separately and together, musical selections from Bach, Beethoven, and Pachelbel.

> 'When the very first meeting was held before the title had even been decided, Anno had already provided the theme of "a battle between gods and humans".  Both Anno and I -- our generation -- was influenced by Go Nagai, so making something on a grand scale meant it ended up like "Devilman". The character design request from Anno was that "the lead character is a girl, and has an older-sister type figure like Coach next to her," so it was structurally similar to "Gunbuster". So I first designed an Asuka-type girl as the lead character, but after "Gunbuster" and "Nadia" I felt some resistance to making the lead character a girl again. I mean a robot should be piloted by a trained person, and if that person just happens to be a girl then that is fine, but I couldn't see why a young girl would pilot a robot... So I remember saying to Anno, "It's a robot story, so let's make the lead character a boy."  And just about that time, I was watching the NHK [public TV channel] program "Brain and Heart" and learned about the existence of the A10 nerve, and I told Anno about the idea that popped into my head at that time. That was the idea where "the dead mother is inside the robot, which is operated by mental/psychical bonding with the child. Moreover, parent-child relations are parched/strained due to the death of the mother at a young age."
>
> ...
>
> An easily recognizable silhouette is also important, but I designed the characters so that their personalities could be more or less understood at a glance.  For example, even the color and length of
the hair expresses personality.  I thought that Asuka would occupy the position of an "idol" in the Eva world, and that [Asuka and] Shinji should be just like the relationship between Nadia and Jean. And then I set Rei as the opposing "Ying" portion.  It was my idea to have her wrapped in bandages.  The most difficult was Misato.  So I thought it would be interesting to have someone like the older girl next door as a military person.
>
> We had talked a lot in the beginning about wanting a title like "Space Runaway Ideon (Legendary Giant God Ideon)", so I think I did push that.  And to tell the truth, the story composition is also similar.  For example, Nerv can be considered the same as the Solo Ship fighting a lonely battle against both humankind and the Buff Clan, and then there are the incomprehensible robots that can only communicate with children and tend to go berserk, etc.  It might not be an exaggeration to say that if you add "Ideon" and "Devilman" together and divide by two, you get "Evangelion". (laugh)'

   --[_Der Monde_ Sadamoto interview](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2006-November/003855.html); partial translation, covering key character design

> From the planning stages, Hideaki Anno, a representative creator of GAINAX, was at the heart of the production work and his individuality colors every aspect of the show. Fascinating characters, a captivating sci-fi premise, dynamic battle scenes, and super-high density of information that incorporates Christianity and psychoanalysis. Each of those elements surpassed the realm of all anime that had come before it and made it a work worthy of the title "New Century (Neon Genesis)."
>
> From back when it was airing on TV, Neon Genesis Evangelion had the ardent support of fans and its popularity boomed even after it finished its run. Its influence was not limited to anime fans but also spread to the general populace, and it was even called the third impact, following Space Battleship Yamato and Mobile Suit Gundam.

> Reunited with Shinji for the first time in 3 years, the executive commander of NERV, Gendo Ikari, orders him to get on the Eva and out into the field on the spot. And faced with Eva Unit-00 and Rei Ayanami, he repeats over and over, "I Mustn't run away," as if he is trying to convince himself of it. "Communicating with others" is a vital theme of Evangelion and depicting how Shinji interacts with those around him is part of the story of Evangelion. The revealing of why Gendo treats Shinji so coldly is left to Episode Twenty-Six, "My True Heart For You," which was released theatrically.
>
> When Shinji comes to New Tokyo-3, he sees a girl that seems to be Rei Ayanami for just an instant. Considering how she is injured and wrapped up in bandages, when he later meets her in NERV Headquarters, the natural assumption would be to think that this was a phantom vision. But in Episode 26, "My True Heart For You," a different possibility is suggested. The girl that appeared for just one cut in this scene may be the Rei Ayanami who is "the existence that gazes upon man."
>
...
>
> Shinji was supposed to live by himself, but instead, Misato takes him in and the two begin their life together in her apartment.  In order to try to close the gap between her and him, Misato acts silly around Shinji and as if in response to that, Shinji acts exaggeratedly surprised by the presence of Pen Pen, the hot spring penguin.  Seeing Shinji's true intentions in his actions, Misato says to herself, "Maybe I'm the one who's transparent."  It is a most Eva-like depiction concerning "communication."  In the preview, the idea of her taking Shinji in is clearly stated as "Misato's arrogance."  The sense with which they coolly capture such events is also part of the appeal of Evangelion.
>
...
>
> Toji, who consciously behaves like a man, and Kensuke, who has his own world of his hobby concerning all things military and who also knows how to get on in the world, are very contrasting characters compared to Shinji. The names of these two characters are taken from the main characters in Ryu Murakami’s The Fascism of Love and Illusions, which provides no small amount of inspiration for Director Anno.
>
...
>
> In this episode, Ritsuko talks about the “hedgehog’s dilemma,” which is a psychology term that originates from Schopenhauer’s fable, and it expresses the complications and ambivalence that arises as people seek the psychological distance to maintain between each other. This is where the English episode title “Hedgehog’s Dilemma” for Episode Four “Rain, Escape, and Afterwards” comes from. In addition, what Misato says in this same scene allows us to see what her thoughts on communicating are at this time, so that is also very interesting.
>
...
>
> Episode Four depicts the wanderings of Shinji, who has run away from Misato and NERV. Shinji and Misato hurt each other with their thorns as they try to get closer, and yet even then, they need one another. The relationship between these two is indeed just like the “hedgehog’s dilemma” that Ritsuko had mentioned in Episode Three. There is no battle with an Angel and it largely stays away from addressing any of the mysteries, but when considered from a thematic perspective, this is truly Eva-like drama.
>
> In actuality, this episode was once omitted in terms of the series composition and it was planned that what is now Episode Five would come after Episode Three. But as production progressed, staff members voiced their opinion that perhaps there was a need to depict Shinji’s relationship with the people around him after Episode Three, and thus, this episode was made, greatly changing the contents from what had originally been conceived. Because of this, the script for this episode written after the script for Episode Five had already been finalized. This is the one and only episode of all the TV and movie episodes in which Director Anno did not have a direct hand in the plot and script.
>
> In terms of performance, the highlight has got to be the final cut at the train station where Shinji and Misato gaze at each other. This cut, which has absolutely no dialogue or movement, lasts roughly 50 seconds. It is a silence that would normally be inconceivably long, but it depicts Shinji’s feelings in finding it difficult to express himself in words.

  --<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol1_episode_commentaries.htm>

> Among the footage shown are included a number of characters and images who appear towards the middle and end of the show as well. At the time this show aired, these served as signs of things to come and the presentation of mysteries to the viewers. How will the images of Unit-01's bloody hand and of the bloody utility poles and Unit-01's foot unfold and appear within the story? What is the giant of light that possesses a silhouette that looks like an Eva? Who are the pencil sketches of the woman and the boy with the piercing gaze? What about the mysterious letters in the final scene? Or why does the caption "ANGEL" appear after the scene of the boy's face and the scene of Rei Ayanami? All the answers to the mysteries presented in the opening are presented in the show and the movies.

  --<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol2_introduction.htm>; Yes, what *about* those mysterious letters? TV script for the OP calls them ['angelic script'](http://wiki.evageeks.org/FGC:OP_Cut_085) and they resemble but don't match the real [angelic script](http://www.steliart.com/angelology_celestial_alphabet.html). [Patrick Yip](http://lists.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-March/011349.html) writes that a number of Japanese fan books analyze the script as distorted ancient Chinese for the NERV slogan "God's in His Heaven" etc.

> The name “Operation Yashima” is a reference to when Yoichi Nasuno shoots the fan with his bow from atop his horse on the beach in the “Battle at Yashima” in the first year of Bunji (1185). That’s Chief of Operations Katsuragi for you, quite the intellectual. In addition, “Yashima” written differently is also the old name for Japan. Thus, the name also contains a reference to the operation gathering electrical power from all of Japan.
>
...
>
> You can also enjoy the Kihachi Okamoto-esque camerawork that Director Anno excels at. The drama of communication between Shinji and Misato also hits a plateau. The segment From Episode One to this episode can be thought of as the “Prologue Arc” of the series.
>
> Misato is normally slovenly, but here, she gallantly stops the J.A. without any regard for her own life. Shinji is disappointed by the enormous difference between these two sides of her, but at the end, he learns that the reason she shows that defenseless side of her to him is because that’s how much she trusts him. Back-to-back with that is revealed the ironic truth that the J.A. going out of control and the miracle that Misato and the others brought about were all plotted by Gendo, but the way Shinji begins to walk forward when he understands that his relationship with Misato has become closer is refreshing enough to even erase the sense of upset.
>
...
>
> The name of J.A comes from the robot, Jet Jaguar, which appeared in the special effects film Gozilla vs Megalon (1973). Jet Jaguar was a robot whose design was chosen from submissions from the public, and when it was initially announced, its name was Red Alone. Jet Alone is a name made by combining Red Alone and Jet Jaguar. It is truly a geeky GAINAX-like name.
>
...
>
> This episode depicts the actions of Eva Unit-02 and its pilot, Asuka Langley Sohryu. Starting here, the series charges into the second part, the “Action Arc,” which depicts battles with various Angels in standalone episodes. The spirited character of Asuka ushers in a new phase of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Apparently, Asuka’s character became solidified in Director Anno’s mind when he came up with the lines “This is my Chance!” and “What are you, stupid?!”
>
...
>
> The contents of the trunk that Kaji is carrying looks like a human embryo and Gendo calls this “the first man, Adam.” In Episode Seven in the SSTO conversation, they were talking about the “revised budget for the sample collection,” but that sample is probably this Adam. Adam’s existence is one of the greatest mysteries in this show. Could it be related to the Adam that appears in the Old Testament? The name of Adam’s wife in the Old Testament is Eva.
>
...
>
> Episode Nine is also the episode where Asuka's character gets filled in. At the beginning in the scene where she talks to Rei at school, she is standing on the edge of the flower bed, but this is because in Director Anno's plans regarding her, one of the things was "she is a girl who endeavors to stand at a higher spot compared to the person she is addressing when greeting people." In Episode Eight, she also addresses Shinji from the top of the elevator.
>
> Asuka says, "This is the wall of Jericho, never to fall!" of the sliding door that separates the two rooms, but the "Wall of Jericho" is a reference to the Western film It Happened One Night (1934, America). In the movie, a rich runaway girl and an unemployed newspaper reporter end up spending a night in the same room, and they put a blanket as a divider, calling it the "Wall of Jericho." Incidentally, the original "Wall of Jericho" is a castle wall that appears in the Bible. Also, she says, "It is proper that boys and girls sleep apart after the age of seven," but the correct proverb is "it is proper that the boys and girls sit apart after the age of seven." This is a saying in the ancient Chinese Confucian text of The Book of Rites, and the seat refers to a straw mat. In ancient China, sitting on the same mat meant that the two were husband and wife. Is it the genius girl's pride that leads her to want to use difficult sayings, even though she's not supposed to be used to Japanese yet?

> At the beginning, Hyuga compares the data on the Seventh Angel and says, "Pattern blue, confirmed as an Angel," and at the time, the screen displays "BLOOD TYPE: BLUE." In the scene before that, with the data on the Sixth Angel that Ritsuko had analyzed, it also has "6th ANGEL pattern: BLOOD TYPE: BLUE." This indicates that it is an Angel. The term "BLOOD TYPE: BLUE" comes from a sci-fi film directed by Kihachi Okamoto called Blue Christmas (1978, Japan).

> There is also a scene depicting the three operators taking a break between work. Maya Ibuki is reading a romance novel. Makoto Hyuga is reading a comic magazine. Shigeru Aoba has a music magazine next to him as he mimics playing a guitar. Aoba's hobby is to play the guitar, and in Episode Eleven, he can be seen coming to work with a guitar case containing an electric guitar. This was never realized, but there was an idea of having him play his guitar and singing nearby Shinji and the others in the final scene on the hill.

> The model that the Eighth Angel was based on was the Anomalocaris, the largest carnivore of the Cambrian Period. The Anomalocaris was taken up on the NHK Special Life - A Long Journey of 4 Billion Years (1994, Japan), and at the time the show aired, the creature was a hot topic.

> Furthermore, this is also the one and only Angel that appeared somewhere other than New Tokyo-3. Its object is believed to have been one of two things, either the Unit-02 being transported by the Pacific fleet or the contents of Ryoji Kaji's trunk.

> This episode depicts the commotion and a battle with an Angel with the great blackout at NERV Headquarters in the background. Paper fans, candles, buckets and other small props that are generally not seen around NERV Headquarters make an appearance here. The "It's lukewarm" at the end of Part A is the one and only gag utilizing Gendo, but there are numerous humorous scenes, including when Hyuga takes over an election PR car and the various raggedy antics of the three Children. The glimpse into an awareness of the problem of modern life relying too much on a technological civilization could also be said to be very Director Hideaki Anno-like. The English subtitle is a reference to a sci-fi movie classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951, America)

> The animation for this episode was handled by Studio Ghibli, known for their work on such films as My Neighbor Totoro. Nozomu (written as "peek") Takahashi, the city assembly electoral candidate, who only appears as a name is a twist on the producer of Ghibli, Nozomu (written as "aspire") Takahashi.

> At the sea at the South Pole, where Gendo and Fuyutsuki travel on board an aircraft carrier, the waters are red and there are giant pillars of salt. This is also due to the effect of the Second Impact. Gendo calls the post-Second Impact South Pole “a world that has been purged, untainted by the original sin.” In general, original sin refers to the sin Adam, the father of mankind, committed in “Genesis” of the Old Testament, as well as to the sin that all of mankind was burdened with as a result of it. In the conversation in this scene, it is revealed that Fuyutsuki and Gendo disagree on various topics, such as the Second Impact, mankind, and science. Fuyutsuki says, “I prefer the world where man lives, no matter how tarnished by sin it is.” One wonders how he felt being involved in the Human Instrumentality Project.

> “By the hand of man” and “a miracle has value when it is brought about” are two lines that are familiar from some of Director Anno’s previous works. In this episode, it is revealed that Rei dislikes meat, but Nadia: Secret of Blue Water was also a vegetarian. Director Anno himself is also famous for not eating meat. Incidentally, Rei orders a garlic ramen without the pork at a ramen shop, but the script has Rei ordering seaweed ramen. It is a rare example of pure adlibbing on the part of a voice actress in this show.

> The supercomputer MAGI is composed of three different computer systems, Melchior-1, Balthasar-2, and Casper-3. Various calculations, problems and operations are examined by these three. The naming of the MAGI come from the three wise men from the East, who foretold the birth of Jesus in the "New Testament." The names Melchior, Balthasar, and Casper are also taken from each of the wise men. The word "magi" also means "astrology" and is the origin of the English word "magician."
>
> In order to prevent the Angel from invading the lower regions of NERV headquarters, Gendo completely physically seals off the region in the Central Dogma below the Sigma Unit. The pyramid-shaped building standing in the Geo-front is but a small part of the NERV Headquarters. Stretching directly below the square lake adjoining the pyramid-shaped building is an incredibly deep facility going down approximately 7km. The majority of this incredibly deep facility is called the Central Dogma and the Sigma Unit is a part of it. Incidentally, the name Central Dogma came from biology. Genetic information is transferred DNA=>RNA=>protein, and this flow of genetic information is called the central dogma.

> Every so often, the show was aired at an irregular time in the Tokyo region, such as on January 3rd, when it was aired at 8 a.m., and thus, Episode Fourteen was created as a recap episode of sorts. The English subtitle is also a reference to the fact that this episode is a recap.

...
>
> Part A has no BGM, and there is also very little dialogue. The lack of "sound" and the heavy use of Bold Mincho captions create a stifling tension. The structure of displaying the subtitle at the end of Part A was also effective. In addition, in Part A, the names of the Angels and operations that had appeared up through Episode Twelve "The Value of a Miracle" became clear. The names of the Angels are the same as the names of angels that appear in the Bible, and each of their spheres of influence, characteristics, and the situations in which they appear are consistent. At the end of Part A, the terms "Dead Sea Scrolls" and "SEELE" appear for the first time. Generally, the "Dead Sea Scrolls" refers to the ancient documents discovered in a cave on the west bank of the Dead Sea in 1947. They contained the "Old Testament," the "Apocrypha," and other religious writings not included in the Bible. They are thought to be writings from around 200-100 B.C., meaning around the era that Christ was alive. Though it is said to be the greatest find of this century, full disclosure of it to the public was dragged out for another 45 years. Additionally, there is speculation that parts of it have been deliberately withheld from being released due to it containing writings that shake the very foundation of Christianity. It is unclear whether the "Dead Sea Scrolls" that they speak of are the actual "Dead Sea Scrolls." SEELE is the controlling organization of NERV and its members seem approximately the same as the Human Instrumentality Committee. Seele means "soul" in German.

>
> In the final scene, what Unit-02 is holding is the Spear of Longinus that was being transported from the South Pole in Episode Twelve. In the Bible, the Spear of Longinus is the spear that pierced Christ on the crucifix.

> Starting with this episode, the drama is presented more densely, entering into the third part, which drives the theme strongly. The first episode in this part, Episode Fifteen, shines a spotlight on the human relationships between such people as Misato and Kaji, Shinji and Gendo, Asuka and Shinji, etc.
>
...
>
> Through Kaji's investigations, it is revealed that the organization created to select Eva pilots, the Marduk Institute, is largely insubstantial. The name for the Marduk Institute comes from a Babylonian god said to have 50 names. The god Marduk had 50 names, and the Marduk Institute in Eva was using 108 names.
>
> The homeostasis that Ritsuko mentioned is a biology term that refers to a quality that creatures have that allows them to maintain their physical and biological condition within stable levels and to survive in response to various changes in their environment. The American biologist Canon (Walter Bradford Canon: 1871 - 1945) proposed it as a universal principle of life. Combining that with its companion concept of transistasis to come up with the idea that "having these two contradictory qualities is what defines life" is original to this series.
>
...
>
> Episode sixteen depicts the fight against the Twelfth Angel that takes its opponent into imaginary space and Shinji's struggle within the inner space. This is an episode that could only be a part of Eva, possessing two very disparate appealing aspects in its depiction of sci-fi drama and the abyss that is the "human heart." And the scene of Shinji's inner space in the latter part of Part B could be said to be one of the finest examples of this. This sequence on board a train car at dusk with no one else present depicts the world of Shinji's heart in a most vivid way by using methods that could even be called experimental, such as expressing the character as a white "line" on a black screen and interjecting various images throughout the sequence. In addition, the image of "inside a mother's womb" can be taken from the entry plug that Shinji can't escape from, and the image of "giving birth" can be taken from the scene where Unit-01 escapes from within the Angel, covered in blood. Thus, this is also an episode with strong symbolism.
>
> In the inner space sequence, the question, "Is it okay to live by stringing only the happy things in life together like a rosary?" is presented, and later on, it becomes one of the themes carried throughout the series. In the same sequence, Shinji's mother, Yui Ikari, appears for the first time. Shinji's line, "No. Mother was smiling," serves as a foreshadowing to the mystery involving Yui. Also, there is a directional reason for why she is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara, who also voices Rei Ayanami.
>
> The episode title is a reference to "The Sickness Unto Death" (Sygdommen til Doden, 1849), the most important work put out by the father of existentialism, the philosopher Soren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-1855) of Denmark. "The sickness unto death" refers to "despair," and in the introduction of this work, Kierkegaard says that for a Christian, "Even death itself is not 'the sickness unto death.' Not to mention any of the suffering on Earth known as destitution, illness, misery, privations, misfortune, pain, anguish, grief, or regret." The English episode title, "Splitting of the Breast" refers to a psychological process by which an infant's impression of the breast becomes split into two, a "good object" and a "bad object."
>
> The "Dirac's sea" that took Shinji and Unit-01 in is a concept that the British theoretical physicist Dirac (Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac: 1902-1984) used in his hole theory. A vacuum is filled with negative energy electrons, and this is what is called "Dirac's sea."
>
...
>
> The three episodes spanning Episode Seventeen to Episode Nineteen are a serial piece called the "First Child Trilogy." This serial piece is the greatest climax in the middle of the series and also holds important meaning in terms of Shinji's drama. The first of these episodes, Episode Seventeen, is one that focuses on depicting daily life. The main plot is of Toji being chosen as the fourth Eva pilot and of how he finds his resolve concerning that, but at the same time, such things as Shinji's growth as a person, Rei's emotional uncertainty, and Hikaru's romantic feelings are also depicted. Episode Eighteen and Episode Nineteen, which follow, become more intense in terms of both drama and action. This episode is meant to be "the calm before the storm."

> In a conversation with Kaji, Shinji says, "You know, I'm a man." So far, Misato and Asuka have repeatedly harangued him about, "You're a man, aren't you?" and he never offered a response, but now, he says this without a hitch. Does this mean he is feeling more at ease, just as Toji had said in Rei's room? It is also noteworthy that he looks at Toji with a smile as Toji stubbornly declares that cleaning is not a man's job. In Shinji and Kaji's conversation at the watermelon field, the topics covered are once again "enjoying" and "suffering," following up on the inner space in Episode Sixteen "The Sickness Unto Death, and..."
>
> The people who performed the English operator dialogue at the beginning were Michael House, George A. Arriola, and Hiromi Arriola. Michael House was a GAINAX employee at the time, who did m-house translation work. George A Arriola and Hiromi Arriola were friends of his and are apparently husband and wife.
>
> The English title for this episode is "Ambivalence." Ambivalence refers to a state where two contradictory emotions or attitudes exist at the same time within an individual. It was originally a psychoanalytical term, which was first used by a Swiss psychoanalyst, Bleuler (Paul Eugen Bleuler: 1857-1939). Perhaps the title of "Ambivalence" was given to this episode because Shinji is conflicted between his mission to defeat Unit-03 and his emotional reluctance to fight Unit-03, which has a human pilot on board.
>
...
>
> As the story unfolds, Shinji resolves to fight on his own and gets on board the Eva. And with a fierce battle that can truly be called "a man's battle," Episode Nineteen is upheld by the fans as having the most exciting content in the series. However, what in fact defeats the Angel is neither his resolve nor his fighting spirit, but the berserk Unit-01. Having aggressively faced the Angel, Shinji is taken in by Unit-01 as a result, and there is not even any portrayal of him realizing victory. In that sense, this episode also has a most Eva-like ironic structure.
>
> The English episode title "Introjection" is a psychoanalytic term meaning "to take in." It refers to taking in various attributes of another person and making it one's own. It is one form of a defense mechanism. For example, by taking in a mother's prohibitive or denying aspects, the super-ego is formed. Introjection is a term that refers to a phenomenon that occurs in the world of the psyche, but in this episode, it is likely used both in terms of its original meaning and how Unit-01 took in the Angel's abilities.
>
> In the entry plug, Shinji's body has become one with the LC.L. and separated from his psyche, Ritsuko sets a plan in motion to reconstruct his body and get his psyche to anchor itself in it. As the English episode title "Weaving A Story 2" indicates, this episode is a summary of sorts, like Episode Fourteen. In point of fact, it is made largely centered around the reuse of already existing composite material and film, however its contents do not look back on what happened in the past but tell a completely different story. Having become an existence solely consisting of his psyche, Shinji agonizes and suffers over things like "his relationship to others" and "the establishment of self." Depictions in his inner space is the locus of this episode and just as in Episode Sixteen, experimental methods are abundantly used. Also, with this episode as a turning point, This show begins to show a stronger tendency to directly portray "the human mind."
>
> Ritsuko says that the Eva "contains a human will" and that the fact Shinji was taken in "might be the Eva's will as well." Misato felt she was saying it jokingly, but when considered along with things like how the story unfolds later and how Ritsuko said, "So, she's awoken..." in Episode Nineteen, it becomes clear that what Ritsuko said is conveying the truth to Misato to a certain degree.
>
> Towards the end of Part A, Shinji recalls that he knew the Eva even earlier and that when he found out, he ran away from his mother and father. And the images of that flashback are the scene of the experiment from Episode Twenty-One "NERV Is Born," in which Yui Ikari is the subject. Shinji ran away from that site, and that incident is likely what planted the compulsive idea that he "must not run away".
>
> While the final scene at the love hotel contained no explicit images, the love scene was depicted boldly, which caused quite a stir when it was originally aired. After touching upon Misato's tryst, Ritsuko's line, "I guess I'm in no position to talk," is also curious.
>
> The English episode title "oral stage" is also a psychoanalytical term. The oral stage is the first stage of development in Freud's (Sigmund Freud: 1856-1939) libido development theory. It is the time period when the mouth serves as the principal source of pleasure. It is said that the oral stage starts at birth and ends around the age of 1 1/2. in the scene where Misato and Ritsuko are in the car, a radio DJ show can be heard from the car radio. We can suppose that this is the same show that was airing in Episode Twelve. A woman DJ is advising a listener on their romantic problems, but the term "oral stage" appears here as well. In this case, the oral stage refers to the oral personality. In other words, it points to personality tendencies that strongly lean towards being dependent and needy for love People with an oral personality happily sacrifice themselves in order to obtain the love of others. Shinji could be said to have an oral personality at this point in time.

> Neon Genesis Evangelion has numerous mysteries to engross the fans. After all 26 episodes of the TV series were aired, the remake version of Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode were released as a theatrical piece, in which several of the mysteries were resolved. Or there were clues presented with which to think about the mysteries. Furthermore, in the video version (released on LD and VHS at the time) of Episodes Twenty-One through Twenty-Four, which were released after the movie opened, new footage was added that also presented information regarding the mysteries.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol6_introduction.htm>

> If you look at Eva as a story whose protagonists are Gendo and Fuyutsuki, then the heroine would be Yui Ikari. She fascinates Fuyutsuki and she says, "He's quite a sweet person," of Gendo. Gendo's resolve to advance the Human Instrumentality Project is surely also related to her disappearance. Many mysteries, such as the Eva and Adam, the circumstances of Ayanami's birth, Unit-01 going out of control, etc., are linked with Yui's existence.
>
...
>
> When it was first aired on TV, it seems no few fans suspected that it was Misato that shot Kaji in this episode. In the "video version," dialogue explaining that SEELE has discovered that Kaji has delivered a sample of Adam to Gendo and has made his position precarious has been added and the way the scene where Kaji is shot connects to the next scene has been changed. It leads the audience to think that the culprit is someone on SEELE's side.
>
...
>
> In the fourth part, the drama unfolds taking an even deeper look into the characters. Not only Shinji, but Asuka, Rei, and Misato are put through hearth-wrenching experiences. In Episode Twenty-Two, the spotlight is on the Unit-02 pilot, Asuka Langley Sohryu. It becomes clear why she had been so hung up on the Eva and worked so excessively hard, and when that is uncovered by the Angel, she loses her psychological balance. Just as it holds true for the Fifteenth Angel that appears in this episode, non of the Angels that appear in the fourth part launch brute force attacks, but instead, try to shake the Eva pilots psychologically.
>
> The big additions in the "video version" are the carrier at the beginning, the scene where Asuka is looking at Shinji and Rei at the station, and the bath scene. The highlight is the struggle in Asuka's inner space when she is being attacked psychologically, which took as much as 70 cuts to accomplish. In the station scene, she speaks nastily of Shinji and Rei's relationship, saying, "He is totally back to his usual thing again." Perhaps Asuka thought that the two were a couple or at least in a relationship close to it. Note that in the struggle in her inner space, a scene where she is hanging her head in dejection with the sliding door closed has been newly inserted after the scene from Episode Nine, "Moment and Heart Together," where she shuts the sliding door. And likewise, after the kiss scene from Episode Fifteen, "Lies and Silence," there is a new scene showing her looking frustrated after rinsing her mouth. And from Asuka's dialogue that overlaps these scenes, it becomes clear that she has been looking for help and love from Shinji.
>
...
>
> In the fourth part, the effectiveness of certain important scenes has been increased by the use of well-known classical pieces as BGM. The piece used in this episode is Handel's oratorio "Messiah." Messiah means savior and the lyrics have been taken from the Bible. The piece portrays the prophecy of Christ's birth all the way to his resurrection in three parts.
>
...
>
> Episode Twenty-Three is the episode where the spotlight falls on Rei Ayanami. The secrets of her inner thoughts, her death, and her third self are depicted. This is also the episode where Ritsuko's drama is depicted, and just as the title "Tears" indicates, Rei cries in the first half and Ritsuko cries in the second half. The way the story unfolds in a cool, detached way in spite of the fact the episodes portrays the life and death, and the love and hate, of the characters is very much in character with this show.
>
...
>
> Standing before the Reis in the tank, Ritsuko speaks of the relationship between Rei and the dummy plugs, and also of the relationship between "God" and the Evas. It is a scene that provides the greatest amount of information regarding the mysteries in Eva. What exactly is this "God" who disappeared 15 years ago? Was it not Adam appeared 15 years ago? She said that the "God" humans resurrected was Adam, but is this Adam the embryo-like Adam that showed up in Episode Eight? Or could it possibly be the giant underground? In the same scene, Ritsuko says, "The Chamber of Gaf was empty, you see." The Chamber of Gaf, according to Hebrew legends, is a room in the house of God in Heaven where the souls dwell. Babies receive a soul from this room before they are born. It is said that if there are no more souls in the Chamber of Gaf, it is an omen that the world will fall to ruin.

> Up to this point, Neon Genesis Evangelion has depicted themes surrounding "the human heart" and "communication between people" through the stories of the main characters.  However, the climactic episodes, Episode Twenty-Five "The World Ending" and the Final Episode "The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World," reverse the relationship between the story and the theme. What would normally be considered the story is kept to the bare minimum and "the theme itself" is told. The material is theoretical and experimental, and without a doubt, something never seen before in TV animation. When it originally aired, it became an incredibly hot topic and divided the fans in their opinion.
> The conclusion to the drama and illuminating the mysteries. In response to fans clamoring for those two things, it was decided that there would be a remake of Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode.  The result of that are Episode 25 "Air" and Episode 26 "A Pure Heart For You," which were released as the theatrical "The End of Evangelion."
> Thus, the story of Eva would branch into two stories with the diverging point being the end of Episode Twenty-Four "The Final Messenger."  The two stories each unfold differently and arrive at their own climaxes.  Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode tell the theme directly.  And the other version, Episode 25 and Episode 26, depict the same, following the story.  It is not that one is the complete version and the other is incomplete.  Just like the multiple endings of a game, two different endings were prepared for one story.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol7_introduction.htm>


> Kaworu only appears in this episode of the show, but his unique atmosphere and his relationship with Shinji led to his character garnering overwhelming support from female fans. When you disassemble the character for his last name, “Nagisa”, it becomes “shi” and “sha”. Thus, it is a play on the sub-title, “The Final Messenger (saigo no shisha)”. The “Nagisa (shore)” also forms a pair with Rei Ayanami's “nami (wave)”.
>
> Only the fourth movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Opus 125 “Choral” is used as BGM in this episode. Event what Kaworu is humming when he first appears and what Shinji is listening to on the S-DAT are from No. 9, showing quite a thoroughness. During the climax, it plays for over 7 minutes making a strong impact on the audience. The lyrics for the choral “Ode to Joy” are from the poem “To Joy” by the German poet and playwright, Schiller. There is a passage in those lyrics that goes, “We enter, drunk with your fire, Oh heavenly one, into your sanctuary.” it can be thought of as linking to the content of the second half of this episode.
>
...
>
> This is a singular piece of work with an exceedingly experimental structure. In spite of the story unfolding only through monologues and conversations between characters, the directing does a brilliant job maintaining the high tension. When it was originally aired, many voiced their opinion that they could not understand the story in Episode Twenty Five and the Final Episode. However, there is actually a bare-bones explanation of the story within the show. That being… Gendo uses Rei to execute the Human Instrumentality Project and the complementation of man begins. Seeing the remakes, Episode 25 “Air” and Episode 26 “A Pure Heart For You”, may in fact make the content of Episode Twenty-Five easier to understand. The depictions of Misato and Ritsuko being shot to death, Unit-02 hugging its knees in the lake, and Asuka likewise hugging her knees within Unit-02 all correspond to Episode 25.
>
> Gendo says, “All souls will become one and find eternal peace”. His Instrumentality Project must have been for all human souls to be combined as one and to compensate each other for what they have been deprived of. In the story that follows from Episode 25 “Air” to Episode 26 “A Pure Heart For You”, he was not able to execute the scenario he had drawn up. It may be that it was in Episode Twenty-Five and Episode Twenty-Six that his wish actually came true.
>
> The English subtitle, “Do you love me?” is from the book of the same title written by a British psychotherapist named R.D. Laing (Ronald David Laing: 1927-1989). It is a work that is done in a distinctive style as a discourse between individuals, and the style in which this episode is advanced through conversations between the characters is reminiscent of “Do you love me?”
>
...
>
> “Vividly drawing people” is a distinct quality of this show, and it was also the creative theme. In that sense, stepping deeper into Misato's mind using the reason she slept with Kaji as a lead into it can be called the end point for Neon Genesis Evangelion in depicting people.
>
...
> This is the final episode of the TV series. The year is 2016 A.D., and the complementation of mankind is ongoing. Shinji agonizes over the value of his existence and his relationship with other people and comes to a conclusion. The subtitle “The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World” is from a story by American sci-fi author Harlan Ellison (1934 - ) of the same name. Taking the subtitle of the final episode from a sci-fi novel is a tradition of Director Anno's works, continuing from Aim for the Top! and Nadia: Secret of Blue Water. The “love (ai)” being written in katakana is likely a play on the “love (ai)” and the English “I”.
>
> The final episode also takes the unusual route of unfolding entirely within what appears to be the world within Shinji's mind. In terms of technique, there are also various modes of expression used in abundance, such as still photographs, paper anime, and illustrations. Director Anno and the animator You Yoshinari are the ones who did the key animation for the paper anime.
>
...
>
> The moment that Shinji gains conviction that it is okay for him to be there, the background changes, and the blue Earth spreads beneath his feet. However, there are no continents on this Earth, and it is covered by a gigantic coral reef. It seems this is the Earth that has been transfigured by the Instrumentality Project. This episode ends with the captions “To my father, thank you.” “To my mother, farewell.” “And to all the Children.” “Congratulations!” Eva is something of an Oedipus complex story, where a boy feels love and hatred for his father and mother, so the first two captions can be thought to means that Shinji has come to an understanding with his father and grown out of his dependence on his mother. Perhaps the latter two captions mean, “This is a world where all the children born into it deserve to live.” It is left for the audience to decide whether this ending is the Best Ending or the Bad Ending.

> Taking him to the airport after Fanime one year, I asked Hiroyuki Yamaga about Anno and Miyamura, whether it was true they were going out (which was the story I had heard--not the story that she rebuffed him). If you've ever seen THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO, he was kind of reclining back in the car seat at the time like Jigen was, just before they blew the tire. He sort of gave a "where'd you hear *that*?" response. Mr. Yamaga is usually not shy about gossiping about Anno, which leads me to believe either 1.) they were never going out (90% possibility) or 2.) they were but jealousy forebade him from confirming it (10% possibility).

> It's quite possible that this struggle was interpreted instead as a struggle with Anno, which certainly made for juicier rumors. Nor was it all that far-fetched, as there was at times a great deal of tension within Gainax over the making of EVA.

> Anno was also at one time romantically linked with Ayako Fujitani, whose novel "Shikijitsu" he, of course, adapted into film. They apparently first met when she was starring in the remakes of the GAMERA series (Yamaga claimed at one time the real reason Anno walked away from KARE KANO was because he was too busy editing his "making of GAMERA" documentary). Ms. Fujitani is, of course, also the daughter of Steven Seagal, making the rumored relationship not without great personal risk.

> Bryan was taking some video of the people walking by as a snapshot of everyday people. Because it was Saturday afternoon, some of the people traveling through the station were school students returning home after a half-day at school. Of course, they were wearing uniforms of the style we learned to expect in anime. Although it may appear obvious and natural to some of you, my impression of everything we saw in Japan that matched what I had seen in anime was changing my impression of the country and its culture. What I came to realize is how accurately anime portrays many elements of Japanese culture. This means that I had to reevaluate the impression of Japan that anime had given me, and look more closely at what I had previously not considered accurate portrayals of everyday life: the sound crows make, the layout of city streets and railways, the hustle and bustle of daily life at a train station, the zoning laws, what people wear, what they look like, how they color their hair (^_^), what they eat for breakfast, the size and thickness of one slice of bread (^_^), and so on.

> Note: I'm not absolutely certain these are the reasons, nor are they necessarily the sole reasons, for Anno's departure from the production of Kare-Kano.

> Anno objected to the restrictions placed on TV anime by TV Tokyo after the Pocket Monster incident, so in protest, he decided to have nothing more to do with TV Tokyo and left the production of Kare-Kano in the hands of Sato, who joined Gainax after having worked for the government in a public works management position.

> "Actually, there *is* 'canon' that can 'disprove' this. Nationwide parental (PTA) objections against Eva's content are a known fact. These objections reached such a level (even receiving Japanese newspaper coverage) that TV Tokyo was forced to set up a screening panel including PTA members which effectively 'nixed' the original episodes 25 and 26 that were currently under production. (ie: The 'intended' script/storyline was submitted for reveiw but rejected.) Being forced to redo two entire episodes from a late stage led to the time and budget restrictions which resulted in still images, stick figure animation and telops."

> "The End's main characters are a man and a woman, Shinji and Asuka, and director Hideaki Anno when he does not present himself through Misato, Gendo, or every other character in the series identifies with them both (gossip links him romantically with Asuka's voice actress, Yuko Miyamura). As Anno explained at the outset of the series, in an essay reprinted this month in Viz's collected Book One of the Evangelion manga, he began this because he felt sick, and the final line of The End, spoken by Asuka back to Shinji, could not put things any more plain."

> "This is The End of Evangelion. It is the same ending as that of the television series. It is told big-budget, stitched with bullets, limned with guts, and tagged with blood, in case it was too subtle the first time. But it is the same ending. You will see all this: a man, stunted in emotion, has a special gift within him. He can move his human hands and feet with the stride and reach of a giant. Because he knew love once, and lost it, he sketched one map on his floor where he stood and one in the sky above, until he had drawn between them a world of mysteries and wonders, a world of things to love and of those in love. But when they put their hands towards him, he drew away; when he put his hands on them, they were cold and still. In his frustration, he tightened his grip to take satisfaction by force: a load shot to nowhere, a stranglehold on beauty, clenched fists battering down his creation, until there was nothing left but himself again."

> By breaking with the long-standing tradition of basing their animated works on pre-existing stories and folk tales, GAINAX has been credited with freeing animation from the constraints which have allowed it to be perceived as a derivative medium. In so doing, they have established animated film as a self-sufficient art form (Time Magazine, November 22, 1999).

  --<http://www.evamonkey.com/writings_gleicher01.php>

>  In a recent issue, Rolling Stone proclaimed Nirvana's Kurt Cobain to have been, for western popular music, the Artist of the Decade. I have no problem with that assessment, any more than I have in saying Evangelion's Hideaki Anno should hold that title for Japanese animation. But both made their statement when there was still plenty of Nineties left: Cobain killed himself in 1994 and Anno's pop culture suicide happened in either the spring of '96, when Eva had its controversial TV ending, or in the summer of '97, with its even more talked-about movie ending-you may take your pick. Therefore, the reason Cobain and Anno deserve the title is not that their talent bestrode the decade like a headless colossus, but because they posed the question of what will you do, now that you know to all those that came after them. Evangelion suggested, as Nirvana did in both their first and last song, "you could do anything, you could do anything..." Yet it seemed that few in TV anime chose to respond to Eva's example of freedom of expression. In 1998, serial experiments lain (the title is in lower-case) came and went from Japanese television in a mere thirteen episodes. But it was enough to show that lain's creators, scriptwriter Chiaki Konaka (whose previous Armitage III was also produced and released by Pioneer) and newcomer Ryutaro Nakamura had understood the possibilities and chose to seize upon them.

> Evangelion is an ambiguous product. On the one hand it strongly appeals to otaku's sensibilities, (2) but on the other it implies radical criticism against otaku's mentality....
>
> In a sense, Evangelion is extremely interior and is lacking in sociality, so that it seems to reflect pathology of the times. I think for some people it is nothing more than a bad product which is simply to increase otakus.
>
> For instance, some Japanese critics, such as Eiji Otsuka and Tetsuya Miyazaki, criticized Evangelion TV series on the grounds that the last two episodes, in which interior monologue of Shinji, the hero, went on all the time, were like brainwashing or psycho-therapy, and it was only a self-affirmation of otaku's autistic tendency for escapism. Yoshiyuki Tomino, who had once directed several epoch-making animes such as Gundam and Ideon, (3)-these animes had a great influence on Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion-also criticized Evangelion bitterly on the grounds that it is something like clinical records of a morbid person who confines himself to the world of information and cannot realize actuality....
>
> The latter half of Evangelion TV series, especially the last two episodes clearly had intention to break the closed domain of anime that keeps on offering narcissistic pleasure to otakus, that is, Evangelion had intention to crack the closed domain of anime, not from the outside, but from the inside, remaining within it, just as its purity is highest, or to make joy of anime self-destruct at the utmost limits.
>
> The last part of Evangelion TV series-in which the progress of the story was stopped by Shinji's interior monologue and he came to affirm himself groundlessly, saying "I can stay here!"-was not a play for the salvation of the self-some people misread it so-like brainwashing or psycho-therapy, but something like harassment with malice and irony to some anime fans. I think the last message of the last episode of the TV series-"Congratulations to all the children!"-was a quotation from the last scene of Yoshiyuki Tomino's anime movie The Ideon (1982), as many people have already pointed out it. In the last scene of The Ideon, after the human race had died out, the souls of the dead characters were drifting in outer space and they heard the singing, "Happy birthday dear children!" That is ironic, in short, the last episode of Evangelion TV series implies that closed and self-sustained interiority is nothing other than a kind of "death." It is death of the self as loss of the other. It also implies that the world of joy for otakus such as the first half of Evangelion TV series cannot help coming to a death on account of its closeness....
>
> The world of the first half of Evangelion TV series, which had been full of joy of anime, collapsed gradually in the latter half: In the 18th episode, Evangelion Unit-01-Shinji was inside it-attacked Evangelion Unit-03 as an "Angel," and Touji, the pilot of Evangelion Unit-03 and Shinji's classmate, got badly wounded and lost a leg. In the 22nd episode, Asuka, the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, became as good as the living dead because of Angel's psychic attack, getting non compos mentis. In the 23rd episode, Rei, the pilot of Evangelion Unit-00-in the episode it was found that she was something like a clone created from Shiji's mother-blew herself up in order to protect Shinji from Angel's attack, and the city Shinji lived in-Third New Tokyo City-became a ruin. In the 24th episode, Shinji was forced to kill Kaoru, a boy who was Shinji's beloved friend, as an Angel, or enemy. In the last two episodes, the progress of the story was stopped and the work Evangelion itself broke down as if to reject a completion of itself as an anime. It is, as it were, closing of the world, or "death" itself....
>
> The latter half of Evangelion TV series, in which a world of joy was collapsing and closing because it was simply hedonistic and regressive, reminds me of Mamoru Oshii's anime movie Urusei Yatsura 2 Beautiful Dreamer (1984). (4) In Beautiful Dreamer, an endless slapstick comedy at a high school like Urusei Yatsura TV series-Oshii himself had directed the TV series-is depicted as an ideal world to Lum, the heroine, or an occurrence in Lum's inner space. In the world, the progress of time has stopped and one and the same day-the day before the school festival-is being repeated over and over. In the inner space, the people who were hindrances to Lum vanished one after another, and the town she lived in became a ruin except for the house Ataru Moroboshi-the hero and Lum's "darling"-lived in and a convenience store nearby. The more the purity of the world as Utopia to Lum is enhanced, the more the closeness and fictitiousness of the world become prominent. Ataru wandered about in the world of inner spaces like this and then tried returning from the infinite chain of the inner spaces like "dreams" to "actuality."
>
> The End of Evangelion presented the thesis that actuality is the end of a dream. Concerning the thesis, Oshii's Beautiful Dreamer precedes Anno's Evangelion. If the world of Urusei Yatsura TV series had switched suddenly to the level of Beautiful Dreamer, it would have been similar to the last two episodes of Evangelion TV series. The reason that Evangelion TV series seemed to break down at the conclusion was that the shift-from fiction to meta-fiction-was too sudden and self-destructive. It may be that the people who showed rejection reaction to the last two episodes of the TV series could not bear its irony and self-referentiality.
>
> The world where Shinji operated Evangelion Unit-01 and fought against the Angels, the world of a comic love story at a junior-high school, in which there were no Evangelions or Angels (the last episode of the TV series), the world where the people congratulated Shinji and he came to affirm himself groundlessly, and the world where Shinji, Asuka, Rei and Kaoru were rehearsing a string quartet at a hall of school (Evangelion: Death)... It can be thought that each of these worlds was an occurrence in inner space, or one of parallel worlds. The theme of Evangelion is, so to speak, the world as interiority....
>
> The End of Evangelion, released as a movie, is a remake of the last two episodes of the TV series, and it is the last program of Evangelion series. I think the largest point in dispute connected with the evaluation of this last program is this. Did Evangelion only end in a self-affirmation of closed interiority, or did it show the way to get out of prison of self-consciousness?
>
> It seems some people anticipated that the movie version of Evangelion would end as a story of "growth and independence of a boy," like a Bildungsroman, but The End of Evangelion avoided such a popular ending and was completed as works that renewed the last two episodes of the TV series in another way. The End of Evangelion is a repetition and variation of the theme presented in the latter half of the TV series. It is not an ending of a story....
>
> This [EoE] ending can be regarded as criticism against religion, because it avoided an ideologic/aesthetic solution and faced the ugly reality. It is highly ethical. The people, who equated Evangelion with motivational seminar or the Aum Shinrikyo cult and called it 'techno-mysticism', should be ashamed of their thoughtlessness.
>
> In my view, The End of Evangelion ended on the phase when Shinji, the hero, found Asuka as "the other." For Shinji, Asuka is an ambiguous existence. On the one hand she lectures and inspires him because she minds him, but on the other she is also an existence beyond his control-the other that can never be interiorized. Asuka's ambiguity is also the ambiguity of the work Evangelion as it is.
>
> The last two episodes of Evangelion TV series and The End of Evangelion have a relation like a Möbius strip. They are the two views of one and the same theme. The discovery of the other in The End of Evangelion is the reverse expression of the loss of the other in the last two episodes of the TV series. The unsophisticated people who could not read the irony in the last two episodes of the TV series will probably overlook the critical essence of The End of Evangelion as well.

> Tomino: For instance, Brain Powered came out after Evangelion did, so I am often asked questions similar to yours about the connection between them, but in reality the plans for Brain Powered and the overall story had all been completed before Evangelion came out. I never meant Brain Powered to be an antithesis to Evangelion. I knew when I saw Evangelion that Brain Powered would be called an antithesis to it, but I didn't want to change my plans any, so I just resigned myself to that.
>
> This is connected with my wish for more animators to see themselves as entertainers. I don't think I succeeded with Brain Powered, and I don't think it was very good with entertainment--but there was one thing I did try to do with it. If 100 people come to see an anime with giant robots, then chances are that not every one of those 100 people will be a huge fan of robot anime. What I wanted to do was to make an anime that had a truly interesting story that wouldn't cause the people who watched it to have a nervous breakdown. I also tried to make a story that would tell anime fans that there were often other things out there better than anime. That's the goal I challenged myself to do. I don't think the series itself was a success, though, I have to admit that.
>
> So I was very upset when I saw Evangelion, because it was apparent to me that the people who made it weren't thinking at all about making fun for or gaining the sympathy of the audience. Instead they tried to convince the audience to admit that everybody is sick, practically in the middle of a nervous breakdown, all the time. I don't think you should show things like that to everybody. It's not entertainment for the masses--it's much more interested in admitting that we're all depressed nervous wrecks, I thought. It was a work that told people it was okay to be depressed, and it accepted the psychological state that said if you don't like the way the world works, then it's okay to just pick up a gun and attack someone. I don't think that's a real work of art. When people see that, they begin to realize they are the same way. I think that we should try to show people how to live healthier, fuller lives, to foster their identity as a part of their community, and to encourage them to work happily until they die. I can't accept any work that doesn't say that.

> Animerica: Is that different from your downbeat endings?

> Some of the jokes, gags, and elements in FLCL are subcultural, and if it was very difficult for him to explain some of the elements to the staff, it may be even more so to Americans—or so is his assumption. Tsurumaki told the Otakon panel, "Honestly speaking, I'm very happy that Americans like my work, but the Eva TV series and movies, KareKano, and FLCL are basically made for the Japanese audiences. So when I hear that they are being well received by American audiences, I feel very happy; but at the same time I feel a little awkward."
>
> When PULP asked him what he meant by that, Tsurumaki said, "For example, in Eva, I thought Shinji's character would only be understood by Japanese fans of this generation. But I was very happy—or actually, shocked—to find out that his kind of character is also understood by Americans." I appreciated the director's implied vote of confidence in us, but wondered whether the oft-remarked-upon Japanese sense of cultural singularism was strong enough to cancel out the universal fact of youth disaffection, let alone the worldwide reporting on incidents such as the murders at Columbine.
>
>Another person at Tsurumaki's press conference took up that question. Tsurumaki averred that Shinji's character was based personally on that of Hideaki Anno. Tsurumaki's version of the metaphor was that Shinji being summoned by his father to pilot the Evangelion stood for Anno being "summoned" by Gainax to direct their first anime in four years, and his in five—he traced Anno's ambiguous feelings about his craft back to Nadia. At the same time, said Tsurumaki, Anno felt, "But maybe by doing Eva I can change, I can grow."
>
> Most of the Gainax shows are also targeted, Tsurumaki said, for an audience "that tends to be rather weak and has problems with their family"—and the directors at Gainax are those kind of people. "A lot of families in Japan a generation ago—and perhaps even now—had fathers that were workaholics and never home. They were out of their children's' lives. My own father was like that, and I hardly ever got to associate with him until quite recently. I'm the same sort of person as Hideaki Anno. That probably influences the type of anime I create."
>
> Nevertheless, if Tsurumaki feels that he will never be safe, he will never be sane, he wanted to express that frantic inside in a comedic mode, rather than with the violent convulsions of Evangelion. Simply put, he personally was ready for a contrast to that apocalyptic darkness. Tsurumaki compares the bizarre robots popping forth from Naota's head to stir up the town in FLCL to the bizarre ideas popping forth from his head during its production, stirring up the post-Eva Gainax. For someone involved with such a talked-about film, Tsurumaki hardly ever watches movies himself, telling the panel he receives influences instead from Japanese TV dramas and manga, his favorite being those of Leiji Matsumoto.

> None of the Evangelion production staff are themselves of a Western religious background. Tsurumaki, for his own part as assistant director, said at Otakon that he always envisioned the extensive use of Judeo-Christian iconography in Evangelion to be more of a way for the show to distinguish itself visually in the mecha field. Evangelion's eschatology is in fact too well-developed to be regarded as a mere motif, however if it is a syncretic, symbolic and esoteric approach, it is not an ignorant one. Tsurumaki remarked that Eva, being a show only meant for Japan, allowed Gainax to creative freedom in the use of Western elements, removing any concern about how their interpretation might cause offense. By the same token, Yamaga has expressed a sense of relief that Gainax couldn't be easily smeared with the media hysteria over Aum Shinri Kyo, since Evangelion's own high-tech cultists used Western, not Buddhist, revelations. It should be obvious that if this is viewed as an armor for Evangelion to comment on contemporary Japanese events, it is an effective one—an applicability many Japanese critics in fact accepted.

> P: Do you think, then, that the distinctive Gainax projects are the ones which actually originate from within the studio, rather then their adaptations of someone else's work?
>
> KT: It depends on the time in which it was released, but yes, works like Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise, Gunbuster, Nadia, and FLCL would be considered the ones with the true Gainax flavor, their milestones.

> Tsurumaki said he was surpassed that Shinji Ikari was understood so well by North American Evangelion fans, and admitted that Shinji was modeled after the director Hideaki Anno. "Shinji, he gets summoned by his father to ride a robot, and Anno was summoned by Gainax to make a big animation show after he had had a problem with Nadia of the Mysterious Seas and didn't know if he still wanted to direct." Some fans think that the extreme violence in End of Evangelion was inspired by fans' disapproval of Anno, but Tsurumaki said that was not the case. "It wasn't a bitterness toward the fans. A lot of people think anime should always have happy endings, but that's not always the case. We wanted to educate the fans that anime can have bitter endings."

> "Why does Evangelion end violently, and somewhat unhappily?
>
> KT: People are accustomed to sweet, contrived, happy endings. We wanted to broaden the genre, and show people an ugly, unhappy ending.
>
> Why is the character of Shinji portrayed as he is?
>
> KT: Shinji was modeled on director Hideaki Anno. Shinji was summoned by his father to ride a robot, Anno was summoned by Gainax to direct an animation. Working on Nadia [Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water, one of Anno and Tsurumaki's earlier projects] he wondered if he still wanted to work like this. He thought that working on Eva could help him to change.
>
> Is there any particular reason why so many Gainax series feature very anxious, unhappy young male protagonists with no parents?
>
> KT: Yes, the directors at Gainax are all basically weak, insecure, bitter, young men. So are many anime fans. Many Japanese families, including my own, have workaholic fathers whose kids never get to see them. That may influence the shows I create.
>
> Could you explain the mecha bursting from Naota's head in FLCL?
>
> KT: I use a giant robot being created from the brain to represent FLCL coming from my brain. The robot ravages the town around him, and the more intensely I worked on FLCL the more I destroyed the peaceful atmosphere of Gainax.
>
> Why doesn't FLCL follow one story?
>
> KT: In the third episode Ninamori was almost a main character, a kid who, like Naota, has to act like an adult. After episode three her problem was solved so we wrote her out. She has many fans in Japan and we got plenty of letters about that decision. For FLCL I wanted to portray the entire history of Gainax, and each episode has symbols of what happened behind the scenes on each of Gainax's shows. Episode one has many elements of KareKano; episode two, a lot of Evangelion references, etc.
>
> Where does the title FLCL come from?
>
> KT: I got the idea from a CD in a music magazine with the title Fooly-Cooly. I like the idea of titles that are shortened long English words. Pokemon for "Pocket-Monsters" for instance, and an old J-pop band called Brilliant Green that was known as "Brilly-Grilly."
>
> Is there any reason why the extra scenes added to Eva for the video release were cut in the first place? Did you think the story would mean something different with them intact?
>
> KT: The scenes that were added to Eva for its video release aren't that important. We added them as an apology for taking so long to get the video out. Maybe they'll help people understand things, because the episodes were done under tough deadlines the first time around.
>
> Earlier today you said that you were trying to broaden the genre by giving Eva a sad ending. Does the sameness of much of today's anime bore you?
>
> KT: First of all we didn't use a sad ending to annoy fans. When they're upset, that really bothers us. Personally, I think a happy ending is fine, but not if it is achieved too easily. That's no good.
>
> Can you explain the symbolism of the cross in Evangelion?
>
> KT: There are a lot of giant robot shows in Japan, and we did want our story to have a religious theme to help distinguish us. Because Christianity is an uncommon religion in Japan we thought it would be mysterious. None of the staff who worked on Eva are Christians. There is no actual Christian meaning to the show, we just thought the visual symbols of Christianity look cool. If we had known the show would get distributed in the US and Europe we might have rethought that choice.

> "The question of what worked and what didn't therefore doesn't seem a pertinent one to me; to me the show is about dysfunctionality: of the artist, of his creation, and of his artistic attempts to phrase and portray that creation. If Evangelion "worked" it would be Gasaraki or Brain Powerd. Less flippantly, it might be Gundam or Getta Robo G. But what would have been the point of making them again?"
>
....
>
> "We've seen instances, from Anno in interviews, to the pseudo-exposes of Otaku no Video, to comments by people we know, that they eventually got tired of the grinding unreality of anime, which became quite as oppressive as the grinding reality they thought to escape by becoming an otaku. The problem with that explanation for me is that I don't believe one ever escapes from reality, the challenges of existence, the issues of having been born into this world: of being a human being.
>
> Rejecting the otaku and his works isn't going to teach you how to see, any more than the rigorous motions of otaku culture will make you go blind. Upon embarking upon his post-Eva project KareKano, Anno remarked as an epigram for the show that "reality has no mercy". He based his approach to the series in large part by talking to students in contemporary Japanese high schools: trying to restore the conversation he had cut off when he was their age."
>
...
>
> "The complaint may certainly have some validity within Gainax itself. Anno himself foresaw this in "What Were We Trying To Make Here?", when he said, "I know my behavior was thoughtless, troublesome and arrogant. But I tried. I don't know what the result will be, because I don't know where life is taking the staff of the production. I feel that I am being irresponsible. But it's only natural that we should synchronize ourselves with the world within the production." The synch rate wasn't always 100%. Masayuki, Kazuya Tsurumaki, and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto had their own ideas; Ikuto Yamashita, the man most responsible for the distinctive mechanical designs of Evangelion, had his detailed scenario for how the story should end (it would have involved the "emergence" of the Eva units).

> Much has been made of the fact that the sense of anger, disgust, and confusion pervasive to Studio Gainax's smash-hit series NEON GENESIS EVANGELION  wasn't something done simply to follow the tradition of anime's angst-filled robot jocks, but was rather a personal emotional confession of its director, Hideaki Anno. Not only did Anno frighten and shock new audiences when they glimpsed an intense, reflexive honesty anime creators rarely think (or, perhaps, think better than) to put on display, but towards those converted to hardcore fans, Anno displayed a sometime mocking attitude towards their obsessions and expectations for EVA (and as an otaku himself, this was of necessity also self-mockery). Horrified or vilified, it didn't matter?audiences ate it up with a soupline ladle, and EVANGELION became the greatest commercial success in Gainax's history.
>
> But Gainax had tried this once before, and it was their greatest commercial failure. It was a different time, 1991, and the approach was satire, not drama. Some have even gone as far to say it was the chilly reception of their forth production, 1991's OTAKU NO VIDEO, which ushered in the four-year absence of the studio from new anime ventures, broken spectacularly with EVANGELION. Actually a compilation of two videos released separately in Japan in that same year, OTAKU NO VIDEO 1982 and MORE OTAKU NO VIDEO 1985, AnimEigo's release of OTAKU NO VIDEO is a unique document in anime: Studio Gainax's confession of their feelings as obsessed fans, or "otaku" -- part satire, part autobiography, and part wish-fulfillment. OTAKU NO VIDEO's structure cuts back and forth between anime and live-action. The anime portion, with unforgettable character designs by Ken'ichi Sonoda (BUBBLEGUM CRISIS, GUNSMITH CATS), tells the story of Kubo, a clean-cut young university student who gets gradually sucked into the otaku lifestyle and, subsequently rejected by society, vows to become "Otaking," and attempts to "otakuize" the human race through building a mighty corporation that will sell "otaku culture" to the world. The live-action portions contain mocking, purported interviews with "real otaku" whose identities are concealed in the style of a tabloid-TV "true crime" show.
>
...
>
> But OTAKU NO VIDEO hardly bore an auspicious name as it sat on store racks. The name of Tsutomu Miyazaki -- a serial killer arrested in 1989 whose otaku background was exploited as a media circus (in a manner not unlike the live-action segments of ONV) -- was still fresh in the public mind, and made Gainax, to any potential mainstream audience, appear to be merely exposing a distasteful pathological subculture. Which, of course, is what they were, in fact doing, for the purpose of laying all their cards on the table. American anime fans are often concerned about the image the mainstream media may present of their devotion; in the light of such fears, ONV was a pre-emptive strike. The black-comedy truth is that any mainstream-media exposé could not possibly put otaku in a worse light than the one Gainax shines on itself. Yet ONV's satire also branches out to encompass the larger society, as it portrays scenes of "normal" people who would never fall prey to obsession and bad culture like an otaku, standing in line for hours to buy a designer-label sweatshirt or going to quality fare like a revival of KRAMER VS. KRAMER. And of course, respectable corporations in ONV are quite happy to take over and market the creations of otaku operating out of six-mat offices and give those same creators the old heave-ho.
>
...
>
> And Gainax was clearly out to bite the hand that fed them?the bent-over, twitching, hentai computer game-otaku, socially paralyzed, hiding from the sun, has got a card from Gainax's own NADIA on his PC-98, and is activating his manual hand release to Gainax's own dirty on-screen program, "Cybernetic High School." The contrast between ONV's anime portion -- upwardly-mobile, world-striding anime otaku designed by Sonoda, overcoming every setback to make their culture the culture of all mankind -- and the otaku of ONV's live-action portion -- stark, low-res, poorly lit, crudely obscured, and not likely to ever leave that room -- gave ONV  a schizophrenic quality that must have made it difficult for many hardcore fans to bear.

> 21. Expansion of Blockage
> This is the most amazing BGM that is played dramatically throughout the TV series and the movies. It is no less than impressive that throughout this nearly 7 minute long BGM the pictures are perfectly in synch. Director Anno previously made a comment that he wanted to "break down the blockage" in his TV anime making. He thinks that one of the reasons EVANGELION had such a huge success is that this blockage that he talked about synchronized with general society's own blockage. Apparently this series jumped out from the frame of anime and became the EVANGELION boom; however, it's not like it was delivered to society. More or less society stepped into the world of EVANGELION...? In contrast to the more open visual scenes (set aside either from self-ridicule or sarcasm), it is a title that consciously expresses something.
>
> 22. THE HEADY FEELING OF FREEDOM
> (OP Strings)
> Although it came to such a climax when Episode 24 of EVANGELION was aired on TV, none of the mysteries were solved in the last show, Episode 25 [Sic]. Due to the consistent effort to portray an avant-grade, play-like depiction using experimental techniques, fans' shock and confusion were not measurable. It was just like Shinji would say, "You have betrayed me!" However if you watch AIR and SINCERELY YOURS along with the last two episodes from the TV series, you'll realize their stories have common story lines although their expression methods are different from each other. Coincidently, we have put together Track 21 and 22's strings, and Track 23 and 24's piano's beginnings and endings which are naturally connected to make a suite from the last two songs from the TV series and movies.
>
> 23. Good, or Don't Be. (OP - 2D type)
> Generally an in instrumentally arranged opening theme is used very often in the film as a BGM, but in EVANGELION, only previously mentioned Track 22 and this one are used in the final episode. Therefore, this song would have become a suitable song to decorate the finale with such a sense of accomplishment. The TV series ended with the impact of destroying a stereotype that in an anime's final episode everything had to be settled.
>
> 24. Opening of a Dream (Piano - Leave It To Version)
> Shinji's independence that he bid farewell to his mother and chose to live in the world of others despite the fact that he would hurt others is portrayed in this song with a somewhat sad piano solo. It is as if it suggested the relationship between the project of EVANGELION and audiences.

> Mr. Anno ("Evangelion") apparently never read the Bible, despite the heavy Christian symbology of his work; he just (according to Mr. Okada) picked out a few interesting technical terms. Likewise, the anime creation staff might open a book on psychology and, rather than read it thoroughly, simply go through it picking out "great technical terms" to use in the anime!
>
...
>
> How have otaku in Japan changed in the past 20 years due to the influence of computers? Mr. Okada said that, in the past 10 years, otakus have seen less and less of a need to hide their otakuness. But more than this, the Internet helps them connect with other otakus and make friends. However, a drawback is that they no longer sit under tremendous pressure - the dual pressure of loving anime and of yet having no outlet. The dual pressure often led to the person going out and doing something, but now, the fact they have outlets means they don't have the pressure pushing them to action any more.

> Secondly, the job demands dedication. Mr. Leiji Matsumoto, creator of "Captain Harlock" and "Galaxy Express 999," apparently was talking with Mr. Okada and Mr. Hideaki Anno at one point, and remarked: "Any man that takes more than four baths in a year cannot do anything truly great!" The idea: a person who truly devotes himself heart and soul to a project won't have the time or inclination to bathe for months on end. But the truly shocking part of the story was that Mr. Anno, standing next to Mr. Okada, was nodding and making noises of agreement!

> "Daicon IV" was deliberately made to be the same length and cel count as "Daicon III" - however, its particular theme was slightly darker, along the lines of destroy the old to create the new. It also played with the fun of half-losing one's sanity - the semi-insanity necessary to devote oneself to anime.
>
> For example, an audience member happened to ask about the "GAINAX bounce," a characteristic jiggling of the female cartoon character's breasts. This was apparently introduced in "Daicon IV" by Mr. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who added in the margin of the animation instructions: "Make this scene a little erotic (H)." The animation industry reacted with shock to this animation ("Is it OK to do this kind of thing?") and of course the technique was promptly adopted by other animation houses, including Cream Lemon's porn features.

> With "Evangelion," Mr. Okada said the animators were not quite confident about it, so they ran a manga 4 months before, both to garner some popularity as well as increase the odds of funding.

> Anno: Yes. Escapism is a "medium"\*, among other things. From behind reality, there's a refuge when it comes to "equipment". Sort of like winning a girl's heart, it looks unpleasant. During the time we shouldered the film (97 was when it played in theaters) originally such plans were transparent. Audiences were doused with water\*\* right away, something that enlightened them and made them want to go home. That's the sort of thing I wanted it to be. And so, I picked up on that "service".\*\*\*
>
> Anno: I think audiences picked up on a good thing. They continue to stay within their comfort zones, but I also think that one service in Eva's case is it was already a hopeless atmosphere.
>
> Anno: At least becoming enlightened seems to give a motive that it's necessary to do something... That good thing seems to be what audiences say; the conclusion developed from that sort of thing. I can confidently say I picked up on such "service".
>
> Notes:
>
> \*This term was used in EoE. Best example comes from EoE's Theatrical booklet: "[Medium (YORISHIRO)] An object which attracts divine spirits (= souls) or which acts as a media through which these spirits manifest themselves. In episode 26', Fuyutsuki refers to Eva-01 as a "Medium" (Well of Souls) when SEELE uses it to create the Tree of Life."
>
> \*\*Purification ritual, akin to baptism that is performed before material arts and such. Because it sounds similar to "being hit with a bucket of cold water", perhaps Anno is referring to how the start of EoE shocked audiences right away with the masturbation scene...
>
> \*\*\*Anno seems to mean fan-service as well as a general kind of "service" (favor/action) being performed for somebody else.

> "Recent remarks by Gendo and Fuyutsuki of NERV seem intriguingly to confirm that certain details of the Angels differ in this version of events. Although the first Angel to appear, Sachiel [in Stages 1-5], had been previously assumed to be the Third Angel as so coded in the anime, it is now suggested that in this version of events it was actually the Second. Fuyutsuki commented that the Angel Sahaquiel [Stage 30]--the Tenth Angel as coded in the anime--was actually "[number] seven," to which Gendo replied, "Yes. And five remain." According to this differing classification, then, the Third Angel would be Shamshel [Stages 9-10], the Fourth, Ramiel [Stages 15-19], the Fifth, Gaghiel [Stage 20], and the Sixth, Israfel [Stage 22-26]. Note that the Angels Sandalphon and Matarael--the Eighth and Ninth respectively--have not appeared in this version of events, as they did in the anime where they followed Israfel and preceded Sahaquiel."

However, I think that the industry rests too much on large successes like Gundam, which you could call the "Old Type," which is a little annoying with a magazine which is called Newtype. As I said earlier, the world of animation follows a regular cycle. The cover of the 10th anniversary issue was Evangelion, the cover of 20th is Gundam-- thus it is logical that the cover of the 30th will again be Evangelion. You’d better reserve it as of now."

> "When I first met Anno in college...the first thing he told me was how he knew every line in SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO, except for the first episode, and the reason he didn't know every line in the first episode was because he didn't record it, and the reason he didn't record it was because he didn't know if the series would turn out to be any good...What you saw in OTAKU NO VIDEO is pretty much what happened."

It was also the last production Gainax made before the four-year gap that preceded EVANGELION.
>
> Today it's common for anime to be made specifically for and about otaku (COSPLAY COMPLEX, COMIC PARTY, GENSHIKEN), but Gainax, being the original gangstas, did it first. Compared to such recent titles, OTAKU NO VIDEO is both more idealistic and more insulting about being an otaku; ONV keeps cutting between the anime segments, where the young members of Gainax (called "Grand Prix" or "Giant X" in ONV) boast that they will "otakuize" the world, and live-action interviews with pathetic, ashamed, and anti-social otaku in reality. Both images, as far as Gainax was concerned, were, of course, true.'

- Anno's [announcement](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies) of _Rebuild_; see also Funimation's [translation](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2010-June/006315.html)

> '"Twelve years is enough time for you to be able to look back on earlier works objectively", he explains. "Shortly before we started this project, Anno had a big Eva marathon where he watched the whole series in one go.
>
> The first thing he said when he finished watching was, 'This show really is interesting, isn't it? I never realized how interesting it was'. That comment really shook me."'
>
...
>
>  "Everyone was completely burned out during the second half of the original TV run and the movies, but now they're fresh and enthusiastic again. They've gotten older, but they're still full of energy. It's almost like watching kids prepare for a holiday celebration. The staff will also include a bunch of younger twenty-somethings who decided to join the anime industry after watching Eva and being inspired. " [Otsuki?]
>
...
>
> "It's true that Eva was a huge hit," Otsuki says. "But its success spawned a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding in the in the industry, the end result being a bunch of mass-produced junk. That mindset has persisted for ten years, but now we're in a position to prove it wrong. We're determined to close the door on the post-Eva era for good.
>
...
>
> The complexity has been somewhat lessened to make it more accessible to newbies, but it'll still take a bit of thought to understand." Otsuki adds that they're removing much of the deliberate obfuscation that made Eva infamous: "Filling works with difficult words and concepts in order to create confusion among viewers was a good technique 12 years ago, but not anymore, and one of our primary goals for this project is to turn everyone's expectations upside down."

> "Frankly, it just got too chaotic," Tsurumaki comments on the brainstorming sessions that were initially meant to provide an overall plot outline and final resolution to the story. "We're all working from the assumption that we weren't able to reach our destination with the original TV series, but the exact nature of that "destination" is still unclear to everyone on the staff. Since we're going to all the trouble of making these new productions, we'd at least like to take the story as far as we took it back then, but it's been an uphill struggle so far.

The Internet has made it so easy to zero in on others with your own interests that we've raised a generation of nerds mired in their own tiny spheres of influence. Fans of a given genre use information technologies to surround themselves with like-minded people in impenetrable cliques. The thought of a broader society beyond their own tiny subculture never occurs to them. Call it the "otaku singularity" worldview.

[No, we always hope that our work is successful and appreciated by many.] On m'avait demandé de faire un personnage assez sombre. [I was asked to make a rather bleak person.] A vrai dire ce personnage a été inspiré d'une chanson assez populaire au japon qui parle d'une jeune fille toujours entouré de bandelette.

<http://blogsuki.com/archives/2008/05/25/1415/>:

> “How did you come up with the idea for Gurren Lagann?”
> The answer: Toys. Yamaga-san seemed happy to answer this one. I’m paraphrasing the answer. He was quicker than what I could write down. He said that he met with a business contact who asked him, “Do we make a Gundam-like animation?” The contact continued, “Gundam is awesome, appeals to little kids and old school fans, and it can alternate between the two audiences easily.” Yamaga-san then pointed out that another company is responsible for Gundam and continued that this person was an earnest person and took the advice seriously. He then later ran into a president of a toy company who told him that “Giant robots are eternal. They never go away.”
> “Being a creator, I took it as a challenge. Trying to make a robot show that appeals to kids and adults.”...The two GAINAX guys did talk briefly about their other giant robot show and how they wanted Gurren Lagann to be different from that one. What is interesting is that they came up with the basic mecha concept and the name, but most of filling out the story was left to the director and the scriptwriter.

> The next question concerned the sixth episode, and if GAINAX drew inspiration from their older work. “We are GAINAX. We will parody ourselves.” (Bandai later clarified that the TV version of the sixth episode will be shown on Sci-Fi, but the DVDs will have the DVD version or maybe both versions.) A big part of why they had two episode sixes was that they had a hard time with the Japanese censors. It was not because they were running late or whatever.

> After that, a question about GAINAX’s financials that was answered with “We walk a tightrope of bankruptcy and lowering our animator’s wages.” (Note: most of the animators were in the audience.) “We don’t do more than 26 episode series because we’ll go bankrupt.”

> Keeping with the naming question, how did they come up with the name, “Gurren Lagann“? “‘Gurren Lagann‘ sounds Japanese and foreign, so that was good. Honestly, the meeting to decide the name lasted three minutes.”

> Next question was “Why did it start airing on Sunday morning? Wouldn’t afternoon be a better time?” The panel (don’t remember who, my notes only said, “ZOMG, cute Nia cosplayer in the third row.”) answered that Sunday morning is actually the new primetime for anime. They said that a few years ago, the weekend afternoons were great for anime, but now it has shifted that Sunday morning is where the ratings are at. They aimed Gurren Lagann for that time slot, and they had to deal with more censors or something to that effect. My notes aren’t clear…

> After that was a question on the large faced mecha design… “Director’s idea to do robots with large faces. Because it is strange, we do it.”

> Then I got to ask my second and final question, “Are Simon and Kamina apologies for Shinji Ikari?” Brought the room down with laughter as well as a face palm from a few panelists. Yamaga defiantly said, “What do you mean apology? Why does we have to apologize? Shinji is a great character.” He seemed like he meant it.



> 1. Whose idea was the new Evangelion movie series project, and how did it come to be?

> The project came to be through director [Hideaki] Anno. All I know is after he developed the concept, he pulled together the team of which I am a part.

> ...

> 6. Was it hard getting the original cast from the TV series together to do the films?

> This is something that I wasn't involved with, but it seems that the director was able to just pick up the phone and everyone flocked back.

> 7. Without spoiling anything, what are some of the differences fans can expect to see between the original TV series and the upcoming movie series?

> There's quite a bit of new visuals, some new designs, the coloring has been updated. Because we recorded the voice overs first, we were able to get a different sort of expression from the voice actors. There will be new plots and new stories involved as well. It's a brilliant work and I hope fans will really enjoy it.

> 8. What was the hardest thing about making the films?

> I wouldn't say that there were any real obstacles or anything difficult; it was quite the opposite because the original Evangelion was such a huge hit in Japan that many of the staff in the intervening time have become the top of their fields within animation, so to be able to work with the top people in animation was an incredible opportunity, and I don't remember any true difficulties.

> Toshio Okada on old-school, hundred-proof  "Otaku 1.0" from the Eighties: "individuals who chose to pursue childish hobbies as a means to intellectually and emotionally isolate themselves from society."
>
> Toshio Okada on the current generation of otaku: "a growing ghetto of weak individuals who blame society when others fail to understand their personal interests."
>
> Toshio Okada on himself: "I'm done."
>
...
>
> He portrays the rise and fall of Japan's otaku in three stages. The first generation are called "otaku aristocrats" -- early adopters from the late Seventies and early Eighties who felt the need to proselytize and convert their friends to the lifestyle. This sense of noblesse oblige eventually gave rise to the second generation of "otaku elite" from the late Eighties through the late Nineties, who spurned and scorned anyone without the good sense to share their taste in entertainment. And finally, this self-centered attitude reached its apex in the current generation of "moé-otaku," purveyors and consumers of anime, comics, and video games that feature infantile female characters instead of plotlines.
>
> Okada defines the otaku crowd he grew up with as a group of "individuals who chose to pursue childish hobbies as a means to emotionally and intellectually isolate themselves from society," defending their behavior as a form of rebellion and empowerment. According to Okada, this early generation of otaku weren't outcasts but rather noble outsiders, individuals who were more than willing to face public scorn rather than give up the things that were important to them. Essentially discriminated against by society at large, they had no choice but to circle their wagons and wall themselves off from it, like native Americans (yes, that is his parallel) forming reservations in an attempt to preserve their way of life. In other words, it wasn't a hobby, it was an cultural group, a tribe
>
...
>
> In contrast, Okada takes the current generation of otaku to task for continuing to "ghettoize" themselves, retreating ever-deeper into individual virtual worlds when they encounter any sort of resistance to their interests. Where's the sense of pride, of camaraderie? he wonders. He decries their inward focus, their passivity, their apparent lack of desire to learn about or interact with subcultures outside of their own tiny worldviews. (The last is a hallmark difference, at least in Okada's idealized view, between the moe-otaku and traditional old-school otaku, who actually forced themselves to partake of genres or titles they didn't particularly like in order to broaden their horizons.)
>
...
>
> In the end analysis, Okada's swansong is as much about the collapse of Japan's bubble era (which fueled the super-consumerism that allowed the otaku to flourish) as it is about the collapse of a subculture. Whether you consider him an astute analyst or a sentimental relic pining for times long gone by, there's no question that Okada played a key role in articulating the subtleties of otaku culture to the outside world. Now that he's officially declared Otaku 1.0 dead and buried, who will speak to the secret lives of their modern counterparts?

> Sadamoto: The original Evangelion film, End of Evangelion really expressed (creator) Hideaki Anno's psychological landscape at the time. I'm taking Anno's story as a basis, and filtering it through the lens of my own interpretation. I've always considered Evangelion to be, at its heart, the story of the relationship between a father and his son. I've been pursuing this angle from the outset of the manga series, and I'd like to pursue it to the end.
>
...
>
> S: The new films were originally intended to be a sort of "digest" of the original television series, but as you can see particularly with You Can (Not) Advance, they've begun to take a direction of their own. The theme will be that of isolation, if I'm not mistaken, and I don't believe that the story will be connected to my manga adaptation. That said, I'd like it if fans appreciated the new films and my manga version as separate stories.
>
...
>
> S: Around the time Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise came out, I was young and competitive and channeled all of my efforts into drawing characters that were as detailed and realistic as possible. Taking note of this and reflecting upon it as I began the character designs for my next project, Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water, I tried to make characters that were more animated and expressive, the way that they are in manga. Moving from that project to Evangelion, then on to The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and eventually to Summer Wars, I think that I've slowly eased back into a more detailed and realistic style. Well, FLCL and Diebusters are exceptions, of course (laughter).
>
> Particularly with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summer Wars it was important for me to create designs that fit (director) Mamoru Hosoda's ungilded style of presentation, with the result that, visually, I think the designs do share a lot in common with the designs I did for The Wings of Honneamise.
>
....
>
> S: The new films are so accessible! It really surprised me; it wasn't what I had been expecting. There are certain small details in the presentation, like the way music from the Showa Period is played in the background, that I thought were very Anno-esque, though (laughter). In general, the new films are something just about anybody can enjoy and appreciate. Anno's really calmed down since getting married (laughter).
>
> A lot of people are saying that Shinji is much more optimistic and willful in the new films, particularly in You Can (Not) Advance, but I've always thought that the original film, End of Evangelion, was the exception. Shinji is pretty dark and introspective in End of Evangelion, but I never got that impression of him watching the television series. I was really moved by Shinji's strength and unwillingness to give up in You Can (Not) Advance. I also thought that Rei's character was much less of a question mark. She was more fleshed out. Her speaking style is so rapid fire (laughter)! I really thought that you can perceive her gradual change in character in the new films. Asuka's also more approachable as a character. In a bit of a change from the original series, she doesn't just reject Shinji outright, but actually displays a degree of jealousy. Her character feels more like an actual teenage girl.
>
> The original series, the original film, and the new films are all windows into Anno's inner world, so it's interesting to see all of these changes.
>
...
>
> S: I thought it was fitting that the new films should include a new character. I really strove to design a character who was distinct from Asuka and Rei, though I do worry that there are some small but telling similarities that remain. My idea was to create a character so distinct from the other Evangelion characters as to almost feel out of place in the Evangelion world. I suppose I could've designed her as a sort of "halfway point" between Asuka and Rei, but Asuka and Rei are both such strong characters, in their own separate ways. I wanted to bring something completely different to the table with Mary.
>
> For Mary, I'd been asked to design a character who "goes about with a parasol, like the sort of heroine you see in an anime". As I initially designed her, she was very adult-like, having attended a strict private Christian school in Britain. However, in the original script, there was a scene where she returns home to a room full of birds and dogs and begins talking to them, to indicate that she was also rather idiosyncratic. Mr. Anno had also requested that she be more adult-like in appearance and manner than either Asuka or Rei, to set her apart. And that she have a huge chest (laughter).
>
> There was a television drama I'd really been enjoying at the time I began designing Mary. The heroine in this drama had a pair of long ponytails. I really liked this character feature, and worked it into Mary's design. After all was said and done, we ended up with the design that we have now, although there are still many elements of my personal tastes and interests of the time in Mary's design (laughter).
>
> Incidentally, I decided to give Mary glasses because I thought that this would be a simple yet affective way to set her apart from the other characters. Some people have said that she "doesn't seem like an Evangelion character", which is exactly what I was aiming for. I'm glad to see, though, that the majority of people have appreciated her character.
>
> YA: How did you go about designing Mary's uniform and plug suits?
>
> S: I'd been asked to make Mary seem very British, so I tried to design accordingly. For her school uniform, I thought that a large bow and long socks, along with a traditional checked skirt, would look the part.
>
> For Mary's old plug suit, I combined a rich green that seemed to me very reminiscent of British clothing with the design aesthetic of the space suits the Soviets were using around the time of the Cold War. The Soviet space suits are the reason for the checkered pattern of the lower half of the suit. Because Unit Five uses a lance, I also looked at a lot of fencing outfits and tried to incorporate elements of those into the design of her suit, as well. However, I also included what look like large plugs where pipes and the like could go, to convey the impression that this is, after all, a plug suit just the same as those of Shinji and the others.
>
> On the other hand, when I designed her new plug suit, I wanted it to look more sleek, capable and well-crafted than the other plug suits. I wanted it to have the appearance of something that was just manufactured using the latest technology. For inspiration, I looked at the design differences between the Lotus Elise Series I and Series II. Lotus' vehicles really have that feel of a classic design updated to the cutting edge.
>
> ...
>
> YA: We don't suppose you can drop any hints about the upcoming, third Evangelion film?
>
> S: Actually, I've yet to hear anything from Anno at all, so I really can't (laughter). Even with things like Mary appearing in both You Are (Not) Alone and You Can (Not) Advance, the story followed that of the television series to some extent, but who knows? Maybe the next story will be a complete departure from the television series. Given the possibilities, it should really be interesting to see where things go from here.
>
> YA: Which do you think will end first, the new films or the new manga series?
>
> S: Hmm... good question (laughter). I think I'd like to wrap up the manga series first, and begin to devote my time to Q, my upcoming project.

- Share with us your impressions after reading the script.

— [Megumi] Wow! I did not expect! This is a breakthrough! Otpad, I burst!

...

- Do you think, what actually changed "Eve"?

— [Megumi] It has become a bit brighter, such as light of heart, but that's all. In the same series, before sharing feelings with each other, Asuka and Shinji just playing games, just having fun with Kensuke and Toji. And it's all very strange. There is clearly some kind of trick.

- What are you so impressed in his story?

- [Maya] I said that Marie had destroyed "the former Eva".

...

— Parting words filmmakers somehow affected the result?

— [Maya] When I heard about the "destruction", then realized what an important role, and at the same time extremely responsible mission entrusted to me.I'm sure: to destroy the so ingrained image of the product, the new creation must be a monstrous adventure. And I threw all worries about leaving "Old Eva", and decided to voice Mari as some kind of an alien element, that today's Anno needs.

There was an interview with Tsurumaki in which he confessed that during the production of "Ha" they still weren't sure about what to do with Mari, even the name which was tentatively "Mariko". They HAD to have a new character (a new pilot), but they didn't have much of an idea as to what to do with it. That says a lot about all this. <http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=357818#357818>

["Interview: Gainax's Hiroyuki Yamaga"](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2010-06-03/interview-gainax-hiroyuki-yamaga):

<http://www.evageeks.org/2010/05/gainax-panel-at-fanime-2010/> / <http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?t=9158>

> Someone asked if Neon Genesis Evangelion ended the way it did due to budget problems. Yamaga responded that the problem was with time, not with budget. He then stated that the television ending was planned to be as it was from the beginning; Gainax thought “Wouldn’t it be interesting if the show ended this way?”. I brought up that the 1993 proposal created to attract sponsors contains a different ending in its summary, and asked if the propsal’s ending was made up because nobody would sponsor a show if they knew what the real ending would be. Yamaga knew nothing of the proposal and told me that if I got my information off the internet, somebody probably made it up. I responded that the proposal was in Newtype, and upon the translator’s request repeated that the proposal was from 1993. Yamaga responded that he didn’t believe the show had an ending at that point.

> Someone asked about the canceled Wings of Honneamise sequel. Yamaga said it was never canceled, but is on indefinite hiatus. The man who was to sponsor it was arrested for financial matters the translator was vague about, but he’s out of jail now and building a rocket that he intends to fly into space.

> A man said “You probably get asked this a lot, but” the television ending of Evangelion was “not well received by a lot of people”, and asked if End of Evangelion was created as revenge against the fans. Yamaga said that everyone at Gainax was satisfied with the TV ending, repeating that it had been planned that way from the beginning, but once the show was over the staff still wanted to do “more Eva”, so they made the films. For the sake of making sure Yamaga had to repeat himself a third time, Sailor Stardust asked if the script for episode 25′ was based on the intended script for episode 25, and Yamaga said once again that the television ending was the one they’d always intended. Fans like to make up rumors.

In the same vein, <http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=359336#359336>:

> According to Hiroyuki Yamaga, they had no budget problems with Eva, but they did have scheduling problems. This is consistent with Tsurumaki's statements in the Red Cross Book. Whas I found really surprising, because I've never seen this stated anywhere, is that Yamaga insisted that Neon Genesis Evangelion's television ending was planned from the beginning. In his (translator's) exact words, they thought "Wouldn't it be interesting if the show ended this way?". I asked if the alternate ending in the 1993 proposal was made up because they knew nobody would sponsor the show's real ending, but Yamaga didn't know what I was talking about. He said that if I got my information from the internet, someone probably made it up. I said the proposal was printed in Newtype, repeated (at translator's request) that it was from 1993, and Yamaga responded that he didn't believe the show had an ending at that point.

Yamaga must be treated cautiously <http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=359409#359409> as NAveryW remarks:

> "Yamaga has made contradictory statements in the past and even during that one panel. For example, someone asked about the international anime industry and Yamaga mentioned that anime studios, including Gainax, now have an international audience in mind and try to make series Americans will like. However, a few questions later, Carl Horn asked about how the language barrier affects internationalization, and Yamaga responded that it's impossible for them to tell what shows foreign audiences like so Gainax just does things the way they've always done-- making shows for Japanese audiences."


>  Some of Gainax's works become particularly famous for their soundtracks, particularly FLCL, as well as Evangelion and Gurren Lagann. How does Gainax approach the music? Does it come later in the production process?

> We don't decide the music on our own at Gainax. Depending on the series we have different sponsors, like Evangelion had King Records, who said we had to use their musicians. For Gurren Lagann we were working with Aniplex, which is part of Sony, so we had to use Sony artists. We actually wanted a guy rock band to do the opening music, and Sony said that they didn't have one, so how about using Shokotan, and that's how Shoko Nakagawa sang the opening song. So sometimes stuff like that happens, and that's how music gets selected. Weird coincidences and stuff.

...

> That's good, because some fans out here feel like some studios are pushing out moe  show after moe show and that they aren't really trying to push the boundaries anymore. Do you have any thoughts on that?

> I don't think it's just Gainax that's trying to push boundaries…the companies that are still around are the ones that are doing it right. But with so much moe anime out there…I think that only one or two of those titles really sold well, and anyone can see that, but they keep producing it…which is why I don't want to do it! But if moe was really selling that well, we'd probably do it too.

...

> What do you think is the biggest fan misconception about Gainax-- one thing people might assume about Gainax and its employees that just isn't true?

> That we have lots of money. That's so not true. I remember some fans from overseas came to see our office, and since Gainax is such a well-known name they thought they'd see some impressive building, a big high-rise or something...but it's just a regular small building, they were quite shocked.

...

> Was that a specific goal in designing the EVA units? Bigger than Gundam?

> Originally we wanted it to be as tall as Ultraman, but Ultraman is maybe 45 meters, so if you put him into Tokyo NOW, he'd be shorter than the buildings, because they were a lot shorter in the '60s! So to keep the same scale we had to make the EVAs taller.

> Do you think Anno will ever be done with Evangelion? Will these movies really be the final version, or do you think someday he'll come back again?

> That I do not know. That, only Anno knows.

[Fanimecon 2010, day 2](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2010/day-2):

> "Dark Horse manga editor Carl Horn, who edits _Evangelion: The Shinji Ikari Raising Project_ and the upcoming _Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse_, asked whether Gainax concerns themselves with their overseas audiences, which Yamaga answered more or less with a no."


Carl Horn [writes](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=369167#369167) about [rumors](http://www.japanator.com/rumor-gainax-and-evangelion-remakes-splitting-up--15139.phtml) that Gainax & Khara are bitter enemies:

> "Anno and Yamaga go way back; they were in the same dorm at college, and have been making films together just as long. I asked Yamaga-san directly about the Gainax/Khara split. He said that it wasn't that he and Anno had a fight or anything, it was more that in 2006 Yamaga wanted Gainax to make _Gurren Lagann_, and Anno wanted Gainax to make _Rebuild_. Since they couldn't make both at the same time and Anno was set on _Rebuild_, they came to an understanding that Anno would form his own studio for that purpose; i.e., Studio Khara--and that way, of course, both anime got made."

> The face of "Asuka with the torn off identity" speaks in Kaworu's voice.
> K: "It's not like you."
> A: "Not like me?"
> K: "Being happy doesn't fit you."
> A: "My happy self is scary. // So let's go back to the usual me."

> And then she takes her face back again.

> "In addition, I noticed that for the last 2 episodes, everything seems to take place on a stage.  I don't know if this was mentioned earlier, but I think it makes even more sense as to the fact Shinji is on a stage, and thinking, contemplating about his existence, since it seems that a large number of people (including himself?) stopped existing on the physical plane.

> Also, a bunch of friends noted that the sheet of paper that is shown shortly after the dream sequence, is the actual script of the dream sequence, and afterward, Shinji appears to be reading a book, looking up, and saying something to the effect of, "so, this is the reality" or something like that."

Allegory:

1. NERV = Gainax
2. Tokyo-3 = Anime Industry
3. Evangelion = Evangelion the TV series
4. Ikari Shinji = Anno Hideki

> "BTW, it's on page 175 of NewType Evangelion 100% collection book in the section of The voice of Evangelion. Basically a bunch of letter written by Evangelion fans about their experience of watch the series. So I'm not the one creative enough to dream that up.

> I went back to the book and read it again....apparently those parallel came out of a discussion/interview done by NewType with the Anno himself.

# Tangential materials

From the Kotaku message board from whence this post originates:

Why can’t young men wed anymore? I think it is because men can no longer say to women, ‘I can always protect you,’ in this dog-eat-dog world of restructurings and layoffs – such words are now unreal.

Women as a result now target two groups of men: “ikemen” (handsome, cool men), and rich men, the so-called ‘Hills tribe’ (referring to the ultra-prestigious Roppongi Hills residential tower).

But most men have neither money nor good looks, and as a result women will no longer consider them. Surprisingly, I've heard of cases where a chosen man will end up dating dozens or hundreds of women.

Since the ikemen and the rich monopolize the women, all that remains is a sterile desert, where normal men can no longer find a partner, so they flee to Akihabara and find love in the arms of an anime character.
