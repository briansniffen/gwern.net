# Otaku no Video
## The bright side
## the dark side

The remarkable thing about _Otaku_ is that at the breaks, it switches from the anime to short filmed videos with various otaku (Gainax staffers)

# EoE & TV are the same ending

> How does that make any sense? In the movies Shinji rejects instrumentality, in the series he embraces it. The two story lines are mutually exclusive. Or have I missed something completely? It has been a while...

I think you missed something. I've always regarded the 2 endings as complementary, not contradictory.

Obviously EoE is about external events, action; and obviously the TV is about internal events, introspection. But the TV's action matches up with EoE's action (the Misato and Ritsuko bodies, for example), so we might expect the introspection to match up as well.

I won't trouble you with excerpts from the script (as this is an old Eva argument, it's been done before and better), but go back and look at the [Episode 26 synopsis](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Episode_26#Synopsis). Notice how the whole episode is about Shinji coming to grip with how it's better to exist, and exist as a separate person. The entire series is skeptical about the value & desirability of Instrumentality:

> In fact, she and other characters say, it’s true for all humanity, this weakness. It’s why Instrumentality is taking place. Humans cannot live alone, but yet they are separate entities: thus conflict and pain is created. Humans cannot live but in Instrumentality. "Really?" asks the text.

Or the final moments are quite telling:

> After seeing this, Shinji realizes that there are alternate possibilities to his Shinji decides that he can learn to love himself, and he wants to be "me" and to stay "here". The dark world shatters, and Shinji is left standing atop a coral reef under a sunny sky, surrounded by most of the other characters. He is wished "Congratulations!" by the human cast (and a squawking Pen Pen), and smiles, thanking everyone.

If he's accepted Instrumentality, then who is doing the congratulating, who being congratulated, and for what?

Specific plot points aside, why would the two endings be contradictory? Most people accept that part of the reason for the TV ending's experimental techniques (or crappiness, for some) was due to budget and internal Gainax issues. Why would Anno have the budget and time to do EoE, and decide to do an ending exactly opposite the one they wanted to do but couldn't? (Don't say Anno's revenge; that is untenable) If Shakespeare could go rewrite _Hamlet_ again with an unlimited [SFX](!Wikipedia) budget, would he suddenly decide to rewrite it to have a contradictory ending (maybe one where everyone lives)? Of course not. There's a particular artistic viewpoint being expressed - it does not allow for casual flip-flops. If the TV ending really is an acceptance of Instrumentality, then it renders everything *meaningless*, all the fighting and scheming and suffering and attempts by characters to come to grips with themselves.

Or, Instrumentality is consistently pursued by SEELE - an immoral group of powerful manipulative men. Shouldn't we distrust anything sought by the likes of *them*?

'Running away' describes Instrumentality exactly; are we supposed to think, 'hey, Shinji was right all along, and not being cowardly and immature'?

Seeing both endings as rejections of Instrumentality and an embrace of reality fit exactly with the constant message of the series ('We cannot weave our lives only out of things we like'), and fits exactly the 'Eva-as-otaku-therapy' paradigm I personally subscribe to.

So: seeing the endings as covering the same end is what Occam's Razor suggests; it makes most sense artistically; it makes sense from a production standpoint; it consiles with what we understand of Anno's inspirations and pre-Eva life; it's what a straightforward plot reading suggests; and so on. (We *could* argue against or ignore all that, but I hope I've shown any such argument would be quite strained.) I feel if you rewatch with all these points in mind, you'll change your mind as well.

---


Well, it seems you have to be alive to be in Instrumentality. Consider that in EoE, we don't see Kaji or Misato or Ritsuko or Rei or anyone we know for certain to be dead after the end. We see Misato's cross nailed to a makeshift grave, suggesting Shinji is certain she's gone.

And the only other person to reform out of the LCL is Asuka, who we last saw inside a half-eaten Eva - but not dead for certain. Eva are pretty tough, and the only pilots who die are ones who activate the self-destruct or whose capsules are pulled out and *then* crushed. It doesn't seem implausible that the harpies munching on Eva-02 caused Asuka extraordinary suffering but didn't actually manage to kill her before they became busy helping Shinji start Third Impact.

In the TV series, we don't see the external results, so we can't point to the ending. But definitely in the TV (and maybe EoE, I forget), the images of Misato/Rei/etc. specifically say that they are the public personas, the masks, the versions of them inside Shinji's mind, the Misatos that he knows - and not the 'real' ones. Hence, there's no mystery how people like Kaji could show up at the Congratulations!, as his mind can work off memories.

(On a side-note, one of the interesting things about Eva is that there may *not* be anything like an eternal soul! Yes, surprisingly, for all the mention of souls, Eva/Anno seem to use the term more or less interchangeably with mortal minds. There's never any real suggestion of an afterlife for souls, and Yui's desire to make an eternal mark or monument to humanity doesn't make much sense if souls were eternal. Further, the additional backstory added by the 'Secret Information' of the PS2 game is very atheistic - Lilith and Adam are just [panspermia](!Wikipedia) projects set up by ancient aliens.)

So, who is being congratulated? Shinji. Who is congratulating him? The personas in his mind, perhaps, or maybe Instrumentality itself, or maybe his mother (Yui is almost always off-screen, yet her concern that Shinji grow up and deal with his issues still comes through loud and clear in her characterization), or maybe himself in general. It isn't clear & doesn't really matter (none of those choices affects the meaning, I think) - the point is that Shinji has made the right choice, the choice that isn't running away, the choice that will let him walk by himself into whatever future there is, the choice that isn't fleeing into an anime-like fantasy world (again, the Eva-as-otaku-therapy theory works perfectly), that isn't weaving his life only out of things he likes. Where is he being congratulated? That's pretty clearly in his head. The floating island is unreal, even if we ignore EoE's depiction of a ruined bloody world.

# Eva is meaningless
> I'll give you a simpler Occam's Razor: Anno went off the deep end, and he ruined what otherwise was a good series; in fact, what could have been one of the greatest anime series ever.

I don't really see how that's a simpler hypothesis: you're proposing that a radical one-time change (Anno going off the deep end for just the TV ending) is simpler than the null hypothesis (Anno tried to do the same thing in both works)?

And I don't entirely think the ending makes sense on a plot level. The whole Angels business is ill thought out. The creators are constantly dancing and [retconning](!Wikipedia "retroactive continuity") in the series and movies, trying to make the plot-level hold together. And the plot is ultimately too shallow to bear the weight people put on it; one is done an disservice, almost, by essays and articles that lead with a plot summary. It's not the Angels or fights, as interesting and well-done as they may be, that are the raison d'etre of NGE, but what happens between and because of the Angels and fights; they occasion the events we care about. "..ultimately, the plot of Evangelion wasn't very interesting", writes one fan.[^weise]

TODO: move this to the end: [^weise]: ["Saving What Counts: Reflections on the End of Eva"](http://www.abcb.com/eva/essay_02.htm), Matthew Weise, 16 November 1999:

     > "The supposed "real" ending of Eva, the movie, is what it took to make me realize exactly what it was that the show did right. The movie gives you the labyrinthine plot that Evangelion was building up to and ironically proves that, ultimately, the plot of Evangelion wasn't very interesting. The pop-theology and religious name-dropping that the series liked to indulge so much in are brought to the foreground resulting in total chaos, with the ideology of the series being splintered into a thousand pieces as characters are bent and twisted to conform to the plot which ends on a note of glaring philosophical pretense. In retrospect, the series finale of Eva seems wise to simply forego its narrative and opt for the exact material that the movies failed to address: the individual anxieties of the human beings involved in a familiar, real world context.

They fail, of course; the 'Secret Information' plot data from the PS2 game even finally admits that some of the Angels were headed for Lilith, some for Adam, and some had no plan in mind - which is a transparently failed plot. Anno had a good deal to do with the SI, so I take that section as him basically saying 'the explanation is that there is no explanation; stop obsessing about it'.

So in that sense it doesn't translate well onto celluloid. The simple approach would simply be to write an essay on how it's painful to exist, quote some Buddhism, some existentialism, and maybe Schopenhauer on the Hedgehog's Dilemma. But would that speak to otaku? No, not really. It might speak to philosophers, but they wouldn't need such an essay. How do you animate those ideas, get people to relate to them? How would you put those ideas into character form, what sort of story do you write?

Why then am I so interested in a failure? Because while it's a failure on the level of straight mecha - a series like RahXephon is infinitely better as mecha, or the better Gundams are clearly superior even if Eva can boast novel organic mecha designs - it's most definitely not a failure on the psychological/philosophical levels. In my other comments I mention my Eva-as-otaku-therapy theory. What Eva does so brilliantly is diagnose the otaku condition (the alienation, the apathy, the unhappiness and pain of it), how it is the general human condition, and the painful solution. It does so throughout the series, and does so thoroughly while creating characters that *last*. (What other characters from 1995 are so memorable and vital 14 years later? Why do Rei/Misato/Asuka capture their archetypes so perfectly?) The poison slides into the otaku stomach pleasantly, with plenty of fan service, until suddenly the ill-adjusted otaku realizes he is on the couch with Anno hm-hming.

Other Gainax series are like this: _Otaku no Video_ for example mixes its glorification of otaku with disconcerting video segments; FLCL is another. Outside of Gainax, therapy anime are rare but often quite good; _Serial Experiments Lain_ and _Welcome to the N.H.K.!_ come to mind. (_Genshiken_ does not; it whitewashes and glorifies otaku with only token criticisms.)

If your time was wasted watching it, then perhaps you should feel *glad* about that - glad that you didn't need it. (Some people do; remember the ['Death threats'](http://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats)? Read the translations and note how many of them speak of how the viewer saw themselves in Eva; consider why they sent them, and why Gainax selected them to be shown.)

### EoE: Anno's Revenge
<http://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats>

The initial reaction to EoE is bafflement. The viewer is repulsed when Shinji masturbates to a comatose Asuka. NERV staffers are butchered, non-combatants massacred. The montages are explicit and disturbing. Misato's kiss of Shinji either incestuous or pedophilia. Asuka's defeat is gory & wince-inducing. Ritsuko simply fails and is shot out of hand, the viewer deprived of any closure. (What *did* Gendo say to her?) Some scenes are simply obscene - when Eva 01 thrusts out of the giant Rei's eye, with all the eyeball-fluid spilling that implies, I simply had to look away. The rotting Rei chunks that set the background for the last scene are eery. The ending is famously inclusive; we know nothing of what will happen to Asuka & Shinji now and it's unclear what connection there is to the TV ending (which might have confused us, but the 'Congratulations!' thing at least fits some sort of ending pattern).

We might be bothered by other aspects. The occasional live-action sequence with 3 Japanese women/girls staring at us, the enigmatic dream-playground sequence (just to cite one), what's really going on - all these seem to defy a coherent analysis. Not for nothing has Eva its reputation of being a labyrinth in which fans are devoured by the minotaur of obsession.

This almost seems deliberate. Indeed, any viewer could see this, so surely the man who conceived it and executed it must see how unacceptable this all is. But he did it anyway. Why? Anno must be deliberately seeking to displease the viewer. Why? Well...

We search for a motive, and we find that the end of the TV was greeted with a firestorm. It was nothing like anyone had expected, nor did they understand what they had gotten. As the quip about academia goes, the smaller the stakes the more vicious the fights. Even better, EoE supplies a ready-made reason for Anno to want to punish viewers: shots of death threat graffiti and email ("Anno, I'll kill you!!!").

Case closed, then? Death threats are quite serious and from what I know of Japan, even rarer than in America. One could forgive a man for being disturbed and angered that his work could excite homicidal hatred.

But then, the graffiti and email weren't the only material depicted. There were a good 24 frames flashed, with about 11 or 12 different responses.

Consider letter 1. It is displayed 3 times in varying formats, and reads in part:

> I'm a middle school student like Shinji. First of all, I saw Eva and now it seems like I truly recognize myself, and this feeling is because of Eva. I want to say thank you for this. Why do I say this? To explain it would take a while, but Shinji and I are alike; depressed and helpless and introverted. I remember watching Eva and seeing Shinji being worried and troubled and I felt the same in my heart. In "EVA", there was an analysis that said how Shinji couldn't run away from the pain or the unpleasant feelings that were attached, and I have felt like this way too....
> In the last scene on TV, Shinji accepts everyone and they all congratulate him; that was a very nice end and I felt very happy....
> I'm worried about what will happen to Shinji in the movie (but I like the last scene on the TV series a lot). And thanks to EVA, I've started like myself and that has made me very happy....Mr. Anno, please keep working on EVA a lot more....and thank you so much for everything!!

Or the second letter:

> I also felt inside myself the same excitement that Shinji felt.
The last scenes made me appreciate my own existence even more.

Letter three:

> Thanks to Mr. Anno and all the staff for helping to liberate our hearts and souls, and for all of these feelings. Thank you very much.

Another letter:

> Shinji's falls into despair and Asuka's arrogance appears to be some sort of escape from the darkness in her heart. These people have difficulties in dealing with their feelings; and so in their own ways -- Shinji by totally collapsing and falling apart, and Asuka by letting her arrogance cover up her inner weakness -- they each work towards the same goal: to come to terms with themselves.

One last one:

> I could feel the pain of the TV series again. I could feel inside my heart the feelings inside Hideaki Anno's heart. So in my heart, I sympathized with "I'm not alone. To feel loneliness is better." I still feel a strange sensation even after watching the movie, because of these two opposite feelings mixing in myself. I'm waiting for the summer to see "End of Evangelion", and I know that that will be even more painful, but I will feel happy and enjoy it. I don't think that there are many people who feel this way, but in my case, EVA made me think about myself and was like a mirror of myself.

Think about what Anno chose to show. Of the many thousands of messages they must have received, he chose to show 4 times one from a depressed student like Shinji who has come to feel better about himself; another who identified with Shinji; a message of gratitude simply for the healing; some analysis of the psychological issues of the 2 most important characters; an analysis & application to himself; and some death threats.

Is it more plausible that Anno was so angered by the 2 death threats that he abandoned whatever vision he had, than that the 2 threats were chosen to be contrasts with the others?

Most of the messages were healthy responses. The writer grew or learned in some way. Eva was not mere entertainment for them.

The death threats were pathological responses; to care that much about Eva, one must be deeply attracted to it, sense that it says something about oneself. I could not care less about whether some [telenovela](!Wikipedia) series goes off the rails, because it says nothing to me; but if I were watching a series that I identified deeply with, that I felt expressed the things I valued as no series before had, and by the end, it had called my life a crippled shell, my ideals hollow and false, and urged me to become something else entirely before it was too late, something I have spent years eluding - then a equally deep sense of betrayal is to be expected. There is no apathetic response to such a challenge. Either the viewer can accept the diagnosis and strive for healing, or he can reject it utterly. A therapist is always in danger from his patient.

# Why the plot is unimportant

Let's not mince words: Eva's plot is incoherent. There is no getting around this. One of the most frequent assessments is that it is post-modern in its eclecticism, or that it is "the remix anime":
     "Evangelion carries a large number of quotes from and references to other anime productions, such as the mecha designs of Ultraman, Space Battleship Yamato, and Gundam. The works of Go Nagai – such as Mazinga Z – and even the novelist Ryu Murakami are also referred to; in particular, Devilman is seen as a major source for the overall plot. This was so apparent that Evangelion became known as "the remixed anime". pg 9 of Fujie 2004

It is comprised of hoary tropes and devices from earlier mecha and fiction in general; the subversions have been often remarked upon & considered to be what is important (eg. Napier), but even more were played straight (consider the list of identified elements by TvTropes <http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeonGenesisEvangelion> and how many of them are *not* subversions) Anno is explicit about this recycling:
    "There is no longer room for absolute originality in the field of anime, especially given that our generation was brought up on mass-produced anime. All stories and techniques inevitably bring with them a sense of déjà vu. The only avenue of expression left open to us is to produce a collage-like effect based on a sampling of existing works."  Fujie 2004
The level of recycling can be seen in comparison with another mecha series: _RahXephon_ (2002). The similarities are so numerous that anyone who has seen them both must remark on them <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RahXephon#Neon_Genesis_Evangelion> and the similarities can be traced down scene-by-scene (see <http://evaxephon.com/> ) but many of the similarities are drawing on common sources: _Megazone 23_ for the false Tokyo, _Yamato_ for the alien invasion, _Devilman_ for the cosmic conflict and vague souls and humanity's inferiority
    The overall design of Evangelion calls to mind Devilman by Go Nagai. In fact, the whole concept of the Evas, which are made from Adam, and harbor the souls of humans, can be considered borrowed from scenes from Devilman, where the soul of Akira Fudo is possessed by Amon, the Lord of War. Moreover, the heavily religious undertones, the suggestion of conflict with an indigenous people, and the cosmic view that mankind may not be the ultimate being all owe something to Devilman." pg 76 of Fujie 2004
and so on. Even an incomplete list of allusions & borrowings runs into the dozens. In this respect, Eva is reminiscent of the first Gainax videos, the [DAICON](!Wikipedia) convention videos; the videos include literally hundreds of characters and decades after their production, many remain unidentified (see one attempt to catalogue & identify them by going frame-by-frame <http://www.anime-classic.net/AC/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=DaiconWiki> )
Who could possibly appreciate such a work? Only a fellow otaku. To have not seen the relevant predecessors is to be unable to watch Eva fully. It would be like reading Shakespeare or Milton while utterly ignorant of classical history & myth. Something will come through, but how much?
Many subcultures prize works that are obscure to outsiders. Shibboleths keep the rabble out. By making Eva inscrutable to your average TV watcher, Anno speaks to the otaku alone and receives their attention. If you think Eva was popularly understandable, then why is Anno so concerned to 'dumb down', as it were, the _Rebuild_ fans?
    As the creator of this project, [I assure you that] a very new-feeling Evangelion world has been constructed. For this purpose, we are not returning to our roots at Gainax.... In closing, it is also our job to provide a service to our customers. Although it seems obvious, we aim to create a form of entertainment that anyone can look forward to; one that people who have never seen Evangelion can easily adjust to, one that can engage audiences as a movie for theatres, and one that produces a new understanding of the world. <http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies>

The subversion of tropes is not necessarily important. Many of the subversions or twists were already done. Shinji, for example, is far from the first reluctant or mentally disturbed mecha pilot - consider the pilots in _Space Runaway Ideon_, or <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamille_Bidan> in the 2nd Gundam - nor would he be the last (every other Gundam series). The important thing is that the audience knows where the creator is coming from, that quotes like "His erudition in [tokusatsu](!Wikipedia) is vast, and can be seen clearly in his animation work." are not PR fluff. That he remains one of them.
    "Primary diet consists of Sapporo Brand Barbecue Potato Chips and pizza with tomatoes as the only topping. After those comes beer. His erudition in tokusatsu is vast, and can be seen clearly in his animation work." - from the Gainax FAQ <http://www.cjas.org/~leng/daihist.htm>

The plot exists as a convenience to reach the necessary situations, and to earn otaku cred. Once the otaku have taken the bait and invested something of themselves in the series (think how hard it is to not finish a book you are half-way through), it is unnecessary, and almost abandoned by the last 2 episodes.
## The Un-Evas
We can convince ourselves further that the plot isn't important by looking at RahXephon. RX unquestionably had better animation; its music is competitive with Eva's; the critical response uniformly positive; the plot well-thought out from the beginning (with some critics specifically praising it as a "paragon of responsible storytelling (...) No loose strings are left; we see the conclusion of every character’s storyline." <http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=566> ); its Mesoamerican style quite as exotic as the Judeo-christian symbolism in Eva; its goals apocalyptic, and so on. In many respects, it is RX and not Eva which deserves to be remembered and rewatched.
And yet - it was popular enough to merit a quasi-movie & a manga adaptation, but no more. When brought up by fans, discussion often centers (just as here) on its relation to Eva. Its influence on post-2002 anime indiscernible. No revival seems to be in the cards. Why? Why does it not have a cult following, or even any mindshare? (I see online obscure series like _Texhnolyze_ recommended long before anyone dredges RX from the depths.)
Another contrast might be the later Gainax work _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ (2007). Lagann is like Eva in being a mecha series focusing on a young orphan boy piloting an extraordinarily powerful mecha, but it shuns any thinking deeper than sloganeering ("Go beyond the impossible, and kick reason to the curb!"), and is content with being a collage anime which takes all the shonen mecha tropes and pushes them to their limits. I would call it satire, but that implies some desire for change, and the series is done with such affection & good humour that it is only ever entertaining. Lagann was, of course, a massive hit among otaku. (See also later Melancholy section)
I suggest that Eva represented a peculiar & perhaps unique mix of otaku catnip and psychological '[earworms](!Wikipedia "Earworm")' - analyses that pierce an otaku's heart, that he can't forget, that he circles around and must keep coming back to again and again ("”Eva" is a story that repeats..." <http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies >). Lagann provided the catnip, unadulterated by anything else, and so is successful. RX passed on the catnip for a more artistic path, but it had no earworm, and so once gone, returned no more.

<http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/01/27/ask-john-what-does-asukas-final-line-mean/#more-628>
> In fact, I believe that this line is a direct reference to a brief scene contained only in the Japanese home video version of Evangelion TV episode 22. In this sequence that which was never broadcast on Japanese television and is not included in the American Evangelion DVDs, Asuka faces herself in the bathroom mirror and says, in translation:
> “Kimochi warui. Who wants to bathe in the same water that Misato and stupid Shinji have bathed in? Who wants to use a washing machine that Misato and stupid Shinji have washed their underwear in? Who wants to sit on a toilet that Misato and stupid Shinji have used? Who wants to breath the same air as Misato and stupid Shinji?”
> In this sequence, Asuka essentially says that she is sickened and disgusted by the idea of sharing herself with others; the knowledge that other people exist and have an effect on her. In effect, with this tremendously important sequence, Asuka reveals herself as the antithesis of Shinji and the opposite thematic pole of the Evangelion animation. Throughout the Evangelion animation Shinji is torn between his fear of human relations and companionship and his natural desire for affection, acknowledgment and acceptance. Shinji wants to belong. On the other hand, Asuka is disgusted by social relations and other people. She tries to force herself into interpersonal relationships by kissing Shinji, but even that fails. While Shinji represents the desire for companionship; Asuka represents the desire for isolation.

# Positive otakudom
## Haruhi
This theory is extensible further. One might wonder why _Haruhi_ was so extraordinarily popular when it came out. One can appeal to surface features, which exist in abundance. Haruhi is a well-designed character; her sidekicks are the epitome of moe or a fresh twist on the passive Rei archetype. The storyline is thoughtful, postmodern without being obnoxious, and often funny. The anime has a famously excellent opening, and the animation in general is top-notch. The voice actors nail their roles. The episode sequence is unique, and represents an ingenious work-around the source novels (I argue in [anime endings] that the 'Haruhi' random ordering creates a sensible dramatic arc). Kyon is himself a carefully modulated narrator, sarcastic without being negative, representing the viewer yet not too close. There was an existing fan-base from the light novels; the season had little competition. In general, everything went right. One should expect a fair degree of popularity.
But there's something missing there. When we compound our previous ingredients, the stew is insipid. What's the missing ingredient? It's the *optimism*. It's the sense of fun and wonder (the '[sensawunda](!Wikipedia "sense of wonder")'[](http://everything2.com/title/sensawunda)[](http://www.bookslut.com/science_fiction_skeptic/2007_12_012076.php) as  [A.E. Vogt](!Wikipedia) put it). The world is stranger than you imagine, but not in a despairing Lovecraftian way. The love of weirdness for its own sake, the search for novelty, these form the core of 'Haruhiism'. Haruhi's club wears its mission on its sleeve (or name, rather): "The *S*ave the world by *O*verloading it with fun: *S*uzumiya Haruhi's Brigade, abbreviated as SOS Brigade."^[Chapter 2, _[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Suzumiya_Haruhi:Volume1_Full_Text)_ (volume 1)]
This is not the usual critical otaku narrative that we saw in _Evangelion_ or in _Welcome to the N.H.K._. There, we realize the sterility of otaku pursuits. Consider dating games: the endless permutations of hair style and eye color, even the doujinshi wearily pairing off the protagonist with each girl in the standard variations of sex, the fanart putting a particular character through its paces: in a _yukata_ watching fireworks, in a bathrobe at the _onsen_, hanging out on the school roof, etc. The combinations are monstrous. Where are we to find soul or meaning in the Library of Borges?
A fan has an essentially closed universe. He has abdicated his freedom to strike off on his own in new directions. He is one of many, but still alone: the esthetic experience is still alone. He may hide his unhappiness, may throw himself into his pursuits, but he is still empty. The many critiques of modern man apply to him in double measure. He is no New Type.
This sad truth isn't always the truth. There are fans who are empowered to do new things. One thinks of the early works of Gainax, the DAICON videos. There's love in every frame of them, excitement at something new. Consider _Otaku no Video_: we can see despair in the live-action segments, particularly in the segment about the video collector. But the animated segments offer us hope: salvation through creation. The 2 protagonists are not damned by their otaku life; they overcome it to become true fans, Otakings, creators of a commercial empire, and if we take the ending literally, they helm humanity's expansion to the stars - the dream of generations.
In a way, computers were the worst thing that ever happened to otaku. They made it tremendously easy to link up with other fans and plunge deeply into multiple communities, sapping fans of the will to do anything in particular. Is it an accident that the decline of the Space Age was just before the rise of the Personal Computer Age? If we had looked forward, we would have expected computers to help us travel to Mars and beyond. After all, as the old comment goes, we went to the Moon on the equivalent of a wrist-watch; how much more could we do with modern computers! Yet we are no longer even on the Moon. The ISS is already within sight of its final orbit. We contract. We become ever more introverted. Why bother with outer space, when we have inner space? An inner space/Internet exploding in detail, becoming ever more sophisticated and addictive. If Gainax were founded today, would its animators create whole shorts multiple minutes long, or would they be doing mashups of _Lucky Star_ with _Death Note_ to put on YouTube?
Haruhi wants the SOS-dan to go out and change the world. To make it more interesting - not to make a more interesting webpage. To have fun, and search for strange beings. That we are not gods who warp the world into possessing strange beings does not make Haruhi any less inspirational. When one watches a video of _Haruhi_ fans waiting on a line spontaneously doing the dance and instantly stopping when a quizzical policeman walks by, this is the spirit of Haruhiism at work. When large red Hs appear mysteriously, this is Haruhiism too. When Improv Everywhere stages another mass event - they may never have heard of Haruhi, but that is Haruhiism too. When hackers discover some vibrators hooked up to a compass grant one a 6th sense, is this not Haruhiism too? When SpaceX launches a rocket into space - and not a social network site into an IPO - is this not Haruhiism too?

- endless eight as otaku critique? <http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9skki/what_superpopular_anime_titles_have_you_come/c0elcgj?context=3>

From the Kotaku message board from whence this post originates:

Why can’t young men wed anymore? I think it is because men can no longer say to women, ‘I can always protect you,’ in this dog-eat-dog world of restructurings and layoffs – such words are now unreal.

Women as a result now target two groups of men: “ikemen” (handsome, cool men), and rich men, the so-called ‘Hills tribe’ (referring to the ultra-prestigious Roppongi Hills residential tower).

But most men have neither money nor good looks, and as a result women will no longer consider them. Surprisingly, Ivee heard of cases where a chosen man will end up dating dozens or hundreds of women.

Since the ikemen and the rich monopolize the women, all that remains is a sterile desert, where normal men can no longer find a partner, so they flee to Akihabara and find love in the arms of an anime character.

"The question of what worked and what didn't therefore doesn't seem a pertinent one to me; to me the show is about dysfunctionality: of the artist, of his creation, and of his artistic attempts to phrase and portray that creation. If Evangelion "worked" it would be Gasaraki or Brain Powerd. Less flippantly, it might be Gundam or Getta Robo G. But what would have been the point of making them again?"

"We've seen instances, from Anno in interviews, to the pseudo-exposes of Otaku no Video, to comments by people we know, that they eventually got tired of the grinding unreality of anime, which became quite as oppressive as the grinding reality they thought to escape by becoming an otaku. The problem with that explanation for me is that I don't believe one ever escapes from reality, the challenges of existence, the issues of having been born into this world: of being a human being.
Rejecting the otaku and his works isn't going to teach you how to see, any more than the rigorous motions of otaku culture will make you go blind. Upon embarking upon his post-Eva project KareKano, Anno remarked as an epigram for the show that "reality has no mercy". He based his approach to the series in large part by talking to students in contemporary Japanese high schools: trying to restore the conversation he had cut off when he was their age."

"The complaint may certainly have some validity within Gainax itself. Anno himself foresaw this in "What Were We Trying To Make Here?", when he said, "I know my behavior was thoughtless, troublesome and arrogant. But I tried. I don't know what the result will be, because I don't know where life is taking the staff of the production. I feel that I am being irresponsible. But it's only natural that we should synchronize ourselves with the world within the production." The synch rate wasn't always 100%. Masayuki, Kazuya Tsurumaki, and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto had their own ideas; Ikuto Yamashita, the man most responsible for the distinctive mechanical designs of Evangelion, had his detailed scenario for how the story should end (it would have involved the "emergence" of the Eva units). "

"Well. I think that the world of animation is cyclic and has not evolved much for 20 years. At the time, the large madness was around Zeta Gundam, and 20 years later, Gundam is in the news and very popular. With regard to Newtype, I will say that you do not have to be concerned. As long as there will be series of popular animation, the magazine will continue to exist. However, I think that the industry rests too much on large successes like Gundam, which you could call the "Old Type," which is a little annoying with a magazine which is called Newtype. As I said earlier, the world of animation follows a regular cycle. The cover of the 10th anniversary issue was Evangelion, the cover of 20th is Gundam-- thus it is logical that the cover of the 30th will again be Evangelion. You’d better reserve it as of now."
Anno interview: <http://www.evamonkey.com/2005/06/anno-hideaki-newtype-20th-annivesary.php>


Newtype October 1998 interview <http://web.archive.org/web/20071018065110/www.cjas.org/~leng/anno-ikuhara.txt>
> [Anno] The reason the game business prospered and grew so fast is because it was a venture.  But games have finally tanked too.  It happened pretty fast, didn't it?  Our generation is naturally a shallow one, and there's no-one who's trying to overturn things.  There isn't anyone trying to make "me-anime" now, is there?
...
> [Anno] The first time I saw "Virtua Fighter"[2], I thought, is _this_ what anime is up against?  It was quite a shock.  That's when I realized I'd have to level up somewhere other than the visuals, I guess right before I did "EVA". Visual impact is anime's strong point, but since games had followed on anime's heels, it had become a time when a methodology no different from the others just wouldn't cut it.  All the cards had already been dealt, so we had no choice but to change the combination, or turn over cards that were thought to be taboo. That's what I mean when I say that "EVA" didn't use even a single new methodology.
> [Ikuhara] Ah, like what the media talks about as creatorhood when discussing animated works.  But that's just an illusion, and actually in the anime business no such thing as a creator is anywhere to be found.  All there are are people who were brought along by the founding of the system.  The people who devise the form of the anime of today.
...
> [Ikuhara] There's somewhere where we'll give up, isn't there.  We're trying to fulfill our own ambitions virtually.  I suppose if we were doing it for real we should be trying to make more properly ideal cities and better human relations. I can't really say it in anything but pedestrian terms, but, like with things like the Aum[*1] incident, I can understand the feelings of the people who want to reorganize the world. [Anno] In order to see a made-up drama, there are even people who neglect their real lives, right?  That kind of person does things like become a seiyuu fan.
> [Ikuhara] I bet what they really wanted was to touch an anime character.
> [Anno] For something that could connect the virtual and the real, I too turned to the seiyuu.  But that was a mistake.  That's why I tried to show something different in "KareKano".  But altering the existing system is tough.
...
> [Anno] Yes, a world where something is done with the body alone.  Nothing else befits a documentary.  A world that shows nothing of creation.
> [Ikuhara] Take "Utena" and "EVA".  They take a fragment of our work and talk about us introducing impact into our animation, saying it's like Terayama Shushi[12]'s work or something.  It's nothing that narrow, is it?  I think that what appears in our works is the complex about the body that people who make made-up anime feel.
> [Anno] I use the word "lifelike-ness".  Compared to that, cel anime is pretty and virtual.  Because I feel a sense of thwarted life in current cel anime, I want to try to peek at it from a slightly different direction.  Like trying not to use any of the established seiyuu.

> Postscript.  Yesterday, when I was in a state of mental collapse after my

> Asahi Newspaper publishes a weekly magazine "AERA." AERA 08/31/1998 issue dealt with an interview with Hideaki Anno.
> As you know, he is 180 cm tall. He is a kind of giant for normal Japanese.
> He always fears something. But he himself is a kind of fear.
> He was born in 1960 in Ube city, Yamaguchi Prefecture. In his childhood, Ube city has shipyards. His inside proto-landscape is like such a shipyard, say, NERV base. (Faculty of Medicine, Yamaguchi University is located at Ube city.)
> His father Takuya Anno lost his left leg like Touji Suzuhara.
> Hideaki Anno fears animal. Therefore he is a vegetarian.
> He said, "I cannot break my own heart shell. However I think I can enlarge it because I completed EVA."
> He is shy in fact.
> He made EVA as his private anime. After EVA, he escaped from work. He tried to kill himself. In order not to kill himself, he had to live at the building of GAiNAX, Musashino-city, Tokyo.
> But he lost his everything because he wasted out his all inside to make EVA.

(But did his father lose a leg? the picture of the Anno documentary, linked elsewhere, isn't clear.)

> Animage: What would you recommend?
> Anno: Shows like Yamato or Gundam (1979, TV) which have soul, emit the staff's "cry of mind" out of the screens as a certain vibration. On the other hand, I feel bad when I watch shows that are made sluggishly without such soul.
...
> Anno: Of the movies, I recommend Gundam III - Meeting in Space. The picture is quite nice. Moreover, if I have to recommend Mr. Tomino's animation, I would choose Legendary Giant IDEON (1980, TV). It would be best to watch the movie version's Part II (1982, movie) after watching the TV series. Although some of the picture quality might be poor, please tolerate it.
...
> Anno: Yes, I did, although it is a little bit light. I was just overwhelmed by its adult mood throughout the animation. I can't express such mood yet. Actually, I felt sad when I watched Nadia, which I directed, soon after watching it. I felt Nadia was too childish. (laughs)

> '"Twelve years is enough time for you to be able to look back on earlier works objectively", he explains. "Shortly before we started this project, Anno had a big Eva marathon where he watched the whole series in one go.
> The first thing he said when he finished watching was, 'This show really is interesting, isn't it? I never realized how interesting it was'. That comment really shook me."'
> 'The complexity has been somewhat lessened to make it more accessible to newbies, but it'll still take a bit of thought to understand." Otsuki adds that they're removing much of the deliberate obfuscation that made Eva infamous: "Filling works with difficult works and concepts in order to create confusion among viewers was a good technique 12 years ago, but not anymore, and one of our primary goals for this project is to turn everyone's expectations upside down."'
...
>  "Everyone was completely burned out during the second half of the original TV run and the movies, but now they're fresh and enthusiastic again. They've gotten older, but they're still full of energy. It's almost like watching kids prepare for a holiday celebration. The staff will also include a bunch of younger twenty-somethings who decided to join the anime industry after watching Eva and being inspired. " [Otsuki?]
...
> "It's true that Eva was a huge hit," Otsuki says. "But its success spawned a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding in the in the industry, the end result being a bunch of mass-produced junk. That mindset has persisted for ten years, but now we're in a position to prove it wrong. We're determined to close the door on the post-Eva era for good.

> "We got to the last two episodes and were so utterly confused, we didn't know what to make of it.  At the time I was upset with the ending, and felt cheated.
> Over the next year, I watched the series numerous times, read every explanation I could find, combed fan sites, forums, anything I could take in to understand the ending.   I don't think it was until  I spoke with Matt Greenfield at a panel at Otakon 2001 that I finally understood.  I rewatched the show, and it all made a newfound sense.  The catharsis, the introspection, it all resonated within myself.  I cannot say when it began, but it was an epiphany that would become more and more apparent and integral within myself.  I felt very much like Shinji at the very end of the series a little more each day.  My depression faded, the apathy waned, and I began to find a respect for myself.
> It seems odd to say that a "cartoon" is what helped you cope with feelings of depression and suicide, but its true.  I can not say for certain whether I would still be alive, had I not been exposed to the show.  Its a very strange notion, one I've had trouble coming to terms with myself, and one I try very hard to convey to others, but its hard when its so personal. "
<http://www.evamonkey.com/writings_clark01.php>

re: suicide; Shinji hangs out at a 'famous suicide site'? see also 'what were we trying to make', "A cowardly young man who feels that his father has abandoned him, and so he has convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person, so much so that he cannot even commit suicide."
<http://evacommentary.org/episode-04/episode-04A-scene2B.html#cut091>

"Their best original works--Yamaga's Royal Space Force, Takeshi Mori's Otaku no Video, Kazuya Tsurumaki's FLCL, and Anno's Evangelion--display Gainax's odd inside-out paradox of being super-obsessed fans who, through their meditations, nevertheless sometimes come to enlightenment about the nature of themselves, their medium, their industry, their times, and their world."

Evidence of constant retconning:
"Recent remarks by Gendo and Fuyutsuki of NERV seem intriguingly to confirm that certain details of the Angels differ in this version of events. Although the first Angel to appear, Sachiel [in Stages 1-5], had been previously assumed to be the Third Angel as so coded in the anime, it is now suggested that in this version of events it was actually the Second. Fuyutsuki commented that the Angel Sahaquiel [Stage 30]--the Tenth Angel as coded in the anime--was actually "[number] seven," to which Gendo replied, "Yes. And five remain." According to this differing classification, then, the Third Angel would be Shamshel [Stages 9-10], the Fourth, Ramiel [Stages 15-19], the Fifth, Gaghiel [Stage 20], and the Sixth, Israfel [Stage 22-26]. Note that the Angels Sandalphon and Matarael--the Eighth and Ninth respectively--have not appeared in this version of events, as they did in the anime where they followed Israfel and preceded Sahaquiel."
<http://www.evamonkey.com/writings_horn10.php>

"However, its violence and surrealism will not be new to those who have seen the TV show; neither will its view of a society of broken souls, where men and women are grains of flying sand, blasting each other to bone. Playwright Kenji Sato, who does not like Evangelion, compares it to Nine Inch Nails' album The Downward Spiral; it is an excellent comparison, and I agree, except that I like Eva. It's only a cartoon; it's only a life."
"The End's main characters are a man and a woman, Shinji and Asuka, and director Hideaki Anno when he does not present himself through Misato, Gendo, or every other character in the series identifies with them both (gossip links him romantically with Asuka's voice actress, Yuko Miyamura). As Anno explained at the outset of the series, in an essay reprinted this month in Viz's collected Book One of the Evangelion manga, he began this because he felt sick, and the final line of The End, spoken by Asuka back to Shinji, could not put things any more plain."
"This is The End of Evangelion. It is the same ending as that of the television series. It is told big-budget, stitched with bullets, limned with guts, and tagged with blood, in case it was too subtle the first time. But it is the same ending. You will see all this: a man, stunted in emotion, has a special gift within him. He can move his human hands and feet with the stride and reach of a giant. Because he knew love once, and lost it, he sketched one map on his floor where he stood and one in the sky above, until he had drawn between them a world of mysteries and wonders, a world of things to love and of those in love. But when they put their hands towards him, he drew away; when he put his hands on them, they were cold and still. In his frustration, he tightened his grip to take satisfaction by force: a load shot to nowhere, a stranglehold on beauty, clenched fists battering down his creation, until there was nothing left but himself again."

> By breaking with the long-standing tradition of basing their animated works on pre-existing stories and folk tales, GAINAX has been credited with freeing animation from the constraints which have allowed it to be perceived as a derivative medium. In so doing, they have established animated film as a self-sufficient art form (Time Magazine, November 22, 1999).

> This was part one of a four-part interview with the founding president of Gainax, Toshio Okada, conducted at Otakon '95, and should certainly be read as an alternate viewpoint to many of the events described in "The Notenki Memoirs." It ran in Animerica 4:2 through 4:5, although Okada only touches on Eva in 4:2. At the time the interview was conducted, Evangelion was in production but had not yet aired, and Okada mentions episode 5 in the context of how Gainax (since he left) has gained more control over its scheduling. He also makes the interesting assertion that he was talking about "the base story of Neon Genesis Evangelion" with Anno back when he was still at the company (he dates his departure to 1992). Hiroyuki Yamaga would later respond to some of Okada's remarks in Animerica 6:5, but not those related to Eva (I don't believe Yamaga's 1997 and 1998 Fanime remarks on Eva ever appeared in Animerica, although I think Miyako Matsuda-Graham may have covered it for Protoculture Addicts).


* 1996 "Virtual Panel! Meet Hideaki Anno," Animerica 4:9, p. 27

    (RJN writes "For Best Anno quotes (translated from a Jp Newtype), there is the Protoculture Addicts 75 or 76 IIRC, I'll check later, which covered AX96")

> This was a one-page transcript of Anno's remarks at Anime Expo '96. This is hard to imagine today, but at that point (July 1996)  the series had been over for two months, yet many American fans still hadn't seen it--not because they didn't want to, but because there was as yet no digital distribution of anime, fan or licensed--only by getting a physical copy of the tape could you watch it. This limited the speed at which an audience could grow, of course, and ADV's version was not yet on the market. Anno said a few things at the AX'96 panel that have been remembered, but what I find most interesting is "when asked about Evangelion's last two episodes, which upset many fans, Anno cooly replied, 'I have no problem with them. If there's a problem, it's all with you guys. Too bad.'" I'm not absolutely sure (it may be in my transcription notes) but I think Anno might have said "too bad" in English, presumably for emphasis.

> According to a very frank and open 40-minute interview by Anno on the NHK TV program "Top Runner" (www.nhk.org.jp/tr/) about a week or so ago, all religious and philosophical references, while providing a coherent setting for the story, were used for the specific purpose of looking cool and to make Anno & company appear intelligent.
> Anno himself called it "pedantry" (the display/parading of one's
intelligence)

> "By the way, Shinji's name came from a friend of mine.  Misato's name came from the hero of a manga.  The name Ritsuko came from a friend of mine in middle school.  I borrowed from everywhere.  Even names that have no bearing on anything actually came from the countless rules that govern these things.  It might be fun if someone with free time could research them."
"What were we trying to make here?" Anno, original manga vol 1
<http://www.evamonkey.com/writings_anno01.php>

<http://www.evaotaku.com/html/rcb-tsurumaki.html>
> -- So, "Neon Genesis Evangelion" is finally complete.
> Why did you decide to conclude the series in the form of a movie?
> KT - Yes, it's finally over.  I honestly think it would have been best simply to end it with the TV series.  Frankly speaking, I feel that everything after that was a bit of unnecessary work, although I guess normally one should feel happy about having their work made into a movie.
> -- Episode 16 made quite an impression, and seemed to mark a turning point for Evangelion.
> KT - That's because it was the first episode where the direction of drawing from the inside like that appeared.
> [Note:  Episode 16 "Shi ni itaru yamai, soshite (A Fatal Disease, and then...). Part A consisted of action scenes concerning the 12th Angel, while Part B depicted Shinji's mental and emotional struggles inside his inner universe after being trapped inside the Angel.  Mr. Tsurumaki handled the story boards, production and setting assistance for this episode.]
> -- There was a line in that dialogue -- something like, "We can't weave our lives only out of things we like...."  That line was pretty intense.  I would have thought it would strike right to the heart of anime fans, but there was almost no reaction from anyone.  (laugh)
> KT - Well, most people don't pay close attention to the dialog when watching a TV anime.  That is to say, we hear the words, but they don't enter our minds. I'm that way too.  Hideaki Anno understands this, and started to incorporate expressions that convey the message to the viewers in a more direct manner. Thus, elements which attempted to somehow convey the message within the bounds of the story gradually became fewer, and expressions which were more introspective or emotionally expressive became more frequent.
> -- I see.  Then, it's true that Shinji's feelings are Director Anno's feelings?
> KT - To tell the truth I'm not sure, but at the very least I tried to work on the project from that viewpoint.  That's why in the scenario planning sessions I was always saying something like, "Isn't that a little too hero-like for Shinji to say?  Hideaki Anno isn't that much of a hero."
> -- In episode 25' Shinji becomes completely despondent.
> Does this mean that Director Anno had also experienced that?
> KT - I think Hideaki Anno's tension after the TV series had ended had probably fallen to about that level.
> -- Looking at the flow of Shinji's emotions, I feel some dissonance when watching movie episode 25' immediately after seeing episode 24.
> KT - That may be true in terms of emotional flow.  This is because from the viewpoint of the people making the movie, work on episode 25' started almost a year after episode 24.  TV episode 25 is much more emotionally linked to episode 24.
> -- Was this cinema edition made to match Director Anno's state of mind?
> KT - I believe so.  There was a time when Hideaki Anno clearly wanted to attempt a more cathartic development.
> It didn't end up that way, but I don't think we lied.
> -- When you say "lie", do you mean to suddenly conclude with something like "love saved the world"?
> KT - Exactly.  And we didn't do that with this movie.  I feel no dissatisfaction at the ending.  I really like it.
> -- In the end, Evangelion was a story about communication -- at least judging from that last scene.
> KT - That was the intent from the start of the TV series.  That was what I tried to produce from episode 2 onward.
> -- Yes, that was the scene where Misato and Shinji talk while measuring distances from each other in Misato's apartment, right?  Although they appeared to be getting along fine with each other, Shinji was thinking, "She seems okay, but....", while Misato was thinking "I wonder if he sees through me?"
> KT - there were other scenes in episode 2 as well.  For instance, when Misato talks to Shinji but doesn't enter his room.  Even in episode 3, they are having a casual morning conversation, but are not looking at each other.  Like they looking through a slightly opened door, but not connecting.  This is the same between Shinji and Rei, and between Shinji and his father.  It's no wonder there was a lot of distant, awkward communication.
> -- Now even businessmen are debating the mysteries of "Eva" in bars.  (laugh)
> KT - (laugh)  For example, Hideaki Anno says that, "Anime fans are too introverted, and need to get out more."  Further, he should be happy that non-anime fans are watching his work, right?  But when all is said and done, Hideaki Anno's comments on "Evangelion" + "Evangelion" are that it is a message aimed at anime fans including himself, and of course, me too.  In other words, it's useless for non-anime fans to watch it.  If a person who can already live and communicate normally watches it, they won't learn anything.
> -- But, don't all the people watching "Evangelion" now actually have this type of anime-fan complex?  Doesn't everyone share some feelings of uneasiness at not being able to get along with the world.
> KT - Yes, maybe that's so.  Hideaki Anno's statements certainly are true when looking at the small circle of anime fans, but stepping back and looking at the much wider circle of Japanese people in general, we may find many of the same types of problems. They're not problems specific to just anime fans.

> Some of the jokes, gags, and elements in FLCL are subcultural, and if it was very difficult for him to explain some of the elements to the staff, it may be even more so to Americans—or so is his assumption. Tsurumaki told the Otakon panel, "Honestly speaking, I'm very happy that Americans like my work, but the Eva TV series and movies, KareKano, and FLCL are basically made for the Japanese audiences. So when I hear that they are being well received by American audiences, I feel very happy; but at the same time I feel a little awkward."
> When PULP asked him what he meant by that, Tsurumaki said, "For example, in Eva, I thought Shinji's character would only be understood by Japanese fans of this generation. But I was very happy—or actually, shocked—to find out that his kind of character is also understood by Americans." I appreciated the director's implied vote of confidence in us, but wondered whether the oft-remarked-upon Japanese sense of cultural singularism was strong enough to cancel out the universal fact of youth disaffection, let alone the worldwide reporting on incidents such as the murders at Columbine.
>Another person at Tsurumaki's press conference took up that question. Tsurumaki averred that Shinji's character was based personally on that of Hideaki Anno. Tsurumaki's version of the metaphor was that Shinji being summoned by his father to pilot the Evangelion stood for Anno being "summoned" by Gainax to direct their first anime in four years, and his in five—he traced Anno's ambiguous feelings about his craft back to Nadia. At the same time, said Tsurumaki, Anno felt, "But maybe by doing Eva I can change, I can grow."
> Most of the Gainax shows are also targeted, Tsurumaki said, for an audience "that tends to be rather weak and has problems with their family"—and the directors at Gainax are those kind of people. "A lot of families in Japan a generation ago—and perhaps even now—had fathers that were workaholics and never home. They were out of their children's' lives. My own father was like that, and I hardly ever got to associate with him until quite recently. I'm the same sort of person as Hideaki Anno. That probably influences the type of anime I create."
> Nevertheless, if Tsurumaki feels that he will never be safe, he will never be sane, he wanted to express that frantic inside in a comedic mode, rather than with the violent convulsions of Evangelion. Simply put, he personally was ready for a contrast to that apocalyptic darkness. Tsurumaki compares the bizarre robots popping forth from Naota's head to stir up the town in FLCL to the bizarre ideas popping forth from his head during its production, stirring up the post-Eva Gainax. For someone involved with such a talked-about film, Tsurumaki hardly ever watches movies himself, telling the panel he receives influences instead from Japanese TV dramas and manga, his favorite being those of Leiji Matsumoto.

Misato:” Boring kid. Your expression's blank, so unsuited to your pretty face.”
As you noted Shinji isn't into fashion and has a poor self image. Interestingly Utada Hikaru’s “Beautiful World” featured in Shinji-centric Rebuild trailers alludes to this with the recurring line:” Beautiful boy
You don't even know how beautiful you are”

"Our aim was to be the antithesis of all the giant robot animated shows around us. It's not a world where the wind blows through your hair while you declare your purpose in a booming voice. Especially in the past one or two years, this type of refractive, feminine character has not been seen."

> GAINAX, the studio that created Gunbuster, was made up of fans who really--I
mean really--knew anime. They were out to have as much fun with it as
possible, and break a few boundaries while they were at it. They were the best
anime has ever seen. Look at their short film that opened Daicon IV, following
that up with the incredible four-minute ROYAL SPACE FORCE, the film that
got them the funding for their masterpiece (and only feature film) THE WINGS OF
HONNEAMISE. With NADIA and GUNBUSTER, they demonstrated they could produce
classics in the TV and OAV genres as well. In their coda, OTAKU NO VIDEO, they
made anime's great roman a clef, closing the circle for anime fans and
exiting in style.

Leng following Toshio Okada around; fairly content free, though probably source for anecdote:
> Leiji Matsumoto, the creator of Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express 999, once proclaimed: 'If you take more than four showers a year, you can't create anything great.' Gainax founder Toshio Okada (who told this story) was shocked, but next to him, he noticed that Hideaki Anno was enthusiastically nodding and making agreement sounds. ^_^

> Mr. Anno ("Evangelion") apparently never read the Bible, despite the heavy Christian symbology of his work; he just (according to Mr. Okada) picked out a few interesting technical terms. Likewise, the anime creation staff might open a book on psychology and, rather than read it thoroughly, simply go through it picking out "great technical terms" to use in the anime!
...
> How have otaku in Japan changed in the past 20 years due to the influence of computers? Mr. Okada said that, in the past 10 years, otakus have seen less and less of a need to hide their otakuness. But more than this, the Internet helps them connect with other otakus and make friends. However, a drawback is that they no longer sit under tremendous pressure - the dual pressure of loving anime and of yet having no outlet. The dual pressure often led to the person going out and doing something, but now, the fact they have outlets means they don't have the pressure pushing them to action any more.
<http://web.archive.org/web/20080504115217/www.mit.edu/people/rei/manga-okadaluncheon.html>

> 'Evangelion' deploys otaku clichés with mechas and girls, with parodies and quotations from the history of the genre all the way back to 'Space Battleship Yamato' of 1974.(20) At the same time, Anno criticizes the closed nature of the Otaku circle, and its division into ever-smaller, strictly separated areas of interest.
> The otaku would appear to be successfully escaping the shackles of one prison named society only in order to build themselves a new housing composed of technological mediatedness and self-referentialism. As Toshio Okada writes in his book 'Our Brainwash Society' (Bokutachi no sennô shakai, Asahi Shimbunsha, Tokyo, 1995), he too detects the main problem in this closing off.

> "Masturbation is better than conventional sex," claimed Hachiro, a self-admitted virgin. "I guess I'm frightened of sex. I watch a lot of videos and read manga, and that's about as far as I want to go.
> "I don't know if it's fear so much as a matter of getting along with objects better than people," Hachiro said. "If it were possible to have sex with objects, then that would be a different matter."
<http://web.archive.org/web/20080412003814/www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.01/otaku_pr.html>

> Secondly, the job demands dedication. Mr. Leiji Matsumoto, creator of "Captain Harlock" and "Galaxy Express 999," apparently was talking with Mr. Okada and Mr. Hideaki Anno at one point, and remarked: "Any man that takes more than four baths in a year cannot do anything truly great!" The idea: a person who truly devotes himself heart and soul to a project won't have the time or inclination to bathe for months on end. But the truly shocking part of the story was that Mr. Anno, standing next to Mr. Okada, was nodding and making noises of agreement!
<http://web.archive.org/web/20080504115212/www.mit.edu/people/rei/manga-okada.html>
> "Daicon IV" was deliberately made to be the same length and cel count as "Daicon III" - however, its particular theme was slightly darker, along the lines of destroy the old to create the new. It also played with the fun of half-losing one's sanity - the semi-insanity necessary to devote oneself to anime.
> For example, an audience member happened to ask about the "GAINAX bounce," a characteristic jiggling of the female cartoon character's breasts. This was apparently introduced in "Daicon IV" by Mr. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who added in the margin of the animation instructions: "Make this scene a little erotic (H)." The animation industry reacted with shock to this animation ("Is it OK to do this kind of thing?") and of course the technique was promptly adopted by other animation houses, including Cream Lemon's porn features.
> With "Evangelion," Mr. Okada said the animators were not quite confident about it, so they ran a manga 4 months before, both to garner some popularity as well as increase the odds of funding.

Misato really did try to do Shinji in episode 23
<http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?t=445>
' it is a fact that this is a plot element that was crucial to the story as a whole, and one that Anno set us up for, right from the get-go (the picture Misato used to lure Shinji in #01: "Look at this!" [arrow points at cleavage], and, of course, in #02, "It's not like I'm going to 'put the moves' on a kid!" '
'Secondly, it's not like Misato's little self-implicating 'joke' is the only time that Anno utilizes the 'Ironic Foreshadowing' trick; there are plentiful other examples, such as Toji saying "I guess only weirdos get to be Eva pilots" . EoE is a parade of one brutally ironic pay-off after another...'
'Want an example? I asked Takeshi Honda what working under Anno was like at Katsucon 2004. He said it was very stressful because Anno made numerous last minute changes. For example, episode 24 was supposed to be about Shinji confronting Yui's presence in the Eva, not his relationship with Kaworu Nagisa.
'I was just thinking that Aaron has a good point when he reminds us not to view EVA as a perfectly thought-out work. Gainax doesn't think of its works as being perfectly thought-out--I say that because a lot of creators
think they think things out thoroughly--Gainax knows they don't. I'm reminded of a comment Toshio Okada made at Otakon 1995 about GIANT ROBO, saying that it was the kind of anime Gainax would have made, but GR's creators "do not have our confusion." '
'
EVA is suffused in sexuality, from fan-service teasing to the real thing. It was designed that way--Gainax are otaku, after all (according to Lea Hernandez, in the late 80s head of their U.S. merchandising division General Products, Gainax judged the success of GUNBUSTER by its doujinshi). But I also agree that to identify Misato as a pedophile is a little strange, if only because she doesn't seem especially oriented towards underaged men. '


> Umm... that particular checkpoint at the bottom of Newtype TV filmbook #9 p25 has a big "maybe" attached.  This is not the usual "appears" or "seems", but instead an explicit "maybe" (ka mo shirenai).
> The literal translation is:
> "Misato stretched out her hand to Shinji.  At this time she may have intended
to offer her body to comfort Shinji.  However, this was merely substitutive
behavior in order to assuage her own loneliness."

>> Part II (movies) Drama card D-88
>> Title: "Kimochi warui"
>> Small print:
>> "Shinji renounced the world where all hearts had melted into one and accepted each other unconditionally. His desire... to live with 'others' -- other hearts that would sometimes reject him, even deny him. That is why the first thing he did after coming to his senses was to place his hands around Asuka's neck. To feel the existence of an 'other'. To confirm (make sure of) rejection and denial."
> 'Although Maya looks up to Ritsuko as her "sempai", there was clearly an intention to portray Maya's feelings towards Ritsuko as something much more complicated with deliberate gay overtones. When the phantom Rei/Ritsuko embraces Ritsuko during the film, The End of Evangelion, Maya lets a gasp of "ecstasy" escape (as described by Anno).' TODO: source???

Cards are untrustworthy?
> I think some clarification is necessary for people not familiar with the card game. The double sided Hokan cards (translated as "Instrumentality Cards" in the game rules I've read) have a special goal for the player to achieve. For instance, there is a "Asuka gets Shinji" card, a "Rei gets Shinji" card, a "Shinji reconciles with Gendo" card etc. These cards and the text on them could be seen as alternate possibilities of what could happen. Like fanfiction, the text in these cards seem to give a plausible justification for each ending. With that in mind, the characterizations in these cards should be taken with a grain of salt.

> The Red Cross Book defines the Angels as:
> > Beings originated from the source of life called Lilith. They take various sizes and shapes: from a giant octahedron to a minute Angel the size of bacteria, or even a "shadow" Angel without tangible form.  Borrowing Fuyutsuki's words in episode 26', it seems that Angels are beings which got the "Fruit of Life" whereas humanity got the "Fruit of Wisdom".

note the tentativeness - 'seems'? This is the RCB, full of official Anno/Gainax input!

> I think that Mamoru Oshii (director of "Ghost in The Shell" and "Patlabor") described religious elements in anime best when he said "These are used as the prototype for the stories; not for religious reasons, but for ideology and literary inspiration".  TODO: was Oshii commenting on NGE or something else?

> In the end, Leiqunni's attempt to isolate herself from a world she regards as evil is no more productive than Shiro's initial refusal to even consider good and evil in the world (that's why I prefer to render his opening line as "I don't know if it's good or bad" although one could say "For better or worse"). HONNEAMISE is a film advocating anti-detachment.
...
> Yamaga has not merely jerked Shiro's strings to commit this act--indeed, the act derives from choice and serves to illustrate that Shiro *knows* he has a choice--Leiqunni believes *she has none.* Leiqunni believes in original sin, that "all are guilty." But if one is guilty from birth, the entire concept of "sin" as a choice becomes meaningless, for we are evil--indeed, doomed, by nature and can do nothing but ask for grace.
> But Shiro doesn't believe this is true. His prayer at the end comes only after a long string of conscious choices, actions, and decisions on his part. He prays not out of a belief that God's mercy is the only thing that can save the helplessly evil human race--on the contrary, his prayer is based on the careful observation of humanity's historical record: full of choices that led to slaughter. And yet, he simultaneously recognizes that the same human race has made it here, to "God's space"--what used to be thought of as Heaven. What he beseeches, then, is a light to mankind--"In our despair, give us one, fixed star." A beacon of *truth*--to remind us that we always have a *choice.*
> The more I look at HONNEAMISE, the more convinced I am that Yamaga knew what he was doing. The film holds with [Andre] Gide's warning: "Do not understand me too quickly." Whether the necessity for the viewer to go back again to fully comprehend it, will be a liability in its release here--I don't know--there is so much one can get from the first viewing only. But in that endurance, the viewer discovers that which endures: the art of THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE. The film is Yamaga's choice--and also, still, a light to anime--a genre that doesn't believe in itself as it should...

I knew when I saw Evangelion that Brain Powered would be called an antithesis to it, but I didn't want to change my plans any, so I just resigned myself to that.
> This is connected with my wish for more animators to see themselves as entertainers. I don't think I succeeded with Brain Powered, and I don't think it was very good with entertainment--but there was one thing I did try to do with it. If 100 people come to see an anime with giant robots, then chances are are that not every one of those 100 people will be a huge fan of robot anime. What I wanted to do was to make an anime that had a truly interesting story that wouldn't cause the people who watched it to have a nervous breakdown. I also tried to make a story that would tell anime fans that there were often other things out there better than anime. That's the goal I challenged myself to do. I don't think the series itself was a success, though, I have to admit that.
> So I was very upset when I saw Evangelion, because it was apparent to me that the people who made it weren't thinking at all about making fun for or gaining the sympathy of the audience. Instead they tried to convince the audience to admit that everybody is sick, practically in the middle of a nervous breakdown, all the time. I don't think you should show things like that to everybody. It's not entertainment for the masses--it's much more interested in admitting that we're all depressed nervous wrecks, I thought. It was a work that told people it was okay to be depressed, and it accepted the psychological state that said if you don't like the way the world works, then it's okay to just pick up a gun and attack someone. I don't think that's a real work of art. When people see that, they begin to realize they are the same way. I think that we should try to show people how to live healthier, fuller lives, to foster their identity as a part of their community, and to encourage them to work happily until they die. I can't accept any work that doesn't say that.
> Animerica: Is that different from your downbeat endings?

"Shinji, he gets summoned by his father to ride a robot, and Anno was summoned by Gainax to make a big animation show after he had had a problem with Nadia of the Mysterious Seas and didn't know if he still wanted to direct." Some fans think that the extreme violence in End of Evangelion was inspired by fans' disapproval of Anno, but Tsurumaki said that was not the case. "It wasn't a bitterness toward the fans. A lot of people think anime should always have happy endings, but that's not always the case. We wanted to educate the fans that anime can have bitter endings."

> "Why does Evangelion end violently, and somewhat unhappily?
> KT: People are accustomed to sweet, contrived, happy endings. We wanted to broaden the genre, and show people an ugly, unhappy ending.
> Why is the character of Shinji portrayed as he is?
> KT: Shinji was modeled on director Hideaki Anno. Shinji was summoned by his father to ride a robot, Anno was summoned by Gainax to direct an animation. Working on Nadia [Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water, one of Anno and Tsurumaki's earlier projects] he wondered if he still wanted to work like this. He thought that working on Eva could help him to change.
> Is there any particular reason why so many Gainax series feature very anxious, unhappy young male protagonists with no parents?
> KT: Yes, the directors at Gainax are all basically weak, insecure, bitter, young men. So are many anime fans. Many Japanese families, including my own, have workaholic fathers whose kids never get to see them. That may influence the shows I create.
> Could you explain the mecha bursting from Naota's head in FLCL?
> KT: I use a giant robot being created from the brain to represent FLCL coming from my brain. The robot ravages the town around him, and the more intensely I worked on FLCL the more I destroyed the peaceful atmosphere of Gainax.
> Why doesn't FLCL follow one story?
> KT: In the third episode Ninamori was almost a main character, a kid who, like Naota, has to act like an adult. After episode three her problem was solved so we wrote her out. She has many fans in Japan and we got plenty of letters about that decision. For FLCL I wanted to portray the entire history of Gainax, and each episode has symbols of what happened behind the scenes on each of Gainax's shows. Episode one has many elements of KareKano; episode two, a lot of Evangelion references, etc.
> Where does the title FLCL come from?
> KT: I got the idea from a CD in a music magazine with the title Fooly-Cooly. I like the idea of titles that are shortened long English words. Pok�mon for "Pocket-Monsters" for instance, and an old J-pop band called Brilliant Green that was known as "Brilly-Grilly."
> Is there any reason why the extra scenes added to Eva for the video release were cut in the first place? Did you think the story would mean something different with them intact?
> KT: The scenes that were added to Eva for its video release aren't that important. We added them as an apology for taking so long to get the video out. Maybe they'll help people understand things, because the episodes were done under tough deadlines the first time around.
> Earlier today you said that you were trying to broaden the genre by giving Eva a sad ending. Does the sameness of much of today's anime bore you?
> KT: First of all we didn't use a sad ending to annoy fans. When they're upset, that really bothers us. Personally, I think a happy ending is fine, but not if it is achieved too easily. That's no good.
> Can you explain the symbolism of the cross in Evangelion?
> KT: There are a lot of giant robot shows in Japan, and we did want our story to have a religious theme to help distinguish us. Because Christianity is an uncommon religion in Japan we thought it would be mysterious. None of the staff who worked on Eva are Christians. There is no actual Christian meaning to the show, we just thought the visual symbols of Christianity look cool. If we had known the show would get distributed in the US and Europe we might have rethought that choice.

> When I heard that EVANGELION was censored (see our article "Evangelion Controversy" on page 45), I was totally outraged. How this could be possible in our modern world? And all this (we speculated) in the name of religious belief? What about free speech? How could a legal system go along with this? Well, maybe it did not and the TV station censored the show itself to avoid offending certain sensibilities. We cannot really know where the truth lies. I was particularly confused when my friend Miyako read me Hideaki Anno's interview in NEWTYPE of June. He avoided the subject of censorship and skillfully defended his work. His point of view made sense and he made some interesting comments about the internet fans who excessively criticized the show.
> "I think the people who are very much involved with the Net," Mr. Anno said, "have very narrow views toward life and the world. They're always in their rooms and don't go out very often to communicate in person. Because of their information on the Net, they feel they know everything without searching the real truths." They easily and anonymously say things that they would never say in person. "Their messages are like graffiti in a public toilet." They attack other while they are staying in a safe place. "They don't have anything certain to hold on... that's probably why they watch anime shows. (...) I would like to add and say to those fans, hey, go out and visit towns. I am 35 now and I am realizing the importance of human contact little by little..."
> (This interview, published in the June issue of NEWTYPE, was made by Mr. Shinichiro Inoue. He encourages people to send comments and questions to Anno-san by writing to: Mr. Hideaki Anno, Monthly NEWTYPE Magazine, Kadokawa Shoten, Tokyo, 162-77, Japan.)
<http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/edito41.htm>

> "To update on the EVANGELION controversy, nothing really came out from Anno-san at Anime Expo. He seemed embittered, and quickly lost patience with the fans. "If you don't understand, it is your problem", he said! He made many comments in such terms that our reporter on location couldn't put them on paper. For more details, check our report on Anime Expo in the next issue. Anyway, someone who worked on EVANGELION did confirm that the last episodes (from 19 and on, but mainly 25-26) were censored following pressure from the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association; but no mention of any legal action) and that they had been botched.

'Hideaki Anno Talks to Kids'
> In 1997, shortly after the success of Evangelion and somewhere during pre-production of Kare Kano, Anno participated in a popular NHK show called "Welcome Back for an Extracurricular Lesson, Sempai!", where popular personalities revisit the town they grew up in to teach a class at their old primary schools. For anyone who has peeked into the very, very dark current of thought he vented so readily in Evangelion, the thought of this is impossible not to snicker at.
...
> Before Anno arrives, they are to draw and write what they think he's like, based on their thoughts from watching Eva. Puzzled, they just start coming up with silliness.
...
> "Why is that robot-thingy called Evangelion?"
> "It comes from a Christian word meaning 'Gospel' and it's supposed to bring blessings. It has has some Greek roots. I chose the name because it sounds complicated."
> "What does Rei like?" Otaku boy asks. "I haven't thought about it," is Anno's curt reply. He's not exactly a verbal person, but he's keenly aware of subtle things that affect how the kids might react to him, so he does things like maintain eye level with them. Anno admits he has a self-esteem problem. "I'm not crazy about myself. I'm often told that those who don't like themselves have high ideals, but I think someone who says that doesn't really understand the pain that's involved," he muses.
> "Do you like the anime you make?"
> "There's parts I like and parts I don't."
> "What parts do you dislike?"
> "The parts that I'm in."
...
> After a quick school lunch (Anno barely eats, and refuses all meat and fish) The kids are brought by bus into town to interview Anno's parents and childhood friends. [cf. the '96 anime panel]
...
> After the kids present their (much improved) animations, Anno wraps up by explaining the point of such free-form exercises. "In school tests, there's only one answer for each question, and you might get zero or half points if you're wrong. But in the real world, things aren't so black and white, so think about things on your own and express them in words or pictures. That's how you communicate with people. That's so important."
...
> The power lines, the landscapes of man-made structures -- including many of Anno's visual trademark shots -- are so obviously influenced by these surroundings that we almost expect to see Asuka rounding the corner.

It's only a cartoon; it's only a life."... TODO: Sato's full remarks

Evangelion design by mecha designer Ikuto Yamashita
>  "So why did Evangelion wind up with that shape?" I figure that from now on I will hear that question countless times. The director instructed me to make, "the image of a demon." A giant just barely under the control of mankind. I get the feeling I've seen that correlation before... The image I had for the design concept was the fairy tale, Gulliver's Travels. Enormous Power Restrained.

> Anno, as late as the November '96 issue of Newtype magazine, still denied that the last two episodes were a "lousy job" and argued that the Gainax crew worked incredibly hard to finish the series, which he thinks "ended beautifully." He regretted that fans cannot appreciate Gainax's efforts.
> Asked about the violence and uncharacteristic sex scene in episodes 18 and 19, Anno said that the scenes were necessary to develop the story and "to understand real life." He felt that children should be exposed early to the realities of life so that they do not grow up weak and sheltered and so that they will become immune to some of the harsh situations they will eventually experience. Many fans at the convention thought that this was an interesting viewpoint on his part.
> Do you wonder why Eva got so dark and psychological near the end? After all, Anno is the guy who directed Nadia of the Mysterious Seas, one of the liveliest and funniest anime I've ever watched. According to Anno, from episode 16 on, he began reading books about human psychology and became very interested. He wanted to explore "what the human mind is all about inside."
> "I wrote about myself. My friend lent me a book on psychological illness and this gave me a shock, as if I finally found what I needed to say," he says in the November Newtype.

In other words, we're offering viewers to think by themselves, so that each person can imagine his/her own world. We will never offer the answers, even in the theatrical version. As for many Evangelion viewers, they may expect us to provide the 'all-about Eva' manuals, but there is no such thing. Don't expect to get answers by someone. Don't expect to be catered to all the time. We all have to find our own answers." -PA #43, translated by Miyako Graham from 11/96 Newtype

> OKADA: I had a lot of fun making making GUNBUSTER, but I didn't have that burning sensation when I made OTAKU NO VIDEO. It was something that I lightly made. I made it that way because I thought the people who watched it were like the people in the live-action portion--not the people who made it. 1983 was the turning point for myself and my friends. Basically what I wanted to do was set the stage for 1983 because that was when everything was changing; I wanted to show people what it was like during that period back in 1983, how we lived, basically, what our life was as otaku.
> PANEL: I'd like one more question, and then I'm going to open it up to everybody: There are many themes...I go back to OTAKU NO VIDEO--you talk a lot about, and it seems like you predicted in that film, a lot of the commercialization and product management that is now very, very common in the animation industry. Do you feel more strongly now about the way things have to be processed, and managed, and shoved out the door--you see all around you the selling of creativity?
> OKADA: That world we made in OTAKU NO VIDEO, it was not a prediction: it was an otaku's dream. Maybe we can be more major, or a bigger group, or maybe we can make our own theme parks! But in these days, I can't believe all of the things that are happening--our otaku's dreams are beginning to become a reality in the United States. I am very surprised, and very glad.

> AUDIENCE: Many Americans believe the line Kubo [OTAKU NO VIDEO] has concerning wanting to become the tyrannical king to be a reference to Nostradamus. We were wondering if it really is, and if Gainax was into other forms of Western occultism, like Masonry, or the Knights of Malta.
> OKADA: No, no! (waves dismissively at audience).
> PANEL: [TO AUDIENCE MEMBER] You're a bad boy!
> OKADA: The setting of 1983 is still the primary focus of OTAKU NO VIDEO, and the characters in that video during the time had seen the movie, NOSTRADAMUS: THE MAN WHO SAW THE FUTURE [narrated by Orson Welles-*ed.*]. Anyway, what it was, is that, their idea--that vision was so strong in their minds that they presented that story. And what I wanted to do was for people to see it, and make that, and say, "Oh, there are still people like this!" or, "Yes, that was the way it was back then."

> AUDIENCE: O.K....Do you feel it is easier for social outcasts to be creative, to invent original ideas?
> OKADA: That's right. Basically, creativity will not come out of happy lives, but from people who become outcasts. There is no reason for you to become *purposely* unhappy. 'Cause everybody who watches anime is happy--the people who watch it who are *not* happy, are the people who make it [LAUGHS]. It's not too good of a thing to make anime. I think a peaceful life is to take anime merchandise cheap from Japan, and then sell it expensively over here and/or work at Viz and make some weird American anime magazine. Very happy! [LAUGHS]

> OKADA: In THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE's story, that planet is six light years from our Earth. So, I told Mr. Yamaga, we should make a continuation story where their spaceship, not interplanetary, but interstellar, arrives here 100 years after the time of HONNEAMISE. So, they come to our Earth, and make contact with Earth. So, it is a continuity of that story. But it is very difficult to make. The plot I want to have, if I am to make a continuation of THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE, is to have the story of them making their own interstellar ship, And that ship will arrive in our solar system right about the time Earth is able to colonize Mars. Not a warp drive, but an acceleration ship.

> OKADA: Right now, he's an executive at Bandai Visual. And he still has a religion: he believes in Mamoru Oshii, just like Jesus Christ [PRAYS TO HEAVEN]. In those days, in 1983 or 1984, he asked of everything to Mr. Oshii: "Is it good, or is it bad?" And if Mr. Oshii said, "Oh, it's good!," so Mr. Watanabe would think, "Oh, it's good, it's good, I must make it, I must make it!" And then I told Mr. Watanabe, "I want to make this film, THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE," and he thinks, "I think it's a good idea, but I can't decide if it's *really* good. So--just a moment, I must go to Mr. Oshii's house" [RUNS IN PLACE; LAUGHS]. And Mr. Oshii says, "Oh-- it's interesting!" So, he thought, "It's good, it's good, it's good!" [LAUGHS] And it's a very powerful motivation for him, inside. So, he works very hard, and gets a very large budget for our film from the president of Bandai. So Mr. Oshii, he is a very good person for me, or for Studio Gainax, but...but...it is very strange to say, "Maybe it is good, but maybe it is not so good." It was a religion. But just now, Mr. Watanabe, he's come out of his brainwashing. So, he sometimes says: "Maybe...maybe, *maybe*, Mr. Oshii is sometimes wrong." [LAUGHS]
<http://web.archive.org/web/20001217151500/www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking7.html>

> OKADA: Not so. It's almost the same, from what I said to you at Otakon. You must remember that EVANGELION is produced at Tatsunoko, so the schedule is out of the control of Gainax--it's the responsibility of Tatsunoko. Tatsunoko almost rules, when it comes to control. So, I think, the responsibility was not with Gainax. People say, "It's the responsibility of Mr. Anno," but they're wrong. Control over schedule is the responsibility of the producer. But Tatsunoko and T.V. Tokyo couldn't handle it. It was out of Gainax's control.
> AUDIENCE: I talked to a person from Tatsunoko. He said he does does not blame Mr. Anno, but he blames other people at Gainax, who might be telling Anno about his schedule, and--
> OKADA: Oh! I think producers always say that. But I talked with Mr. Anno about this a month ago, and then he said, "I'm *almost* the producer of EVANGELION, but I must be so, because Tatsunoko did not do anything for EVANGELION." See, he is very disappointed with Tatsunoko, and some rumors have said that Tatsunoko lost the film, or cels before they were shot.
> AUDIENCE: Wow!
> OKADA: And I asked Mr. Anno, "Is it the truth?" And he says, in a dark voice, "Yes."
> AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.
> OKADA: But that was in the middle of the episodes. That wasn't the trouble with the last two episodes, the confusion. It was just Mr. Anno's teleplay. He said to me, "I can make a schedule on my own." At that time, I heard from Mr. Anno about his new plans, so maybe you want to--?
> AUDIENCE: Of course.
> OKADA: After EVANGELION, his next plan is to make a STAR TREK. Not *that* STAR TREK--a sort of anime like STAR TREK, a crew in a spaceship, who go to every planet, and each planet has its own culture. For example, one planet will have a very democratic culture, and everyone will approve, so they'll board, or they say, "no," and they talk with the crew about everything. And the spaceship crew will sometimes fall in love in some way on the planet, or something will happen--*maybe* some robots fight [LAUGHS]. He wants to make that film, because Mr. Anno thinks it will be a very good experience for the Japanese animation world. But the sponsor says, "It's not so good,"
<http://web.archive.org/web/20001217163000/www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking8.html>

> OKADA: Right now, I think there's more than fifty people who work at Gainax. Most of these people work on making computer games, and half of them work on making CD-ROMs, such as the CD-ROM featuring Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's artwork. And there's maybe only two or three people who work on anime. The anime part of Gainax, I think, is Mr. Anno and Mr. Suzuki, and one other person. So, the animation department is very, very small. Most of the people in Gainax just now work on artwork CD-ROMs. When they make anime, they must join forces with another studio. It's a bad case of a company that's grown larger and larger--they have to make a lot of money every year, every month, so they have to make and sell a lot of CD-ROMs, because animation *loses* money. The case of EVANGELION, where they're actually *making* money, is something of a miracle, in the opinion of Gainax executives such as Hiroyuki Yamaga and Mr. Sadamoto, and not something they can expect as normal. They want to keep on making anime, but since it's unprofitable, they must make more CD-ROMs and computer games to balance things out. And so the computer game department gets larger and larger, and the animation department gets smaller and smaller. It's not good.
<http://web.archive.org/web/20001217173900/www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking9.html>

> OKADA: I think the style, or mood, of EVANGELION, is not so far, not so different, from the serious side of GUNBUSTER or NADIA. The biggest difference would have been in the style of planning the last episode. My style is to always plan the ending *first,* as I did with GUNBUSTER--everything then follows from that. In NADIA, Mr. Anno couldn't decide on the ending--it wasn't fixed until only three months before the final episode was shown. So subsequently, I was confused about NADIA, and there was a lack of control over the various episodes. EVANGELION is a very great series--I think it's one of the top anime ever made. But--the last scenes were never fixed. When I talked to Mr. Anno a month ago, he said he couldn't decide the ending until the time came. That's his style. So, if I had made EVANGELION with him, I couldn't do such a thing. I'd think I'd have to fix the ending, what would happen with every character. Then, everything would follow: the first episode, the second episode...If I wanted to show a boy's coming-of-age story, a *bildungsroman,* the last scene would show the grown-up man; the first scene, a boy who hates everything about the adult world. That would be the structure; I'm very careful about a regular construction. But Mr. Anno's style on EVANGELION was not so. He wants to put it together episode-by-episode. It's just like the style of a manga. In your typical manga, the artist doesn't have any picture of the last scene, or the last episode. They just think of building up on past episodes. And finally, the manga artist, and his assistants, and editor...[BURIES HEAD IN HANDS], they work out an idea about the last sequence. If it's a good idea, the whole episode is very good. If they can't make a good idea, the whole episode is not so good. It's an unhappy story. And I think that's what happened with the last two episodes of EVANGELION. Mr. Anno and his staff couldn't make a good idea for it. He told an anime magazine in Japan that he couldn't make what he wanted because of schedule or budget. But that's not correct. I talked with Mr. Yamaga and Mr. Anno. They said, "It's not only a problem of schedule or budget. It's a problem of what the ending is going to be." Mr. Anno couldn't decide. Mr. Anno's and my own style of production are very different.
...
> Because many anime and *seiyuu* magazines are asking Mr. Anno that question, and every time his answer changes. It's "confused, confuse-er, confuse-est." He's not happy right now. Maybe you know that back in January, or February, he shaved his head. It's a Japanese gesture of contrition. People said, "Oh, he's feeling a lot of responsibility towards the producer, or T.V. Tokyo, or the sponsor." Not so. He felt a very strong responsibility about *his* stuff. "Sorry, I can't do it!" So he shaved his head. This summer, he hates anime fans. I think he'll feel happier by autumn.
<http://web.archive.org/web/20001217044400/www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking10.html>

> OKADA: Yeah, maybe that's right. Right now, many anime fans in Japan are fighting each other over whether that ending was good or bad. Some say, "Anno must feel no obligation towards the fans--he must make something true to himself." Many fans are fighting over this. Your question has come up in these debates. In my personal opinion, if he wanted to make such a statement, to say, "this is just fiction, and you should go back to the real world," he could do it a better way. If that's what he wanted to say, it's not necessary to make an anime to do it. But he's still an animator, and he wants to make another anime series. So his true mind does not say, "it's only animation, and I should go back to the real world." So I think Mr. Anno's confused just now.

> Toshio Okada on old-school, hundred-proof  "Otaku 1.0" from the Eighties: "individuals who chose to pursue childish hobbies as a means to intellectually and emotionally isolate themselves from society."
> Toshio Okada on the current generation of otaku: "a growing ghetto of weak individuals who blame society when others fail to understand their personal interests."
> Toshio Okada on himself: "I'm done."
...
> He portrays the rise and fall of Japan's otaku in three stages. The first generation are called "otaku aristocrats" -- early adopters from the late Seventies and early Eighties who felt the need to proselytize and convert their friends to the lifestyle. This sense of noblesse oblige eventually gave rise to the second generation of "otaku elite" from the late Eighties through the late Nineties, who spurned and scorned anyone without the good sense to share their taste in entertainment. And finally, this self-centered attitude reached its apex in the current generation of "moé-otaku," purveyors and consumers of anime, comics, and video games that feature infantile female characters instead of plotlines.
> Okada defines the otaku crowd he grew up with as a group of "individuals who chose to pursue childish hobbies as a means to emotionally and intellectually isolate themselves from society," defending their behavior as a form of rebellion and empowerment. According to Okada, this early generation of otaku weren't outcasts but rather noble outsiders, individuals who were more than willing to face public scorn rather than give up the things that were important to them. Essentially discriminated against by society at large, they had no choice but to circle their wagons and wall themselves off from it, like native Americans (yes, that is his parallel) forming reservations in an attempt to preserve their way of life. In other words, it wasn't a hobby, it was an cultural group, a tribe
...
> In contrast, Okada takes the current generation of otaku to task for continuing to "ghettoize" themselves, retreating ever-deeper into individual virtual worlds when they encounter any sort of resistance to their interests. Where's the sense of pride, of camaraderie? he wonders. He decries their inward focus, their passivity, their apparent lack of desire to learn about or interact with subcultures outside of their own tiny worldviews. (The last is a hallmark difference, at least in Okada's idealized view, between the moe-otaku and traditional old-school otaku, who actually forced themselves to partake of genres or titles they didn't particularly like in order to broaden their horizons.)
...
> In the end analysis, Okada's swansong is as much about the collapse of Japan's bubble era (which fueled the super-consumerism that allowed the otaku to flourish) as it is about the collapse of a subculture. Whether you consider him an astute analyst or a sentimental relic pining for times long gone by, there's no question that Okada played a key role in articulating the subtleties of otaku culture to the outside world. Now that he's officially declared Otaku 1.0 dead and buried, who will speak to the secret lives of their modern counterparts?
<http://altjapan.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/07/already-dead.html>


> I just don't get these ero-ge playing, gashapon-collecting, cosplaying, maid-cafe-patronizing kids anymore, they say. The Internet has made it so easy to zero in on others with your own interests that we've raised a generation of nerds mired in their own tiny spheres of influence. Fans of a given genre use information technologies to surround themselves with like-minded people in impenetrable cliques. The thought of a broader society beyond their own tiny subculture never occurs to them. Call it the "otaku singularity" worldview.
> It wasn't like this back in the golden age, they continue, thumping their glasses of shochu on the countertop for emphasis. Otaku of different stripes hung out together (thunk)! There was an exchange of ideas (thunk)! The military otaku and PC otaku and anime otaku and Gun-pla otaku all shared ideas, created things they wouldn't have been able to do on their own. It was like... like... an otaku utopia!
...
> Not having lived in Japan during the "Otaku 1.0" era (late '70s - late '80s), it's tough for me to tell how much of this idyllic "cross-pollination" really happened on a regular basis. But it's a seductive image and one mirrored in Okada's autobiographical film Otaku no Video, in which a house full of freaks with wildly different interests pools their talents to launch their own company.

> The song Komm Susser Todd (German for "Come Sweet Death") used for the film, The End of Evangelion: Episode 26' - Sincerely Yours, is an English translation of Director Hideaki Anno's original Japanese lyrics.
<http://www.evaotaku.com/omake/Komm.html>


> "Evangelion is my life and I have put everything I know into this work. This is my entire life. My life itself."
Hideaki Anno (translation from 11/96 Newtype in Protoculture Addicts #43)
<http://www.evaotaku.com/omake/anno.html>

> The cult anime named Evangelion. A forbidden anime about how a group led by morally/spiritually bankrupt individuals uses an autistic boy to wage pitched battles against incomprehensible creatures, and how through contact with the hearts of a mentally fragile, bandaged girl and an overly self-conscious, traumatized girl, that boy ultimately attains deliverance/salvation himself in the final episode. Some viewers became enraged, some despondent, some lost friends as a result of hysterical disputes, and some attained deliverance/salvation themselves.
...
> If memory serves correctly, when the plan arose they made up to Ep6 (despite Anno apparently saying in Quick Japan magazine that they had "made up to Ep7 in advance") and sent out feelers in all directions, but were given the cold shoulder by every company. (laugh) Even Bandai snubbed them based on the past results of the huge failure of "Wings of Honneamise (Royal Space Force)". (laugh) They had connections with a TV Tokyo producer, but if you can't get sponsors it doesn't matter. So after wandering lost by the wayside for a bit, Kadokawa Shoten finally picked them up. But the truth is that even Kadokawa just barely picked them up, and flatly rejected their budget requests, saying that they only intended to budget the same level and not a yen more than other anime Kadokawa had sponsored in the past (Tenchi Muyo, etc.).
...
> Anno himself also replied in an interview that, "We completely ran out of time partway through...." However, the direct cause was not the PTA or a lack of time, but the more pressing issue of "budget".
...
> ...finally moving his heavy arse, Anno vastly restructured the production system. First, 75% or more of the production staff from Ep16 onward were outsourced South Korean staff. In terms of the animation as well, when reusing sequences other than bank sequences or for still shots, instead of using the film, these sequences were instead dubbed in at the end using a video deck. This is why character close-ups and other shots that seemed to jiggle increased partway through the series. They even mixed stupid photographs and other stuff into the mental image scenes. In the worst cases some scenes just showed a still screen that lasted for a minute or more. But no matter how much they struggled, they had already exceeded their budget and time limits. And then to top it all off were those last two episodes.
> Although budget issues were the main problem, Gainax had also quarreled constantly with TV Tokyo since before the TV airing over moral issues such as how the show would end and other details. These ranged from trivial points such as it being improper to show women's underwear in the hanging laundry, to major items such as the brutal scene at the end of Ep18 "The Choice of Life". It's kind of letting the cat out of the bag now, but the truth is that "Asuka dies from madness (she lives in the TV version)," "Shinji dissolves but reforms," and "Rei also dies" were already determined before the TV airing started, and Gainax had quarreled a number of times with the TV Tokyo producer and related parties over these plot devices. Furthermore, the ending was supposed to have been "The main characters die one after another, and the final battle is Ikari Shinji vs. Ikari Gendo," although there probably isn't any evidence left to support that now. (laugh) Well, except it seems that Hayashibara Megumi (voice actress for Ayanami Rei) said on a radio program something like: "I might end up fighting against Shinji." I also heard talk that "Misato and Ritsuko both die fighting each other, and Misato's death awakens Shinji(?)" Surprisingly, it seems the character who was the key to the climax was not Rei, but Misato. But then I guess it doesn't matter what is said now. (laugh)
...
> When Ep20 aired, complaints poured in from the PTA. This infuriated TV Tokyo all the way up to the upper management, which made it impossible for Gainax to take any bold measures. Nowadays it's pretty much taken for granted that the only people who complain over every little thing in children's TV anime or manga are people like Kofuku-no-Kagaku* pulling a publicity stunt for their "evil book banning movement".... Still, at that point the TV Tokyo upper management issued the severe notice that "Any anime that is deluged with complaints from the PTA even once from now on will be canceled regardless of the reason." The anime "Bakuretsu Hunters" and "Fushigi Yugi" were airing on the same channel at the time, and these also caught flak and received strict warnings even though they had not done anything. (laugh) That's why there were so many unnatural changes in the story contents from Ep20 onward.
> So for these reasons, the Eva [TV] ending was made under conditions with Gainax's hands tied in terms of budget, time and content. Considering that the last two episodes were made under those conditions, Director Anno might even be viewed as amazing.... Nope, I just can't view him like that. (laugh) After all it was his own damn fault that things turned out that way.
...
> Anno said in some anime magazine that “Katsuragi Misato is modeled in part on my first love,” but do you know who he was talking about? It’s Hidaka Noriko, the voice actress for Jean in “Nadia and the Secret of Blue Water”. (laugh) When the TV version of “Nadia” launched, Anno confessed his feelings to Hidaka Noriko. This is a famous story in the industry. Apparently Anno told her that he “looked at her not as an object of adoration/longing, but as a serious love interest!” (ROTFL!) Apparently he was even seriously thinking of marriage.However, Hidaka Noriko refused him flatly, saying “I have no intention of marrying someone in the anime industry.” Wait, what? Don’t we know now that she was married to some anime-related producer at the time? (ROTFL!) But Anno would not give up, and told her, “Well, watch my next work, and then decide!” In other words Anno was proposing an affair to the already married Hidaka Noriko. (laugh) Anyway, Anno next work was “Evangelion”, so... Evangelion might be considered a work that embodies something of a stalker obsession.
...
> But it looks like there is no shortage of people willing to get paid and become famous for writing magazine articles on the subject. Isn’t that right? Okada-san? Takekuma-san? Otsuki Kenji-san? (ROTFL!)

Carl Horn's criticism of the above kaibunsho

> Taking him to the airport after Fanime one year, I asked Hiroyuki Yamaga about Anno and Miyamura, whether it was true they were going out (which was the story I had heard--not the story that she rebuffed him). If you've ever seen THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO, he was kind of reclining back in the car seat at the time like Jigen was, just before they blew the tire. He sort of gave a "where'd you hear *that*?" response. Mr. Yamaga is usually not shy about gossiping about Anno, which leads me to believe either 1.) they were never going out (90% possibility) or 2.) they were but jealousy forebade him from confirming it (10% possibility).
...
> It's quite possible that this struggle was interpreted instead as a struggle with Anno, which certainly made for juicier rumors. Nor was it all that far-fetched, as there was at times a great deal of tension within Gainax over the making of EVA.
> Anno was also at one time romantically linked with Ayako Fujitani, whose novel "Shikijitsu" he, of course, adapted into film. They apparently first met when she was starring in the remakes of the GAMERA series (Yamaga claimed at one time the real reason Anno walked away from KARE KANO was because he was too busy editing his "making of GAMERA" documentary). Ms. Fujitani is, of course, also the daughter of Steven Seagal, making the rumored relationship not without great personal risk.

Shinji/Asuka mirroring

> Bryan was taking some video of the people walking by as a snapshot of everyday people. Because it was Saturday afternoon, some of the people traveling through the station were school students returning home after a half-day at school. Of course, they were wearing uniforms of the style we learned to expect in anime. Although it may appear obvious and natural to some of you, my impression of everything we saw in Japan that matched what I had seen in anime was changing my impression of the country and its culture. What I came to realize is how accurately anime portrays many elements of Japanese culture. This means that I had to reevaluate the impression of Japan that anime had given me, and look more closely at what I had previously not considered accurate portrayals of everyday life: the sound crows make, the layout of city streets and railways, the hustle and bustle of daily life at a train station, the zoning laws, what people wear, what they look like, how they color their hair (^_^), what they eat for breakfast, the size and thickness of one slice of bread (^_^), and so on.
...
> Note: I'm not absolutely certain these are the reasons, nor are they necessarily the sole reasons, for Anno's departure from the production of Kare-Kano.
> Anno objected to the restrictions placed on TV anime by TV Tokyo after the Pocket Monster incident, so in protest, he decided to have nothing more to do with TV Tokyo and left the production of Kare-Kano in the hands of Sato, who joined Gainax after having worked for the government in a public works management position.

Cut live-action Asuka scene; covers 2 unused EoE endings:
>         Last A

>         You already know the beginning of this one (a beach, petrified headless > Evas, etc).
>         Thew, we see the graves Shinji made (it's stated by Anno it was _he_ who > made them). The names of all main Eva characters are written on them, except for > "Ayanami Rei".
>         We then see Asuka's grave.
>         And Asuka's foot kicking it to the ground. ^^;
>         (you can still see these graves in the actual ending... no names, but > there is Misato's pendant nailed on one of them, and an other has been kicked > down ^^ )
>         We then see Shinji and Asuka on the beach... and you know that scene, > too (but this draft demonstrates that Shinji and Asuka didn't just wake up there > after Third Impact... they've been living here for some times... meaning they > _could_ be the two only humans willing to return, after all... ^^; )
>         When Shinji starts crying, Asuka was supposed to say something like > "Idiot. No way I'll let you kill me" ("idiot" was removed in the storyboards... > and the whole line was modified, eventually).

>         Then, the ending music (so, there was one... ^^ ) was supposed to begin, > and the staff credits were to appear (Anno suggests a horizontal scrolling, like > in GunBuster, I guess).
>         We were to see Eva-01 lying on the Moon, and woman's hair showing from > its broken mask (but her face remains unseen).
>         Behind Eva-01, you could see Earth, entirely red.
>         And the Black Moon, destroyed.
>         The camera goes to the sun, then to the stars.
>         Credits end.
>         "Shûgeki" ("the end").

> Now the true ending is based upon Last A. Last B is slightly different.

>         Last B

>         It begins like the previous one, but Asuka doesn't show up in the > "graves scene".
>         We then see Shinji lying on the beach.
>         His right hand is holding a white one.
>         "I'll never see them again."
>         "It's better to think of it this way."
>         "I'm still alive, so I'll keep on living."
>         He squeezes the hand harder.
>         Then, he sees Rei (like in the actual episode and Last A).
>         We eventually see that there is nobody lying near Shinji. Just a white > arm without the rest of the body.
>         The camera then shows the full moon.
>         The ending credits are the same as in Last A.

Olivier's defense of the accuracy of these endings/materials: <http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/2001-March/039253.html>

Gainax initially proposed EVANGELION: REBIRTH 2 as the title
<http://www.ex.org/2.4/11-news.HTML>

> The tentative title for episode 26, in the first drafts of the overall story, was "Tatta Hitotsu no, Saeta Yarikata". "Tatta Hitotsu no Saeta Yarikata" is the Japanese title of "the Only Neat Thing to Do" by James Tiptree Jr.
<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/2001-March/039361.html>

> 'Alice Sheldon, writing as James Tiptree Jr., wrote a clear lineal descendant of "The Cold Equations," called "The Only Neat Thing to Do", (not available online) in 1985. The 1950s had made way for the 1980s and in this story the young female protagonist makes the decision for herself. The situation is somewhat different; she is alone in a spaceship with a parasitical alien that could be a danger to her world if she returns, so she does the "only neat thing" by heading outward forever, in effect committing suicide by eventual diminution of resources. As Godwin did, Tiptree stacked the deck to make only one neat thing available to her protagonist.'

Gainax uninvolved in ADV translations?
<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/2001-October/040552.html>

> [Yutaka] Izubuchi drew some design proposals on the Evangelions. Anno sent him instructions and rough sketches, and Izubuchi drew some designs. Izubuchi introduced one with four eyes like what unit 02 ended up having. We don't know how much his proposal influenced the final design though, since he's not credited for the final designs.
...
> I'd always thought Izubuchi had influenced the mecha (for lack of a better term) designs in Eva; there's a good deal of resemblance between the Eva-01 and Izubuchi's Kaempfer design from Gundam 0080, particularly around the head. Nice to see that there is actually some proof to back me up on this.

> In fact, I don't think I'm reading anything about religion into Evangelion, so much as simply pointing out what the series already contains in this scene, and that scene, and...If Gainax was really concerned about people misinterpreting the religious elements in Eva after the TV series aired, they had a strange way of showing it when they made EoE, because the film ratchets these things up tremendously.
> In fact, an interesting way of describing the difference between the TV and the film ending is that the TV ending not only lacks the action and apocalypse, it also lacks the religious tone and iconography of EoE. Certainly Evangelion can be viewed as a psychological analysis, but I would argue from that perspective, the TV ending is the more "relevant" one, because it relies more or less entirely on human discussion, reflection, and analysis, rather than apocalyptic spectacle.

> As a matter of fact, Anno is a student of Leni Riefenstahl, and parodied her Triumph of the Will in the Nadia omake. In the spring 1997 issue of Tokion he said regarding the dangerous potential of art: "Nazi Germany was a perfect example. Those guys were making great movies! Even the anti-Nazi propaganda films Disney produced, portrayed Nazis as being fashionable" (He also said of Evangelion in that same interview, "I'm obviously not from a Christian upbringing, so they will have to excuse me for borrowing certain Christian words and images." He didn't say, "They will have to ignore my borrowing them, because they have no meaning whatsoever within the story").

> > YAMAGA: I don’t know exactly why. I suspect that Mr. Anno may have read some book on it, and there was some thoughts he wanted to express on it. I personally am glad that, rather than Christianity, he didn't express some obscure Buddhist theme, because then it would have been linked more with Aum Shinri Kyo. [LAUGHS]

> > YAMAGA: As far as Mr. Anno committing suicide or anything like that [LAUGHS], I’m not really sure how to say this, but, while sometimes he might seem very emotional, when you get to know him, he doesn't come off like that at all. [LAUGHS] As far as David Lynch is concerned, I don’t dislike David Lynch, but on the other hand, he’s not someone I’m a huge fan of, either. As far as Anno, there have been people who have called Evangelion the anime equivalent of Twin Peaks. [LAUGHS]
<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2006-September/003693.html>

> None of the Evangelion production staff are themselves of a Western religious background. Tsurumaki, for his own part as assistant director, said at Otakon that he always envisioned the extensive use of Judeo-Christian iconography in Evangelion to be more of a way for the show to distinguish itself visually in the mecha field. Evangelion's eschatology is in fact too well-developed to be regarded as a mere motif, however if it is a syncretic, symbolic and esoteric approach, it is not an ignorant one. Tsurumaki remarked that Eva, being a show only meant for Japan, allowed Gainax to creative freedom in the use of Western elements, removing any concern about how their interpretation might cause offense. By the same token, Yamaga has expressed a sense of relief that Gainax couldn't be easily smeared with the media hysteria over Aum Shinri Kyo, since Evangelion's own high-tech cultists used Western, not Buddhist, revelations. It should be obvious that if this is viewed as an armor for Evangelion to comment on contemporary Japanese events, it is an effective one—an applicability many Japanese critics in fact accepted.

> "The May 1998 issue would have been called "Book Two, Issue #3" on its cover (that is, it contained the third chapter from vol. 2, Stage 9). It contained a special feature transcribing some of Hiroyuki Yamaga's answers to audience questions at Fanime Con '98 after a screening of Evangelion: Death (True) and Evangelion (Rebirth). I believe Mr. Yamaga's panel was also covered in Protoculture Addicts, but they may have included some remarks and not others (and the reverse is likely true for my piece)."

> Among all 26 episodes of the TV version of "Neon Genesis Evangelion", Director Anno himself wrote the scripts for five episodes, and is credited jointly with other screenwriters for the scripts of 20 episodes. The number of scripts that were jointly credited are the definitive drafts of scripts based on plots by director Anno written by screenwriters and gone over directly by director Anno. The only time where director Anno’s name isn’t credited for a script is episode 4 "Rain, after escaping (Hedgehog’s Dilemma)" based on a plot by Mr. Satsukawa. Just by looking at these numbers, you will understand how much director Anno pulled the series together by his personal authorship.
<http://userpages.umbc.edu/~aaronc1/ura/evangelion_original_1_intro.htm>

> However, despite being made as a group operation, there are TV series that are colored almost entirely by the personality of one individual. Hayao Miyazaki’s "Conan, Boy of the Future" is that way, and many of the series where Yoshiyuki Tomino served as chief director are also the same.
> "Neon Genesis Evangelion" is also a series that was shaped by the personality of its one creator, Hideaki Anno. The worldview, character creation, creation of Mecha, the gadgets, the division of cuts, and even to the point of each line of dialogue, everything is inscribed with the name of "Hideaki Anno." For example, the mental landscape of Anno.is, of course, reflected in the story, behavior patterns of the characters and the like. Anno’s mood is reflected and his intent is clear even in trivial places like the name of a department store or the brand of can coffee that appears.

> Those "thoughts" about a piece of work are, for the viewer, a bit of a sophisticated way of enjoying it. After viewing a piece of work, that work is assimilated in the viewer’s head through thinking, "Did that mean this?" and "Is that right?" and will go on to become the building block of thought. Being able to come across works that can be contemplated is an irreplaceable encounter.
> However, recently I feel that these encounters are scarce. I wonder if I’m just imagining this?
...
> Thinking requires effort. When anime is thought of as "entertainment", I’m not denying that there is also a policy that the audience not be made to use unnecessary effort. Works that are just to been seen and enjoyed. Those are also probably necessary. However, weren't there too many of those types of works? Among those, "Neon Genesis Evangelion" was clearly a work that could be thought about. While keeping its entertainment value as a piece of work, it also offers enjoyment that the audience thinks about. The Eva Boom that you all know about proves that. Everyone is starving for thinking.
> And the story pregnant with riddles concluded, for many of the audience members, still pregnant with those riddles. There were also fans who screamed, "I was betrayed" by that ending. However, this is also certain proof that Eva draws people in.
...
> In reaching the film’s completion, it might also be interesting to try reading about things like how the drama was put together and corrected and how the implications continued to change.

> What is the appeal of Giant Robot Anime?
> "Giant robot anime" is an expression of children’s subconscious desires.
> That is to say, the thing called "giant robot anime"
> Is compensation for the complexes and various suppressions that children hold, a means of resistance, compensatory behavior.
> Adults know "the difficulty of living."
> And, at the same time they also know "the fun of living."
> In order to live, even if they know it is a "lie"
> They know that "hope" and the "dream" called "justice and love" are necessary.
> We can communicate purely to children with no sense of difference between fiction and reality due to a characteristic of the means of expression called animation, namely, usage of the view of the world where everything are "pictures" drawn by people.
> That is the greatest appeal that "giant robot animation" holds.
<http://userpages.umbc.edu/~aaronc1/ura/packet_page_03.htm>

> From the planning stages, Hldeaki Anno, a representative creator of GAINAX, was at the heart of the production work and his individuality colors every aspect of the show. Fascinating characters, a captivating sci-fi premise, dynamic battle scenes, and super-high density of information that incorporates Christianity and psychoanalysis. Each of those elements surpassed the realm of all anime that had come before it and made it a work worthy of the title "New Century (Neon Genesis)."
> From back when it was airing on TV, Neon Genesis Evangelion had the ardent support of fans and its popularity boomed even after it finished its run. Its influence was not limited to anime fans but also spread to the general populace, and it was even called the third impact, following Space Battleship Yamato and Mobile Suit Gundam.

> Reunited with Shinji for the first time in 3 years, the executive commander of NERV, Gendo Ikari, orders him to get on the Eva and out into the field on the spot. And faced with Eva Unit-00 and Rei Ayanami, he repeats over and over, "I Mustn't run away," as if he is trying to convince himself of it. "Communicating with others" is a vital theme of Evangelion and depicting how Shinji interacts with those around him is part of the story of Evangelion. The revealing of why Gendo treats Shinji so coldly is left to Episode Twenty-Six, "My True Heart For You," which was released theatrically.
> When Shinji comes to New Tokyo-3, he sees a girl that seems to be Rei Ayanami for just an instant. Considering how she is injured and wrapped up in bandages, when he later meets her in NERV Headquarters, the natural assumption would be to think that this was a phantom vision. But in Episode 26, "My True Heart For You," a different possibility is suggested. The girl that appeared for just one cut in this scene may be the Rei Ayanami who is "the existence that gazes upon man."
...
> Shinji was supposed to live by himself, but instead, Misato takes him in and the two begin their life together in her apartment.  In order to try to close the gap between her and him, Misato acts silly around Shinji and as if in response to that, Shinji acts exaggeratedly surprised by the presence of Pen Pen, the hot spring penguin.  Seeing Shinji's true intentions in his actions, Misato says to herself, "Maybe I'm the one who's transparent."  It is a most Eva-like depiction concerning "communication."  In the preview, the idea of her taking Shinji in is clearly stated as "Misato's arrogance."  The sense with which they coolly capture such events is also part of the appeal of Evangelion.
...
> Toji, who consciously behaves like a man, and Kensuke, who has his own world of his hobby concerning all things military and who also knows how to get on in the world, are very contrasting characters compared to Shinji. The names of these two characters are taken from the main characters in Ryu Murakami’s The Fascism of Love and Illusions, which provides no small amount of inspiration for Director Anno.
...
> In this episode, Ritsuko talks about the “hedgehog’s dilemma,” which is a psychology term that originates from Schopenhauer’s fable, and it expresses the complications and ambivalence that arises as people seek the psychological distance to maintain between each other. This is where the English episode title “Hedgehog’s Dilemma” for Episode Four “Rain, Escape, and Afterwards” comes from. In addition, what Misato says in this same scene allows us to see what her thoughts on communicating are at this time, so that is also very interesting.
...
> Episode Four depicts the wanderings of Shinji, who has run away from Misato and NERV. Shinji and Misato hurt each other with their thorns as they try to get closer, and yet even then, they need one another. The relationship between these two is indeed just like the “hedgehog’s dilemma” that Ritsuko had mentioned in Episode Three. There is no battle with an Angel and it largely stays away from addressing any of the mysteries, but when considered from a thematic perspective, this is truly Eva-like drama.
> In actuality, this episode was once omitted in terms of the series composition and it was planned that what is now Episode Five would come after Episode Three. But as production progressed, staff members voiced their opinion that perhaps there was a need to depict Shinji’s relationship with the people around him after Episode Three, and thus, this episode was made, greatly changing the contents from what had originally been conceived. Because of this, the script for this episode written after the script for Episode Five had already been finalized. This is the one and only episode of all the TV and movie episodes in which Director Anno did not have a direct hand in the plot and script.
> In terms of performance, the highlight has got to be the final cut at the train station where Shinji and Misato gaze at each other. This cut, which has absolutely no dialogue or movement, lasts roughly 50 seconds. It is a silence that would normally be inconceivably long, but it depicts Shinji’s feelings in finding it difficult to express himself in words.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol1_episode_commentaries.htm>

> Among the footage shown are included a number of characters and images who appear towards the middle and end of the show as well. At the time this show aired, these served as signs of things to come and the presentation of mysteries to the viewers. How will the images of Unit-01's bloody hand and of the bloody utility poles and Unit-01's foot unfold and appear within the story? What is the giant of light that possesses a silhouette that looks like an Eva? Who are the pencil sketches of the woman and the boy with the piercing gaze? What about the mysterious letters in the final scene? Or why does the caption "ANGEL" appear after the scene of the boy's face and the scene of Rei Ayanami? All the answers to the mysteries presented in the opening are presented in the show and the movies.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol2_introduction.htm>
Yes, what *about* those mysterious letters?

> The name “Operation Yashima” is a reference to when Yoichi Nasuno shoots the fan with his bow from atop his horse on the beach in the “Battle at Yashima” in the first year of Bunji (1185). That’s Chief of Operations Katsuragi for you, quite the intellectual. In addition, “Yashima” written differently is also the old name for Japan. Thus, the name also contains a reference to the operation gathering electrical power from all of Japan.
...
> You can also enjoy the Kihachi Okamoto-esque camerawork that Director Anno excels at. The drama of communication between Shinji and Misato also hits a plateau. The segment From Episode One to this episode can be thought of as the “Prologue Arc” of the series.
> Misato is normally slovenly, but here, she gallantly stops the J.A. without any regard for her own life. Shinji is disappointed by the enormous difference between these two sides of her, but at the end, he learns that the reason she shows that defenseless side of her to him is because that’s how much she trusts him. Back-to-back with that is revealed the ironic truth that the J.A. going out of control and the miracle that Misato and the others brought about were all plotted by Gendo, but the way Shinji begins to walk forward when he understands that his relationship with Misato has become closer is refreshing enough to even erase the sense of upset.
...
> The name of J.A comes from the robot, Jet Jaguar, which appeared in the special effects film Gozilla vs Megalon (1973). Jet Jaguar was a robot whose design was chosen from submissions from the public, and when it was initially announced, its name was Red Alone. Jet Alone is a name made by combining Red Alone and Jet Jaguar. It is truly a geeky GAINAX-like name.
...
> This episode depicts the actions of Eva Unit-02 and its pilot, Asuka Langley Sohryu. Starting here, the series charges into the second part, the “Action Arc,” which depicts battles with various Angels in standalone episodes. The spirited character of Asuka ushers in a new phase of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Apparently, Asuka’s character became solidified in Director Anno’s mind when he came up with the lines “This is my Chance!” and “What are you, stupid?!”
...
> The contents of the trunk that Kaji is carrying looks like a human embryo and Gendo calls this “the first man, Adam.” In Episode Seven in the SSTO conversation, they were talking about the “revised budget for the sample collection,” but that sample is probably this Adam. Adam’s existence is one of the greatest mysteries in this show. Could it be related to the Adam that appears in the Old Testament? The name of Adam’s wife in the Old Testament is Eva.
...
> Episode Nine is also the episode where Asuka's character gets filled in. At the beginning in the scene where she talks to Rei at school, she is standing on the edge of the flower bed, but this is because in Director Anno's plans regarding her, one of the things was "she is a girl who endeavors to stand at a higher spot compared to the person she is addressing when greeting people." In Episode Eight, she also addresses Shinji from the top of the elevator.
> Asuka says, "This is the wall of Jericho, never to fall!" of the sliding door that separates the two rooms, but the "Wall of Jericho" is a reference to the Western film It Happened One Night (1934, America). In the movie, a rich runaway girl and an unemployed newspaper reporter end up spending a night in the same room, and they put a blanket as a divider, calling it the "Wall of Jericho." Incidentally, the original "Wall of Jericho" is a castle wall that appears in the Bible. Also, she says, "It is proper that boys and girls sleep apart after the age of seven," but the correct proverb is "it is proper that the boys and girls sit apart after the age of seven." This is a saying in the ancient Chinese Confucian text of The Book of Rites, and the seat refers to a straw mat. In ancient China, sitting on the same mat meant that the two were husband and wife. Is it the genius girl's pride that leads her to want to use difficult sayings, even though she's not supposed to be used to Japanese yet?
...
> At the beginning, Hyuga compares the data on the Seventh Angel and says, "Pattern blue, confirmed as an Angel," and at the time, the screen displays "BLOOD TYPE: BLUE." In the scene before that, with the data on the Sixth Angel that Ritsuko had analyzed, it also has "6th ANGEL pattern: BLOOD TYPE: BLUE." This indicates that it is an Angel. The term "BLOOD TYPE: BLUE" comes from a sci-fi film directed by Kihachi Okamoto called Blue Christmas (1978, Japan).
...
> There is also a scene depicting the three operators taking a break between work. Maya Ibuki is reading a romance novel. Makoto Hyuga is reading a comic magazine. Shigeru Aoba has a music magazine next to him as he mimics playing a guitar. Aoba's hobby is to play the guitar, and in Episode Eleven, he can be seen coming to work with a guitar case containing an electric guitar. This was never realized, but there was an idea of having him play his guitar and singing nearby Shinji and the others in the final scene on the hill.
> The model that the Eighth Angel was based on was the Anomalocaris, the largest carnivore of the Cambrian Period. The Anomalocaris was taken up on the NHK Special Life - A Long Journey of 4 Billion Years (1994, Japan), and at the time the show aired, the creature was a hot topic.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol2_episode_commentaries.htm>

> Furthermore, this is also the one and only Angel that appeared somewhere other than New Tokyo-3. Its object is believed to have been one of two things, either the Unit-02 being transported by the Pacfic fleet or the contents of Ryoji Kaji's trunk.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol2_angel_profiles.htm>
shouldn't you guys know?

> This episode depicts the commotion and a battle with an Angel with the great blackout at NERV Headquarters in the background. Paper fans, candles, buckets and other small props that are generally not seen around NERV Headquarters make an appearance here. The "It's lukewarm" at the end of Part A is the one and only gag utilizing Gendo, but there are numerous humorous scenes, including when Hyuga takes over an election PR car and the various raggedy antics of the three Children. The glimpse into an awareness of the problem of modern life relying too much on a technological civilzation could also be said to be very Director Hideaki Anno-like. The English subtitle is a reference to a sci-fi movie classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951, America)
...
> The animation for this episode was handled by Studio Ghibli, known for their work on such films as My Neighbor Totoro. Nozomu (written as "peek") Takahashi, the city assembly electoral candidate, who only appears as a name is a twist on the producer of Ghibli, Nozomu (written as "aspire") Takahashi.
...
> At the sea at the South Pole, where Gendo and Fuyutsuki travel on board an aircraft carrier, the waters are red and there are giant pillars of salt. This is also due to the effect of the Second Impact. Gendo calls the post-Second Impact South Pole “a world that has been purged, untainted by the original sin.” In general, original sin refers to the sin Adam, the father of mankind, committed in “Genesis” of the Old Testament, as well as to the sin that all of mankind was burdened with as a result of it. In the conversation in this scene, it is revealed that Fuyutsuki and Gendo disagree on various topics, such as the Second Impact, mankind, and science. Fuyutsuki says, “I prefer the world where man lives, no matter how tarnished by sin it is.” One wonders how he felt being involved in the Human Instrumentality Project.
> “By the hand of man” and “a miracle has value when it is brought about” are two lines that are familiar from some of Director Anno’s previous works. In this episode, it is revealed that Rei dislikes meat, but Nadia: Secret of Blue Water was also a vegetarian. Director Anno himself is also famous for not eating meat. Incidentally, Rei orders a garlic ramen without the pork at a ramen shop, but the script has Rei ordering seaweed ramen. It is a rare example of pure adlibbing on the part of a voice actress in this show.
...
> The supercomputer MAGI is composed of three different computer systems, Melchior-1, Balthasar-2, and Casper-3. Various calculations, problems and operations are examined by these three. The naming of the MAGI come from the three wise men from the East, who foretold the birth of Jesus in the "New Testament." The names Melchior, Balthasar, and Casper are also taken from each of the wise men. The word "magi" also means "astrology" and is the origin of the English word "magician."
> In order to prevent the Angel from invading the lower regions of NERV headquarters, Gendo completely physically seals off the region in the Central Dogma below the Sigma Unit. The pyramid-shaped building standing in the Geo-front is but a small part of the NERV Headquarters. Stretching directly below the square lake adjoining the pyramid-shaped building is an incredibly deep facility going down approximately 7km. The majority of this incredibly deep facility is called the Central Dogma and the Sigma Unit is a part of it. Incidentally, the name Central Dogma came from biology. Genetic information is transferred DNA=>RNA=>protein, and this flow of genetic information is called the central dogma.

> Every so often, the show was aired at an irregular time in the Tokyo region, such as on January 3rd, when it was aired at 8 a.m., and thus, Episode Fourteen was created as a recap episode of sorts. The English subtitle is also a reference to the fact that this episode is a recap.
...
> Part A has no BGM, and there is also very little dialogue. The lack of "sound" and the heavy use of Bold Mincho captions create a stifling tension. The structure of displaying the subtitle at the end of Part A was also effective. In addition, in Part A, the names of the Angels and operations that had appeared up through Episode Twelve "The Value of a Miracle" became clear. The names of the Angels are the same as the names of angels that appear in the Bible, and each of their spheres of influence, characteristics, and the situations in which they appear are consistent. At the end of Part A, the terms "Dead Sea Scrolls" and "SEELE" appear for the first time. Generally, the "Dead Sea Scrolls" refers to the ancient documents discovered in a cave on the west bank of the Dead Sea in 1947. They contained the "Old Testament," the "Apocrypha," and other religious writings not included in the Bible. They are thought to be writings from around 200-100 B.C., meaning around the era that Christ was alive. Though it is said to be the greatest find of this century, full disclosure of it to the public was dragged out for another 45 years. Additionally, there is speculation that parts of it have been deliberately withheld from being released due to it containing writings that shake the very foundation of Christianity. It is unclear whether the "Dead Sea Scrolls" that they speak of are the actual "Dead Sea Scrolls." SEELE is the controlling organization of NERV and its members seem approximately the same as the Human Instrumentality Committee. Seele means "soul" in German.
...
> In the final scene, what Unit-02 is holding is the Spear of Longinus that was being transported from the South Pole in Episode Twelve. In the Bible, the Spear of Longinus is the spear that pierced Christ on the crucifix.

> Starting with this episode, the drama is presented more densely, entering into the third part, which drives the theme strongly. The first episode inthis part, Episode Fifteen, shines a spotlight on the human relationships between such people as Misato and Kaji, Shinji and Gendo, Asuka and Shinji, etc.
...
> Through kaji's investigations, it is revealed that the organization created to select Eva pilots, the Marduk Institute, is largely insubstantial. The name for the Marduk Institute comes from a Babylonian god said to have 50 names. The god Marduk had 50 names, and the Marduk Institute in Eva was using 108 names.
> The homeostasis that Ritsuko mentioned is a biology term that refers to a quality that creatures have that allows them to maintain their physical and biological condition within stable levels and to survive in response to various changes in their enviroment. The American biologist Canon (Walter Bradford Canon: 1871 - 1945) proposed it as a universal principle of life. Combining that with its companion concept of transistasis to come up with the idea that "having these two contradictory qualities is what defines life" is original to this series.
...
> Episode sixteen depicts the fight against the Twelfth Angel that takes its opponent into imaginary space and Shinji's struggle within the inner space. This is an episode that could only be a part of Eva, possessing two very disparate appealing aspects in its depiction of sci-fi drama and the abyss that is the "human heart." And the scene of Shinji's inner space in the latter part of Part B could be said to be one of the finest examples of this. This sequence on board a train car at dusk with no one else present depicts the world of Shinji's heart in a most vivid way by using methods that could even be called experimental, such as expressing the character as a white "line" on a black screen and interjecting various images throughout the sequence. In addition, the image of "inside a mother's womb" can be taken from the entry plug that Shinji can't escape from, and the image of "giving birth" can be taken from the scene where Unit-01 escapes from within the Angel, covered in blood. Thus, this is also an episode with strong symbolism.
> In the inner space sequence, the question, "Is it okay to live by stringing only the happy things in life together like a rosary?" is presented, and later on, it becomes one of the themes carried throughout the series. In the same sequence, Shinji's mother, Yui Ikari, appears for the first time. Shinji's line, "No. Mother was smiling," serves as a foreshadowing to the mystery involving Yui. Also, there is a directional reason for why she is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara, who also voices Rei Ayanami.
> The episode title is a reference to "The Sickness Unto Death" (Sygdommen til Doden, 1849), the most important work put out by the father of existentialism, the philosopher Soren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-1855) of Denmark. "The sickness unto death" refers to "despair," and in the introduction of this work, Kierkegaard says that for a Christian, "Even death itself is not 'the sickness unto death.' Not to mention any of the suffering on Earth known as destitution, illness, misery, privations, misfortune, pain, anguish, grief, or regret." The English episode title, "Splitting of the Breast" refers to a psychological process by which an infant's impression of the breast becomes split into two, a "good object" and a "bad object."
> The "Dirac's sea" that took Shinji and Unit-01 in is a concept that the British theoretical physicist Dirac (Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac: 1902-1984) used in his hole theory. A vacuum is filled with negative energy electrons, and this is what is called "Dirac's sea."
...
> The three episodes spanning Episode Seventeen to Episode Nineteen are a serial piece called the "First Child Trilogy." This serial piece is the greatest climax in the middle of the series and also holds important meaning in terms of Shinji's drama. The first of these episodes, Episode Seventeen, is one that focuses on depicting daily life. The main plot is of Toji being chosen as the fourth Eva pilot and of how he finds his resolve concerning that, but at the same time, such things as Shinji's growth as a person, Rei's emotional uncertainty, and Hikaru's romantic feelings are also depicted. Episode Eighteen and Episode Nineteen, which follow, become more intense in terms of both drama and action. This episode is meant to be "the calm before the storm."
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol4_episode_commentaries.htm>

> In a conversation with Kaji, Shinji says, "You know, I'm a man." So far, Misato and Asuka have repeatedly harangued him about, "You're a man, aren't you?" and he never offered a response, but now, he says this without a hitch. Does this mean he is feeling more at ease, just as Toji had said in Rei's room? It is also noteworthy that he looks at Toji with a smile as Toji stubbornly declares that cleaning is not a man's job. In Shinji and Kaji's conversation at the watermelon field, the topics covered are once again "enjoying" and "suffering," following up on the inner space in Episode Sixteen "The Sickness Unto Death, and..."
> The people who performed the English operator dialogue at the beginning were Michael House, George A. Arriola, and Hiromi Arriola. Michael House was a GAINAX employee at the time, who did m-house translation work. George A Arriola and Hiromi Arriola were friends of his and are apparently husband and wife.
> The English title for this episode is "Ambivalence." Ambivalence refers to a state where two contradictory emotions or attitudes exist at the same time within an individual. It was originally a psychoanalytical term, which was first used by a Swiss psychoanalyst, Bleuler (Paul Eugen Bleuler: 1857-1939). Perhaps the title ofl "Ambivalence" was given to this episode because Shinji is conflicted between his mission to defeat Unit-03 and his emotional reluctance to fight Unit-03, which has a human pilot on board.
...
> As the story unfolds, Shinji resolves to fight on his own and gets on board the Eva. And with a fierce battle that can truly be called "a man's battle," Episode Nineteen is upheld by the fans as having the most exciting content in the series. However, what in fact defeats the Angel is neither his resolve nor his fighting spirit, but the berserk Unit-01. Having aggressively faced the Angel, Shinji is taken in by Unit-01 as a result, and there is not even any portrayal of him realizing victory. In that sense, this episode also has a most Eva-like ironic structure.
> The English episode title "Introjection" is a psychoanalytic term meaning "to take in." It refers to taking in various attributes of another person and making it one's own. It is one form of a defense mechanism. For example, by taking in a mother's prohibitive or denying aspects, the super-ego is formed. Introjection is a term that refers to a phenomenon that occurs in the world of the psyche, but in this episode, it is likely used both in terms of its original meaning and how Unit-01 took in the Angel's abilities.
> In the entry plug, Shinji's body has become one with the LC.L. and separated from his psyche, Ritsuko sets a plan in motion to reconstruct his body and get his psyche to anchor itself in it. As the English episode title "Weaving A Story 2" indicates, this episode is a summary of sorts, like Episode Fourteen. In point of fact, it is made largely centered around the reuse of already existing composite material and film, however its contents do not look back on what happened in the past but tell a completely different story. Having become an existence solely consisting of his psyche, Shinji agonizes and suffers over things like "his relationship to others" and "the establishment of self." Depictions in his inner space is the locus of this episode and just as in Episode Sixteen, experimental methods are abundantly used. Also, with this episode as a turning point, This show begins to show a stronger tendency to directly portray "the human mind."
> Ritsuko says that the Eva "contains a human will" and that the fact Shinji was taken in "might be the Eva's will as well." Misato felt she was saying it jokingly, but when considered along with things like how the story unfolds later and how Ritsuko said, "So, she's awoken..." in Episode Nineteen, it becomes clear that what Ritsuko said is conveying the truth to Misato to a certain degree.
> Towards the end of Part A, Shinji recalls that he knew the Eva even earlier and that when he found out, he ran away from his mother and father. And the images of that flashback are the scene of the experiment from Episode Twenty-One "NERV Is Born," in which Yui Ikari is the subject. Shinji ran away from that site, and that incident is likely what planted the compulsive idea that he "must not run away".
> While the final scene at the love hotel contained no explicit images, the love scene was depicted boldly, which caused quite a stir when it was originally aired. After touching upon Misato's tryst, Ritsuko's line, "I guess I'm in no position to talk," is also curious.
> The English episode title "oral stage" is also a psychoanalytical term. The oral stage is the first stage of development in Freud's (Sigmund Freud: 1856-1939) libido development theory. It is the time period when the mouth serves as the principal source of pleasure. It is said that the oral stage starts at birth and ends around the age of 1 1/2. in the scene where Misato and Ritsuko are in the car, a radio DJ show can be heard from the car radio. We can suppose that this is the same show that was airing in Episode Twelve. A woman DJ is advising a listener on their romantic problems, but the term "oral stage" appears here as well. In this case, the oral stage refers to the oral personality. In other words, it points to personality tendencies that strongly lean towards being dependent and needy for love People with an oral personality happily sacrifice themselves in order to obtain the love of others. Shinji could be said to have an oral personality at this point in time.

> Neon Genesis Evangelion has numerous mysteries to engross the fans. After all 26 episodes of the TV series were aired, the remake version of Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode were released as a theatrical piece, in which several of the mysteries were resolved. Or there were clues presented with which to think about the mysteries. Furthermore, in the video version (released on LD and VHS at the time) of Episodes Twenty-One through Twenty-Four, which were released after the movie opened, new footage was added that also presented information regarding the mysteries.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol6_introduction.htm>

> If you look at Eva as a story whose protagonists are Gendo and Fuyutsuki, then the heroine would be Yui Ikari. She fascinates Fuyutsuki and she says, "He's quite a sweet person," of Gendo. Gendo's resolve to advance the Human Instrumentality Project is surely also related to her disappearance. Many mysteries, such as the Eva and Adam, the circumstances of Ayanami's birth, Unit-01 going out of control, etc., are linked with Yui's existance.
...
> When it was first aired on TV, it seems no few fans suspected that it was Misato that shot Kaji in this episode. In the "video version," dialogue explaining that SEELE has discovered that Kaji has delivered a sample of Adam to Gendo and has made his position precarious has been added and the way the scene where Kaji is shot conects to the next scene has been changed. It leads the audience to think that the culprit is someone on SEELE's side.
...
> In the fourth part, the drama unfolds taking an even deeper look into the characters. Not only Shinji, but Asuka, Rei, and Misato are put through hearth-wrenching experiences. In Episode Twenty-Two, the spotlight is on the Unit-02 pilot, Asuka Langley Sohryu. It becomes clear why she had been so hung up on the Eva and worked so excessively hard, and when that is uncovered by the Angel, she loses her psychological balance. Just as it holds true for the Fifteenth Angel that appears in this episode, non of the Angels that appear in the fourth part launch brute force attacks, but instead, try to shake the Eva pilots psychologically.
> The big additions in the "video version" are the carrier at the beginning, the scene where Asuka is looking at Shinji and Rei at the station, and the bath scene. The highlight is the struggle in Asuka's inner space when she is being attacked psychologically, which took as much as 70 cuts to accomplish. In the station scene, she speaks nastily of Shinji and Rei's relationship, saying, "He is totally back to his usual thing again." Perhaps Asuka thought that the two were a couple or at least in a relationship close to it. Note that in the struggle in her inner space, a scene where she is hanging her head in dejection with the sliding door closed has been newly inserted after the scene from Episode Nine, "Moment and Heart Together," where she shuts the sliding door. And likewise, after the kiss scene from Episode Fifteen, "Lies and Silence," there is a new scene showing her looking frustrated after rinsing her mouth. And from Asuka's dialogue that overlaps these scenes, it becomes clear that she has been looking for help and love from Shinji.
...
> In the fourth part, the effectiveness of certain important scenes has been increased by the use of well-known classical pieces as BGM. The piece used in this episode is Handel's oratorio "Messiah." Messiah means savior and the lyrics have been taken from the Bible. The piece portays the prophecy of Christ's birth all the way to his resurrection in three parts.
...
> Episode Twenty-Three is the episode where the spotlight falls on Rei Ayanami. The secrets of her inner thoughts, her death, and her third self are depicted. This is also the episode where Ritsuko's drama is depicted, and just as the title "Tears" indicates, Rei cries in the first half and Ritsuko cries in the second half. The way the story unfolds in a cool, detached way in spite of the fact the episodes portrays the life and death, and the love and hate, of the characters is very much in character with this show.
...
> Standing before the Reis in the tank, Ritsuko speaks of the relationship between Rei and the dummy plugs, and also of the relationship between "God" and the Evas. It is a scene that provides the greatest amount of information regarding the mysteries in Eva. What exactly is this "God" who disappeared 15 years ago? Was it not Adam appeared 15 years ago? She said that the "God" humans resurrected was Adam, but is this Adam the embryo-like Adam that showed up in Episode Eight? Or could it possibly be the giant underground? In the same scene, Ritsuko says, "The Chamber of Gaf was empty, you see." The Chamber of Gaf, according to Hebrew legends, is a room in the house of God in Heaven where the souls dwell. Babies receive a soul from this room before they are born. It is said that if there are no more souls in the Chamber of Gaf, it is an omen that the world will fall to ruin.

> Up to this point, Neon Genesis Evangelion has depicted themes surrounding "the human heart" and "communication between people" through the stories of the main characters.  However, the climactic episodes, Episode Twenty-Five "The World Ending" and the Final Episode "The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World," reverse the relationship between the story and the theme. What would normally be considered the story is kept to the bare minimum and "the theme itself" is told. The material is theoretical and experimental, and without a doubt, something never seen before in TV animation. When it originally aired, it became an incredibly hot topic and divided the fans in their opinion.
> The conclusion to the drama and illuminating the mysteries. In response to fans clamoring for those two things, it was decided that there would be a remake of Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode.  The result of that are Episode 25 "Air" and Episode 26 "A Pure Heart For You," which were released as the theatrical "The End of Evangelion."
> Thus, the story of Eva would branch into two stories with the diverging point being the end of Episode Twenty-Four "The Final Messenger."  The two stories each unfold differently and arrive at their own climaxes.  Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode tell the theme directly.  And the other version, Episode 25 and Episode 26, depict the same, following the story.  It is not that one is the complete version and the other is incomplete.  Just like the multiple endings of a game, two different endings were prepared for one story.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol7_introduction.htm>


> Kaworu only appears in this episode of the show, but his unique atmosphere and his relationship with Shinji led to his character garnering overwhelming support from female fans. When you disassemble the character for his last name, “Nagisa”, it becomes “shi” and “sha”. Thus, it is a play on the sub-title, “The Final Messenger (saigo no shisha)”. The “Nagisa (shore)” also forms a pair with Rei Ayanami's “nami (wave)”.
> Only the fourth movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Opus 125 “Choral” is used as BGM in this episode. Event what Kaworu is humming when he first appears and what Shinji is listening to on the S-DAT are from No. 9, showing quite a thoroughness. During the climax, it plays for over 7 minutes making a strong impact on the audience. The lyrics for the choral “Ode to Joy” are from the poem “To Joy” by the German poet and playwright, Schiller. There is a passage in those lyrics that goes, “We enter, drunk with your fire, Oh heavenly one, into your sanctuary.” it can be thought of as linking to the content of the second half of this episode.
...
> This is a singular piece of work with an exceedingly experimental structure. In spite of the story unfolding only through monologues and conversations between characters, the directing does a brilliant job maintaining the high tension. When it was originally aired, many voiced their opinion that they could not understand the story in Episode Twenty Five and the Final Episode. However, there is actually a bare-bones explanation of the story within the show. That being… Gendo uses Rei to execute the Human Instrumentality Project and the complementation of man begins. Seeing the remakes, Episode 25 “Air” and Episode 26 “A Pure Heart For You”, may in fact make the content of Episode Twenty-Five easier to understand. The depictions of Misato and Ritsuko being shot to death, Unit-02 hugging its knees in the lake, and Asuka likewise hugging her knees within Unit-02 all correspond to Episode 25.
> Gendo says, “All souls will become one and find eternal peace”. His Instrumentality Project must have been for all human souls to be combined as one and to compensate each other for what they have been deprived of. In the story that follows from Episode 25 “Air” to Episode 26 “A Pure Heart For You”, he was not able to execute the scenario he had drawn up. It may be that it was in Episode Twenty-Five and Episode Twenty-Six that his wish actually came true.
> The English subtitle, “Do you love me?” is from the book of the same title written by a British psychotherapist named R.D. Laing (Ronald David Laing: 1927-1989). It is a work that is done in a distinctive style as a discourse between individuals, and the style in which this episode is advanced through conversations between the characters is reminiscent of “Do you love me?”
...
> “Vividly drawing people” is a distinct quality of this show, and it was also the creative theme. In that sense, stepping deeper into Misato's mind using the reason she slept with Kaji as a lead into it can be called the end point for Neon Genesis Evangelion in depicting people.
...
> This is the final episode of the TV series. The year is 2016 A.D., and the complementation of mankind is ongoing. Shinji agonizes over the value of his existence and his relationship with other people and comes to a conclusion. The subtitle “The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World” is fron a story by American sci-fi author Harlan Ellison (1934 - ) of the same name. Taking the subtitle of the final episode from a sci-fi novel is a tradition of Director Anno's works, continuing from Aim for the Top! and Nadia: Secret of Blue Water. The “love (ai)” being written in katakana is likely a play on the “love (ai)” and the English “I”.
> The final episode also takes the unusual route of unfolding entirely within what appears to be the world within Shinji's mind. In terms of technique, there are also various modes of expression used in abundance, such as still photographs, paper anime, and illustrations. Director Anno and the animator You Yoshinari are the ones who did the key animation for the paper anime.
...
> The moment that Shinji gains conviction that it is okay for him to be there, the background changes, and the blue Earth spreads beneath his feet. However, there are no continents on this Earth, and it is covered by a gigantic coral reef. It seems this is the Earth that has been transfigured by the Instrumentality Project. This episode ends with the captions “To my father, thank you.” “To my mother, farewell.” “And to all the Children.” “Congratulations!” Eva is something of an Oedipus complex story, where a boy feels love and hatred for his father and mother, so the first two captions can be thought to means that Shinji has come to an understanding with his father and grown out of his dependence on his mother. Perhaps the latter two captions mean, “This is a world where all the children born into it deserve to live.” It is left for the audience to decide whether this ending is the Best Ending or the Bad Ending.

> So no Genesis 0:0 In the Beginning. Shame, as it has Anno talking about the show, & another Gainax guy in a rowboat. Is there any chance of a translation please?
<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2005-February/002407.html>
TODO find out what this was about

> I think it's just something he wanted to acknowledge, the same way he acknowledges at various points that this is an anime, and people are watching this anime. There's a scene in LOVE & POP with an actor dressing as Anno famously did, that is resonant with the masturbation scene in THE END OF EVANGELION, I think.
<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2007-January/003901.html>
TODO I really need to watch that movie

> Here, I've found what I had lost--Anno said this with a heartfelt voice.
> How could Toyoko Academy have nothing but nice people like this? No bullying, no violence, no failures to communicate...the editorial staff were themselves profoundly moved to find that a school such as this exists in a society full of ugliness, hate, and despair. Is it really like this, though? We asked the students to tell us more.
...
> Kashiwara: Even within a given class, we respect one another. It makes me feel good to have such good friends. We pat one another on the back when we do something good, and cry together when something sad happens.
> Anno: Here, I have found what I had lost. I guess I've just gotten hard and crusty. But my heart is bursting at the thought that people like you still exist.
<http://web.archive.org/web/20050211083730/www.gainax.co.jp/special/kiiteyo/toyoko02-e.html>

> Anno: There's really nothing I can say here. I mean, I've been aware of the existence of high-school students like you, intellectually. Right now, I'm working on an anime series based on a girls' manga, but the world of girls' comics, where everyone is nice, looks completely unreal to me. It's a major surprise to find that there are people in the world who praise others so unreservedly. I guess such people really do exist after all.
> Kashiwara: Do unpleasant things really exist?
> Anno: There's no need to go out of your way to find them.

> Kasagi: I think that's one of your good points, though, Aya (Kashiwara). You're confident in yourself, so you can't let anyone see even a little bit of breakdown. You practice in secret, out of pride.
> Anno: You should start by throwing away your public image.
> All: "Public image?"
> Anno: Yes, the image you decide on, where you are this or that character type.
> Kashiwara: There are times, though, when you think that you can't cry because you are who you are. You do have your particular character. I get the feeling that that's how the teachers really see the students. There are harsh things which they would say to me because I can handle it, but that they wouldn't say to a student who's more easily hurt by such things. I've never cried, even when I'm hurting, because I practice hard at home. I've made modifications to my home. I installed a barre and other stuff, and did it all myself.
<http://web.archive.org/web/20050211083507/www.gainax.co.jp/special/kiiteyo/toyoko06-e.html>

> Murayama: I'd like to work with film and video. I was really impressed by Evangelion, and it's gotten me interested in anime and stuff like that lately.
> Anno: I apologize for getting you all worked up. You'd best stay away from it.
...
> Murayama: It looks incredible from where I'm sitting.
> Anno: I can't really be all that proud of my own work.
> Murayama: Is that so? I think it's terrific.
> Anno: It doesn't matter whether one does this kind of work or not, so you're better off not doing it.
> Murayama: I think it's great to be doing what you want.
> Anno: You've got it all wrong. This is the only thing I can do. Getting married, having kids, and raising them to be adults--that's far and away more of an accomplishment than making a movie. And the biggest accomplishment of all is to do all of that and make anime at the same time. In my case, I've managed to get this far because I gave up everything else. I don't see any need for anyone else to sacrifice everything else in life for this, though.
...
> Anno: But if you like it, who cares? You need to like this sort of thing a certain amount to be able to do it. And once you've given it up, you'll be OK.
> Takahashi: Once you've given it up?
> Anno: Right. The instant you wake up to reality again. When you realize that enjoyment alone won't see you through.
> Shibasaki: You mean, you give it up, but even then, you still keep doing it?
> Anno: Well, that's where you find out what you're really made of. To some extent, anyone can each a certain level of achievement if they try. Whether they can go beyond that point depends on the given indivdual. Going beyond that point requires quality. Hard work alone won't do it. And there will always be someone better than you. If you get carried away by how good you are, what do you suppose will happen when you discover that there are far better people in the world already?
...
> Anno: Exactly. I put my work ahead of everything, which makes me cold. I sacrifice people, including myself. Going that far is like being prepared to die.
<http://web.archive.org/web/20050211080410/www.gainax.co.jp/special/kiiteyo/fujimi04-e.html>

> Takahashi: But don't your parents tell you things like, "That's why Japan is going into the toilet"? When I say that I think things are OK, my folks reply with, "That's what's wrong with the Japanese way of thinking."
> Mutoo: I hate America.
> Anno: (laughs)
> Mutoo: I've learned to hate it.
> Takahashi: I bet people who debate international relations all hate America.
> Mutoo: Is all they do in America to criticize others without looking at themselves? Don't they act like they're the greatest? Always saying they're the world's best.
> Hirata: I don't like America either. Right now, Japan's economy is bad. But when it was really good, America said that it was doing too well, and now that it's bad, they won't help us out. They just say that it's our own fault. Makes me think, who do they think they are, anyway?
> All: (laughter)
...
> Anno: Asia is where it's at now. We'd best get in good with our neighbors. The previous generation is with America. Those currently in their 50's typically think in terms of America. In reaction to losing the War to America, they all want to live the American lifestyle. Like all going to Europe, that sort of thing.
> Takahashi: I get that feeling when I read theses written by people of that time.
> Anno: It's like an America-first philosophy. In my generation, though, you turn more and more to domestic matters, look more inward. When I was in the boondocks of Yamaguchi, Tokyo as I saw it on TV looked so incredible, so I always wanted to go there. I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend college, that sort of thing.

> Anno: Put it on TV, though, and old ladies with time on their hands watch it. We got one such old lady calling the TV station while "Evangelion" was on the air, saying that we shouldn't have sexy scenes.
> Miyabu: Just for that?
> Anno: Yep. There's no sense of realism about high school students having a romance without sex, is there. I'm thinking about putting a message at the beginning of each episode telling grade-school students not to watch.
> Miyabu: Are the main characters of "Kareshi Kanojo no Jijoo" going to be junior-high or high school students?
> Anno: They're in their first year of high school, and in the manga they've recently had sex. And it just happened, without any buildup. I'm trying to figure out how to make something dramatic out of this. Could that be the way it is? Do they just do it?
> Miyabu: What do you think?
> Anno: I think I'm stuck. The male lead seemed to me to be so terribly upstanding, I figured he'd treat her better than that, when he up and has sex with her. He's not the character I thought he was. Maybe that's what it's like nowadays. People don't waste time, or something.
...
> Anno: Everyone defines pure love differently. But old biddies like the one who complained (about Eva) have never experienced it. They do things like that to kill time, because they're dissatisfied with kids today. They're not dissatisfied with themselves, but with their environment, their surroundings. They ignore any blame they may have for their situations, instead blaming everything on anime. I never thought I'd get caught up in it. Nobody sounds as loud as old biddies like those. They have so much time on their hands that instead of calling telephone dating clubs, they call TV stations.

> Anno: I didn't have any girlfriends in high school. I did manga and astronomy, as well as watch anime and play mah jongg. When there was a test, I'd tell my folks I was going to a friend's house to study. We'd play all-night mah jongg, then we'd catch a nap before eventually going to school, and when the test was over we'd go back and play mah jongg some more. It was all anime and mah jongg. Back then, girls avoided me like the plague, because I was so gloomy.
...
> Anno: In junior high, I had a little fling that seemed like love, but wasn't. It turned into a triangle with a pal of mine, and that turned into a crisis. All through high school, I decided that being the way I was, was fine, and had no romances the whole time. Some underclasswomen came on to me, but I showed them no interest. The world was full of things more interesting than women. I was much more interested in making movies back then than dating. I regret it now, though. My life might be different now if I'd had sex back then.
...
> Anno: I don't recommend technical schools. Everyone who goes to one of those places starts off by having the same field of specialty, after all, so monotony soon sets in. Take anime schools for example. You go to one of those, and you've got a gathering of people who've all been social and class outcasts up to now. You'll start suffering the illusion that the world revolves around you as a result. I haven't yet seen anyone who liked anime and who'd ever gotten any use out of what he learned in those places.

> Anno: I hate school, you know? And the thing I hate about it is no different from 20 years ago. Teachers also ought to have hated school, seeing as how they were about the same age as me. So they should have hated it too, you know? Why did becoming teachers change them into teachers?
> All: Sad but true.
> Anno: And it's scary to think that they had to have been students too. The world changes people. Parents too: they had to have been kids themselves once, and yet as parents they're so different.
...
> Noguchi: When it comes to law, you've got privacy safeguards, for example, but there are also things that need to be made public, and in cases where a choice has to be made, it ends up in a courtroom, with the decision being left up to the judge to make.
> Anno: Laws in the light of a trial are unreasonable things. School is acclimatizing you to that, so you won't complain about it.
> Ichikawa: We're being trained, like pets.
> Anno: Absolutely.

> Kawakami: When did you know what you wanted to do with your life, Mr. Anno?
> Anno: I just let life carry me along, like that guy over there said.

> Anno: I was basically the honor-student type up until junior high. I was always on student council, that sort of thing. I got into the best feeder schools in my area, up to high school. I swore that I wouldn't do any more studying once I passed my exams. I didn't like to study, so I studied only the areas and sentences that interested me, and that as little as possible. What good is algebra going to do me in real life, after all?
...
> Anno: When I got a zero, the school not annoyed because they were supposed to be a feeder school. So I made sure not to get negative marks. When I got to high school, all I did was play mah jongg and make 8mm movies. I spent all my high school years just goofing off. So naturally there were no universities I could get into, and at the time, Osaka College of Art had no entrance exams. Rather, I got in on my accomplishments. But I stopped going in my third year, and ended up getting expelled.
...
> Anno: What it boils down to is, society only sees the numbers. When it comes to movies too, there's a need to apply either of two labels, either that it was interesting or that it wasn't. School grades are the same way, because Japan only has one evaluation method, that of negative test scoring. I think cumulative test scoring would be more interesting, personally. In the final analysis, the system is about how can you avoid making mistakes. The top score is set at 100 points. It's a game, and the object is to figure out how to minimize your mistakes and keep teachers from reducing your points. I'd say that the problem lies with this negative scoring system, but if asked, I'd also have to say that cumulative scoring wouldn't solve things either.
...
> Anno: I think it's clear that they're a far cry from when I was in high school. They're smart. I get the feeling that they can see their own lives in an instant, by observing their parents and other grown-ups around them. And I'm enjoying that.
> Kawakami: I heard something to the effect that as part of making anime, you meet and talk with lots of different people.
> Anno: I think that's more or less what I said. Anime and manga are completely fictional picture worlds, and thus what happens in them is impossible in real life. Now, there are two approaches you can take. You can either make it look like a dream all the way to the end, where you bring it back to reality, or you can show reality all the way to the end, and finish up with a dream. A lot of anime starts out as a dream, and ends as a dream. This is no good, because it feels like you're using dreams as a retreat. And Japan is not such a tough place to live.
> I can't help but wonder why people are withdrawing into dreams in a reasonably prosperous country. A lot of these people in particular are anime fans, and for a while I couldn't deal with that. I got fed up with Evangelion too, for that reason. I can't stand people who run away, who refuse to face reality. Surely you'll find something for yourself if you face reality head on. If nothing else, take a good look at your immediate surroundings. Don't turn away from unpleasantness. Have a look at it too. With this in mind, ultimately I want to show a little reality in my works. If nothing else, I don't feel any realism in something that has no reality mixed in with it. Thus, while my next production will be a girl's manga about a high-school girl, it's also partly real.

> Ikeda: You may get really tired, but if you're not aware of it, it's the same as not being tired at all, isn't it? Even if I should realize it and keel over from exhaustion, that's fine, because my life right now is good. It's great. Right now, I figure I'll keep on going the rest of my life, in just this way.
> Anno: Speaking with a sense of grandmotherly concern, the scariest part of that line of reasoning is when you actually do keel over.
> Ikeda: As long as each moment of my life is pleasurable, that's fine.
> Anno: Exactly. That's just what that kind of person will say.
...
> Ikeda: Is it so radical to think that tomorrow may not come?
> Anno: Yeah, I think it's better to believe that tomorrow is always with us, rather than that it can be cleanly cut away. That doesn't mean that you do the same thing tomorrow as today, though. It's important to form an image of tomorrow being even just a little different, say, even as little 3% or 5%, from today. If you believe that you want to be a certain way, chances are you'll move in that direction. Having a clear image is the key.
...
> Takagi: I want to destroy the system itself.
> Anno: It's tougher than you might think. I've tried numerous times, and I'll tell you, it's not at all easy. (Everyone laughs) The work itself is pretty enjoyable. But it's a fleeting pleasure.

> Nagamori: What matters is how the pieces shake out.
> Anno: As long as you're not dead, you'll be OK.
> Ikeda: Then I'm safe. People tell me I wouldn't die even if I were murdered.
> Anno: I've known my share of girls, but it's always the ones who tell you they're absolutely all right, they're the ones you have to watch out for...
...
> Uehara: Are you happy with the work you're doing currently?
> Anno: Yes, I am.
> Takagi: Does it feel like it's a hobby?.
> Anno: It feels like a hobby that keeps going on.
...
> Ikeda: It's a sure bet that you (Takagi) will end up homeless.
> Anno: I think that's OK too.
> Ikeda: It's not OK. You end up withering away, saying "It really should have turned out differently."
> Anno: And if you end your life that way, that's fine too.

Carl Horn, in the Viz manga letters, mentions that Yamaga in Fanimecon '98 called the religious elements "only window dressing". - in PA #39? TODO: check PA ILL

> Sadamoto: The original Evangelion film, End of Evangelion really expressed (creator) Hideaki Anno's psychological landscape at the time. I'm taking Anno's story as a basis, and filtering it through the lens of my own interpretation. I've always considered Evangelion to be, at its heart, the story of the relationship between a father and his son. I've been pursuing this angle from the outset of the manga series, and I'd like to pursue it to the end.
...
> S: The new films were originally intended to be a sort of "digest" of the original television series, but as you can see particularly with You Can (Not) Advance, they've begun to take a direction of their own. The theme will be that of isolation, if I'm not mistaken, and I don't believe that the story will be connected to my manga adaptation. That said, I'd like it if fans appreciated the new films and my manga version as separate stories.
...
> S: Around the time Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise came out, I was young and competitive and channeled all of my efforts into drawing characters that were as detailed and realistic as possible. Taking note of this and reflecting upon it as I began the character designs for my next project, Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water, I tried to make characters that were more animated and expressive, the way that they are in manga. Moving from that project to Evangelion, then on to The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and eventually to Summer Wars, I think that I've slowly eased back into a more detailed and realistic style. Well, FLCL and Diebusters are exceptions, of course (laughter).
> Particularly with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summer Wars it was important for me to create designs that fit (director) Mamoru Hosoda's ungilded style of presentation, with the result that, visually, I think the designs do share a lot in common with the designs I did for The Wings of Honneamise.
....
> S: The new films are so accessible! It really surprised me; it wasn't what I had been expecting. There are certain small details in the presentation, like the way music from the Showa Period is played in the background, that I thought were very Anno-esque, though (laughter). In general, the new films are something just about anybody can enjoy and appreciate. Anno's really calmed down since getting married (laughter).
> A lot of people are saying that Shinji is much more optimistic and willful in the new films, particularly in You Can (Not) Advance, but I've always thought that the original film, End of Evangelion, was the exception. Shinji is pretty dark and introspective in End of Evangelion, but I never got that impression of him watching the television series. I was really moved by Shinji's strength and unwillingness to give up in You Can (Not) Advance. I also thought that Rei's character was much less of a question mark. She was more fleshed out. Her speaking style is so rapid fire (laughter)! I really thought that you can perceive her gradual change in character in the new films. Asuka's also more approachable as a character. In a bit of a change from the original series, she doesn't just reject Shinji outright, but actually displays a degree of jealousy. Her character feels more like an actual teenage girl.
> The original series, the original film, and the new films are all windows into Anno's inner world, so it's interesting to see all of these changes.
...
> S: I thought it was fitting that the new films should include a new character. I really strove to design a character who was distinct from Asuka and Rei, though I do worry that there are some small but telling similarities that remain. My idea was to create a character so distinct from the other Evangelion characters as to almost feel out of place in the Evangelion world. I suppose I could've designed her as a sort of "halfway point" between Asuka and Rei, but Asuke and Rei are both such strong characters, in their own separate ways. I wanted to bring something completely different to the table with Mary.
> For Mary, I'd been asked to design a character who "goes about with a parasol, like the sort of heroine you see in an anime". As I initially designed her, she was very adult-like, having attended a strict private Christian school in Britain. However, in the original script, there was a scene where she returns home to a room full of birds and dogs and begins talking to them, to indicate that she was also rather idiosyncratic. Mr. Anno had also requested that she be more adult-like in appearance and manner than either Asuka or Rei, to set her apart. And that she have a huge chest (laughter).
> There was a television drama I'd really been enjoying at the time I began designing Mary. The heroine in this drama had a pair of long ponytails. I really liked this character feature, and worked it into Mary's design. After all was said and done, we ended up with the design that we have now, although there are still many elements of my personal tastes and interests of the time in Mary's design (laughter).
> Incidentally, I decided to give Mary glasses because I thought that this would be a simple yet affective way to set her apart from the other characters. Some people have said that she "doesn't seem like an Evangelion character", which is exactly what I was aiming for. I'm glad to see, though, that the majority of people have appreciated her character.
> YA: How did you go about designing Mary's uniform and plug suits?
> S: I'd been asked to make Mary seem very British, so I tried to design accordingly. For her school uniform, I thought that a large bow and long socks, along with a traditional checked skirt, would look the part.
> For Mary's old plug suit, I combined a rich green that seemed to me very reminiscent of British clothing with the design aesthetic of the space suits the Soviets were using around the time of the Cold War. The Soviet space suits are the reason for the checkered pattern of the lower half of the suit. Because Unit Five uses a lance, I also looked at a lot of fencing outfits and tried to incorporate elements of those into the design of her suit, as well. However, I also included what look like large plugs where pipes and the like could go, to convey the impression that this is, after all, a plug suit just the same as those of Shinji and the others.
> On the other hand, when I designed her new plug suit, I wanted it to look more sleek, capable and well-crafted than the other plug suits. I wanted it to have the appearance of something that was just manufactured using the latest technology. For inspiration, I looked at the design differences between the Lotus Elise Series I and Series II. Lotus' vehicles really have that feel of a classic design updated to the cutting edge.

> 2 - Can you give us the status of ongoing projects including Aoki Uru and feature Tadashi Hiramatsu (Ghost Rhapsody)?
> Aoki Uru est un projet de Hiroyuki Yamaga et constitue une sorte de suite au premier long métrage du studio, Wings of Honneamise. Aoki Uru is a project of Hiroyuki Yamaga and is a kind of sequel to the first feature film studio, Wings of Honneamise. Ce projet datant d'une dizaine d'années, il fut interrompu assez rapidement faute de sponsors. This project dating back ten years, he was interrupted quickly enough due to lack of sponsors. Actuellement, M. Yamaga aimerais relancer l'idée qui a mûrir sur de nouvelles bases depuis. Currently, Mr. Yamaga like to revive the idea that mature on a new basis since. Personnellement, ce projet étant quelque chose d'innovant à tous points de vue, j'ai le sentiment que la production s'avèrera difficile si cela doit être produit uniquement au sein de notre studio. Personally, this project is something innovative at all points of view, I feel that the production will prove difficult if this should only be produced in our studio. Il est vrai que nous sommes entrain de faire « grandir » Gainax notamment pour que ce projet puisse être réalisé entièrement par notre société. It is true that we are spirits to "grow" Gainax to include this project can be fully realized by our company.

> 5 - Did you create the design of Rei Ayanami as this character would have much impact?
> Non, on espère toujours que notre travail soit réussi et apprécié par un plus grand nombre. No, we always hope that our work is successful and appreciated by many. On m'avait demandé de faire un personnage assez sombre. I was asked to make a rather bleak. A vrai dire ce personnage a été inspiré d'une chanson assez populaire au japon qui parle d'une jeune fille toujours entouré de bandelette. In fact this character was inspired by a song very popular in Japan that speaks of a young girl always surrounded by strip.

> I think Production I.G's Yoshiki Sakurai sums it up best.
>> "Influences or copying could be seen commonly within Japanese anime itself as well. Evangelion succeeded in utilitating and expressing the situation. It was, as it is often said, FULL of parodies and influences or sometimes even exact copies (on purpose of course) from some scenes of various anime, manga and Japanese modern novels and WW2 warship names etc etc etc not to mention the Bible. Anno-san himself says it was a huge collage of past works.
>> The older generations who understood the original, enjoyed the parody. Younger generations who didn't know, enjoyed the piece as it is. The brilliant ballance of Evangelion is that it could be enjoyed both ways. "
