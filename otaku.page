# Otaku no Video
## The bright side
## the dark side

The remarkable thing about _Otaku_ is that at the breaks, it switches from the anime to short filmed videos with various otaku (Gainax staffers)

# EoE & TV are the same ending

> How does that make any sense? In the movies Shinji rejects instrumentality, in the series he embraces it. The two story lines are mutually exclusive. Or have I missed something completely? It has been a while...

I think you missed something. I've always regarded the 2 endings as complementary, not contradictory.

Obviously EoE is about external events, action; and obviously the TV is about internal events, introspection. But the TV's action matches up with EoE's action (the Misato and Ritsuko bodies, for example), so we might expect the introspection to match up as well.

I won't trouble you with excerpts from the script (as this is an old Eva argument, it's been done before and better), but go back and look at the [Episode 26 synopsis](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Episode_26#Synopsis). Notice how the whole episode is about Shinji coming to grip with how it's better to exist, and exist as a separate person. The episode (the entire series) is consistently skeptical about the value & desirability of Instrumentality:

> In fact, she and other characters say, it’s true for all humanity, this weakness. It’s why Instrumentality is taking place. Humans cannot live alone, but yet they are separate entities: thus conflict and pain is created. Humans cannot live but in Instrumentality. "Really?" asks the text.

Or the final moments are quite telling:

> After seeing this, Shinji realizes that there are alternate possibilities to his Shinji decides that he can learn to love himself, and he wants to be "me" and to stay "here". The dark world shatters, and Shinji is left standing atop a coral reef under a sunny sky, surrounded by most of the other characters. He is wished "Congratulations!" by the human cast (and a squawking Pen Pen), and smiles, thanking everyone.

If he's accepted Instrumentality, then who is doing the congratulating, who being congratulated, and for what?

Specific plot points aside, why would the two endings be contradictory? Most people accept that part of the reason for the TV ending's experimental techniques (or crappiness, for some) was due to budget and internal Gainax issues. Why would Anno have the budget and time to do EoE, and decide to do an ending exactly opposite the one they wanted to do but couldn't? (Don't say Anno's revenge; that is untenable) If Shakespeare could go rewrite _Hamlet_ again with an unlimited SFX budget, would he suddenly decide to rewrite it to have a contradictory ending (maybe one where everyone lives)? Of course not. There's a particular artistic viewpoint being expressed - it does not allow for casual flip-flops. If the TV ending really is an acceptance of Instrumentality, then it renders everything *meaningless*, all the fighting and scheming and suffering and attempts by characters to come to grips with themselves.

Or, Instrumentality is consistently pursued by SEELE - an immoral group of powerful manipulative men. Shouldn't we distrust anything sought by the likes of *them*?

'Running away' describes Instrumentality exactly; are we supposed to think, 'hey, Shinji was right all along, and not being cowardly and immature'?

Seeing both endings as rejections of Instrumentality and an embrace of reality fit exactly with the constant message of the series ('We cannot weave our lives only out of things we like'), and fits exactly the 'Eva-as-otaku-therapy' paradigm I personally subscribe to.

So: seeing the endings as covering the same end is what Occam's Razor suggests; it makes most sense artistically; it makes sense from a production standpoint; it consiles with what we understand of Anno's inspirations and pre-Eva life; it's what a straightforward plot reading suggests; and so on. (We *could* argue against or ignore all that, but I hope I've shown any such argument would be quite strained.) I feel if you rewatch with all these points in mind, you'll change your mind as well.

---


Well, it seems you have to be alive to be in Instrumentality. Consider that in EoE, we don't see Kaji or Misato or Ritsuko or Rei or anyone we know for certain to be dead after the end. We see Misato's cross nailed to a makeshift grave, suggesting Shinji is certain she's gone.

And the only other person to reform out of the LCL is Asuka, who we last saw inside a half-eaten Eva - but not dead for certain. Eva are pretty tough, and the only pilots who die are ones who activate the self-destruct or whose capsules are pulled out and *then* crushed. It doesn't seem implausible that the harpies munching on Eva-02 caused Asuka extraordinary suffering but didn't actually manage to kill her before they became busy helping Shinji start Third Impact.

In the TV series, we don't see the external results, so we can't point to the ending. But definitely in the TV (and maybe EoE, I forget), the images of Misato/Rei/etc. specifically say that they are the public personas, the masks, the versions of them inside Shinji's mind, the Misatos that he knows - and not the 'real' ones. Hence, there's no mystery how people like Kaji could show up at the Congratulations!, as his mind can work off memories.

(On a side-note, one of the interesting things about Eva is that there may *not* be anything like an eternal soul! Yes, surprisingly, for all the mention of souls, Eva/Anno seem to use the term more or less interchangeably with mortal minds. There's never any real suggestion of an afterlife for souls, and Yui's desire to make an eternal mark or monument to humanity doesn't make much sense if souls were eternal. Further, the additional backstory added by the 'Secret Information' of the PS2 game is very atheistic - Lilith and Adam are just panspermia projects set up by ancient aliens.)

So, who is being congratulated? Shinji. Who is congratulating him? The personas in his mind, perhaps, or maybe Instrumentality itself, or maybe his mother (Yui is almost always off-screen, yet her concern that Shinji grow up and deal with his issues still comes through loud and clear in her characterization), or maybe himself in general. It isn't clear & doesn't really matter (none of those choices affects the meaning, I think) - the point is that Shinji has made the right choice, the choice that isn't running away, the choice that will let him walk by himself into whatever future there is, the choice that isn't fleeing into an anime-like fantasy world (again, the Eva-as-otaku-therapy theory works perfectly), that isn't weaving his life only out of things he likes. Where is he being congratulated? That's pretty clearly in his head. The floating island is unreal, even if we ignore EoE's depiction of a ruined bloody world.

# Eva is meaningless
> I'll give you a simpler Occam's Razor: Anno went off the deep end, and he ruined what otherwise was a good series; in fact, what could have been one of the greatest anime series ever.

I don't really see how that's a simpler hypothesis: you're proposing that a radical one-time change (Anno going off the deep end for just the TV ending) is simpler than the null hypothesis (Anno tried to do the same thing in both works)?

And I don't entirely think the ending makes sense on a plot level. The whole Angels business is ill thought out. The creators are constantly dancing and retconning in the series and movies, trying to make the plot-level hold together.

(They fail, of course; the 'Secret Information' plot data from the PS2 game even finally admits that some of the Angels were headed for Lilith, some for Adam, and some had no plan in mind - which is a transparently failed plot. Anno had a good deal to do with the SI, so I take that section as him basically saying 'the explanation is that there is no explanation; stop obsessing about it'.)

So in that sense it doesn't translate well onto celluloid. The simple approach would simply be to write an essay on how it's painful to exist, quote some Buddhism, some existentialism, and maybe Schopenhauer on the Hedgehog's Dilemma. But would that speak to otaku? No, not really. It might speak to philosophers, but they wouldn't need such an essay. How do you animate those ideas, get people to relate to them? How would you put those ideas into character form, what sort of story do you write?

Why then am I so interested in a failure? Because while it's a failure on the level of straight mecha - a series like RahXephon is infinitely better as mecha, or the better Gundams are clearly superior even if Eva can boast novel organic mecha designs - it's most definitely not a failure on the psychological/philosophical levels. In my other comments I mention my Eva-as-otaku-therapy theory. What Eva does so brilliantly is diagnose the otaku condition (the alienation, the apathy, the unhappiness and pain of it), how it is the general human condition, and the painful solution. It does so throughout the series, and does so thoroughly while creating characters that *last*. (What other characters from 1995 are so memorable and vital 14 years later? Why do Rei/Misato/Asuka capture their archetypes so perfectly?) The poison slides into the otaku stomach pleasantly, with plenty of fan service, until suddenly the ill-adjusted otaku realizes he is on the couch with Anno hm-hming.

Other Gainax series are like this: _Otaku no Video_ for example mixes its glorification of otaku with disconcerting video segments; FLCL is another. Outside of Gainax, therapy anime are rare but often quite good; _Serial Experiments Lain_ and _Welcome to the N.H.K.!_ come to mind. (_Genshiken_ does not; it whitewashes and glorifies otaku with only token criticisms.)

If your time was wasted watching it, then perhaps you should feel *glad* about that - glad that you didn't need it. (Some people do; remember the ['Death threats'](http://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats)? Read the translations and note how many of them speak of how the viewer saw themselves in Eva; consider why they sent them, and why Gainax selected them to be shown.)

### EoE: Anno's Revenge
<http://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats>

The initial reaction to EoE is bafflement. The viewer is repulsed when Shinji masturbates to a comatose Asuka. NERV staffers are butchered, non-combatants massacred. The montages are explicit and disturbing. Misato's kiss of Shinji either incestuous or pedophilia. Asuka's defeat is gory & wince-inducing. Ritsuko simply fails and is shot out of hand, the viewer deprived of any closure. (What *did* Gendo say to her?) Some scenes are simply obscene - when Eva 01 thrusts out of the giant Rei's eye, with all the eyeball-fluid spilling that implies, I simply had to look away. The rotting Rei chunks that set the background for the last scene are eery. The ending is famously inclusive; we know nothing of what will happen to Asuka & Shinji now and it's unclear what connection there is to the TV ending (which might have confused us, but the 'Congratulations!' thing at least fits some sort of ending pattern).

We might be bothered by other aspects. The occasional live-action sequence with 3 Japanese women/girls staring at us, the enigmatic dream-playground sequence (just to cite one), what's really going on - all these seem to defy a coherent analysis. Not for nothing has Eva its reputation of being a labyrinth in which fans are devoured by the minotaur of obsession.

This almost seems deliberate. Indeed, any viewer could see this, so surely the man who conceived it and executed it must see how unacceptable this all is. But he did it anyway. Why? Anno must be deliberately seeking to displease the viewer. Why? Well...

We search for a motive, and we find that the end of the TV was greeted with a firestorm. It was nothing like anyone had expected, nor did they understand what they had gotten. As the quip about academia goes, the smaller the stakes the more vicious the fights. Even better, EoE supplies a ready-made reason for Anno to want to punish viewers: shots of death threat graffiti and email ("Anno, I'll kill you!!!").

Case closed, then? Death threats are quite serious and from what I know of Japan, even rarer than in America. One could forgive a man for being disturbed and angered that his work could excite homicidal hatred.

But then, the graffiti and email weren't the only material depicted. There were a good 24 frames flashed, with about 11 or 12 different responses.

Consider letter 1. It is displayed 3 times in varying formats, and reads in part:

> I'm a middle school student like Shinji. First of all, I saw Eva and now it seems like I truly recognize myself, and this feeling is because of Eva. I want to say thank you for this. Why do I say this? To explain it would take a while, but Shinji and I are alike; depressed and helpless and introverted. I remember watching Eva and seeing Shinji being worried and troubled and I felt the same in my heart. In "EVA", there was an analysis that said how Shinji couldn't run away from the pain or the unpleasant feelings that were attached, and I have felt like this way too....
> In the last scene on TV, Shinji accepts everyone and they all congratulate him; that was a very nice end and I felt very happy....
> I'm worried about what will happen to Shinji in the movie (but I like the last scene on the TV series a lot). And thanks to EVA, I've started like myself and that has made me very happy....Mr. Anno, please keep working on EVA a lot more....and thank you so much for everything!!

Or the second letter:

> I also felt inside myself the same excitement that Shinji felt.
The last scenes made me appreciate my own existence even more.

Letter three:

> Thanks to Mr. Anno and all the staff for helping to liberate our hearts and souls, and for all of these feelings. Thank you very much.

Another letter:

> Shinji's falls into despair and Asuka's arrogance appears to be some sort of escape from the darkness in her heart. These people have difficulties in dealing with their feelings; and so in their own ways -- Shinji by totally collapsing and falling apart, and Asuka by letting her arrogance cover up her inner weakness -- they each work towards the same goal: to come to terms with themselves.

One last one:

> I could feel the pain of the TV series again. I could feel inside my heart the feelings inside Hideaki Anno's heart. So in my heart, I sympathized with "I'm not alone. To feel loneliness is better." I still feel a strange sensation even after watching the movie, because of these two opposite feelings mixing in myself. I'm waiting for the summer to see "End of Evangelion", and I know that that will be even more painful, but I will feel happy and enjoy it. I don't think that there are many people who feel this way, but in my case, EVA made me think about myself and was like a mirror of myself.

Think about what Anno chose to show. Of the many thousands of messages they must have received, he chose to show 4 times one from a depressed student like Shinji who has come to feel better about himself; another who identified with Shinji; a message of gratitude simply for the healing; some analysis of the psychological issues of the 2 most important characters; an analysis & application to himself; and some death threats.

Is it more plausible that Anno was so angered by the 2 death threats that he abandoned whatever vision he had, than that the 2 threats were chosen to be contrasts with the others?

Most of the messages were healthy responses. The writer grew or learned in some way. Eva was not mere entertainment for them.

The death threats were pathological responses; to care that much about Eva, one must be deeply attracted to it, sense that it says something about oneself. I could not care less about whether some telenovela series goes off the rails, because it says nothing to me; but if I were watching a series that I identified deeply with, that I felt expressed the things I valued as no series before had, and by the end, it had called my life a crippled shell, my ideals hollow and false, and urged me to become something else entirely before it was too late, something I have spent years eluding - then a equally deep sense of betrayal is to be expected. There is no apathetic response to such a challenge. Either the viewer can accept the diagnosis and strive for healing, or he can reject it utterly. A therapist is always in danger from his patient.

# Why the plot is unimportant

Let's not mince words: Eva's plot is incoherent. There is no getting around this. One of the most frequent assessments is that it is post-modern in its eclecticism, or that it is "the remix anime":
     "Evangelion carries a large number of quotes from and references to other anime productions, such as the mecha designs of Ultraman, Space Battleship Yamato, and Gundam. The works of Go Nagai  such as Mazinga Z  and even the novelist Ryu Murakami are also referred to; in particular, Devilman is seen as a major source for the overall plot. This was so apparent that Evangelion became known as "the remixed anime". pg 9 of Fujie 2004

It is comprised of hoary tropes and devices from earlier mecha and fiction in general; the subversions have been often remarked upon & considered to be what is important (eg. Napier), but even more were played straight (consider the list of identified elements by TvTropes http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeonGenesisEvangelion and how many of them are *not* subversions) Anno is explicit about this recycling:
    "There is no longer room for absolute originality in the field of anime, especially given that our generation was brought up on mass-produced anime. All stories and techniques inevitably bring with them a sense of déjà vu. The only avenue of expression left open to us is to produce a collage-like effect based on a sampling of existing works."  Fujie 2004
The level of recycling can be seen in comparison with another mecha series: _RahXephon_ (2002). The similarities are so numerous that anyone who has seen them both must remark on them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RahXephon#Neon_Genesis_Evangelion and the similarities can be traced down scene-by-scene (see http://evaxephon.com/ ) but many of the similarities are drawing on common sources: _Megazone 23_ for the false Tokyo, _Yamato_ for the alien invasion, _Devilman_ for the cosmic conflict and vague souls and humanity's inferiority
    The overall design of Evangelion calls to mind Devilman by Go Nagai. In fact, the whole concept of the Evas, which are made from Adam, and harbor the souls of humans, can be considered borrowed from scenes from Devilman, where the soul of Akira Fudo is possessed by Amon, the Lord of War. Moreover, the heavily religious undertones, the suggestion of conflict with an indigenous people, and the cosmic view that mankind may not be the ultimate being all owe something to Devilman." pg 76 of Fujie 2004
and so on. Even an incomplete list of allusions & borrowings runs into the dozens. In this respect, Eva is remiscent of the first Gainax videos, the DAICON convention videos; the videos include literally hundreds of characters and decades after their production, many remain unidentified (see one attempt to catalogue & identify them by going frame-by-frame http://www.anime-classic.net/AC/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=DaiconWiki )
Who could possibly appreciate such a work? Only a fellow otaku. To have not seen the relevant predecessors is to be unable to watch Eva fully. It would be like reading Shakespeare or Milton while utterly ignorant of classical history & myth. Something will come through, but how much?
Many subcultures prize works that are obscure to outsiders. Shibboleths keep the rabble out. By making Eva inscrutable to your average TV watcher, Anno speaks to the otaku alone and receives their attention. If you think Eva was popularly understandable, then why is Anno so concerned to 'dumb down', as it were, the _Rebuild_ fans?
    As the creator of this project, [I assure you that] a very new-feeling Evangelion world has beeen constructed. For this purpose, we are not returning to our roots at Gainax.... In closing, it is also our job to provide a service to our customers. Although it seems obvious, we aim to create a form of entertainment that anyone can look forward to; one that people who have never seen Evangelion can easily adjust to, one that can engage audiences as a movie for theatres, and one that produces a new understanding of the world. http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies

The subversion of tropes is not necessarily important. Many of the subversions or twists were already done. Shinji, for example, is far from the first reluctant or mentally disturbed mecha pilot - consider the pilots in _Space Runaway Ideon_, or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamille_Bidan in the 2nd Gundam - nor would he be the last (every other Gundam series). The important thing is that the audience knows where the creator is coming from, that quotes like "His erudition in tokusatsu is vast, and can be seen clearly in his animation work." are not PR fluff. That he remains one of them.
    "Primary diet consists of Sapporo Brand Barbecue Potato Chips and pizza with tomatoes as the only topping. After those comes beer. His erudition in tokusatsu is vast, and can be seen clearly in his animation work." - from the Gainax FAQ http://www.cjas.org/~leng/daihist.htm

The plot exists as a convenience to reach the necessary situations, and to earn otaku cred. Once the otaku have taken the bait and invested something of themselves in the series (think how hard it is to not finish a book you are half-way through), it is unnecessary, and almost abandoned by the last 2 episodes.
## The Un-Evas
We can convince ourselves further that the plot isn't important by looking at RahXephon. RX unquestionably had better animation; its music is competitive with Eva's; the critical response uniformly positive; the plot well-thought out from the beginning (with some critics specifically praising it as a "paragon of responsible storytelling (...) No loose strings are left; we see the conclusion of every characters storyline." http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=566 ); its Mesoamerican style quite as exotic as the Judeochristian symbolism in Eva; its goals apocalyptic, and so on. In many respects, it is RX and not Eva which deserves to be remembered and rewatched.
And yet - it was popular enough to merit a quasi-movie & a manga adaptation, but no more. When brought up by fans, discussion often centers (just as here) on its relation to Eva. Its influence on post-2002 anime indiscernible. No revival seems to be in the cards. Why? Why does it not have a cult following, or even any mindshare? (I see online obscure series like _Texhnolyze_ recommended long before anyone dredges RX from the depths.)
Another contrast might be the later Gainax work _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ (2007). Lagann is like Eva in being a mecha series focusing on a young orphan boy piloting an extraordinarily powerful mecha, but it shuns any thinking deeper than sloganeering ("Go beyond the impossible, and kick reason to the curb!"), and is content with being a collage anime which takes all the shonen mecha tropes and pushes them to their limits. I would call it satire, but that implies some desire for change, and the series is done with such affection & good humour that it is only ever entertaining. Lagann was, of course, a massive hit among otaku. (See also later Melancholy section)
I suggest that Eva represented a peculiar & perhaps unique mix of otaku catnip and psychological 'earworms' - analyses that pierce an otaku's heart, that he can't forget, that he circles around and must keep coming back to again and again ("Eva" is a story that repeats..." http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies ). Lagann provided the catnip, unadulterated by anything else, and so is successful. RX passed on the catnip for a more artistic path, but it had no earworm, and so once gone, returned no more.

otaku contrast with hikkomori? http://www.cjas.org/~leng/hikiko.htm


# Positive otakudom
## Haruhi
This theory is extensible further. One might wonder why _Haruhi_ was so extraordinarily popular when it came out. One can appeal to surface features, which exist in abundance. Haruhi is a well-designed character; her sidekicks are the epitome of moe or a fresh twist on the passive Rei archetype. The storyline is thoughtful, postmodern without being obnoxious, and often funny. The anime has a famously excellent opening, and the animation in general is top-notch. The voice actors nail their roles. The episode sequence is unique, and represents an ingenious work-around the source novels (I argue in [anime endings] that the 'Haruhi' random ordering creates a sensible dramatic arc). Kyon is himself a carefully modulated narrator, sarcastic without being negative, representing the viewer yet not too close. There was an existing fan-base from the light novels; the season had little competition. In general, everything went right. One should expect a fair degree of popularity.
But there's something missing there. When we compound our previous ingredients, the stew is insipid. What's the missing ingredient? It's the *optimism*. It's the sense of fun and wonder (the 'sensawunda' as TODO put it). The world is stranger than you imagine, but not in a despairing Lovecraftian way. The love of weirdness for its own sake, the search for novelty, these form the core of 'Haruhiism'. The club wears its motto on its sleeve: TODO "making the world more fun."
This is not the usual critical otaku narrative that we saw in _Evangelion_ or in _Welcome to the N.H.K._. There, we realize the sterility of otaku pursuits. Consider dating games: the endless permutations of hair style and eye color, even the doujinshi wearily pairing off the protagonist with each girl in the standard variations of sex, the fanart putting a particular character through its paces: in a _yukata_ watching fireworks, in a bathrobe at the _onsen_, hanging out on the school roof, etc. The combinations are monstrous. Where are we to find soul or meaning in the Library of Borges?
A fan has an essentially closed universe. He has abdicated his freedom to strike off on his own in new directions. He is one of many, but still alone: the esthetic experience is still alone. He may hide his unhappiness, may throw himself into his pursuits, but he is still empty. The many critiques of modern man apply to him in double measure. He is no New Type.
This sad truth isn't always the truth. There are fans who are empowered to do new things. One thinks of the early works of Gainax, the DAICON videos. There's love in every frame of them, excitement at something new. Consider _Otaku no Video_: we can see despair in the live-action segments, particularly in the segment about the video collector. But the animated segments offer us hope: salvation through creation. The 2 protagonists are not damned by their otaku life; they overcome it to become true fans, Otakings, creators of a commercial empire, and if we take the ending literally, they helm humanity's expansion to the stars - the dream of generations.
In a way, computers were the worst thing that ever happened to otaku. They made it tremendously easy to link up with other fans and plunge deeply into multiple communities, sapping fans of the will to do anything in particular. Is it an accident that the decline of the Space Age was just before the rise of the Personal Computer Age? If we had looked forward, we would have expected computers to help us travel to Mars and beyond. After all, as the old comment goes, we went to the Moon on the equivalent of a wrist-watch; how much more could we do with modern computers! Yet we are no longer even on the Moon. The ISS is already within sight of its final orbit. We contract. We become ever more introverted. Why bother with outer space, when we have inner space? An inner space/Internet exploding in detail, becoming ever more sophisticated and addictive. If Gainax were founded today, would its animators create whole shorts multiple minutes long, or would they be doing mashups of _Lucky Star_ with _Death Note_ to put on YouTube?
Haruhi wants the SOS-dan to go out and change the world. To make it more interesting - not to make a more interesting webpage. To have fun, and search for strange beings. That we are not gods who warp the world into possessing strange beings does not make Haruhi any less inspirational. When one watches a video of _Haruhi_ fans waiting on a line spontaneously doing the dance and instantly stopping when a quizzical policeman walks by, this is the spirit of Haruhiism at work. When large red Hs appear mysteriously, this is Haruhiism too. When Improv Everywhere stages another mass event - they may never have heard of Haruhi, but that is Haruhiism too. When hackers discover some vibrators hooked up to a compass grant one a 6th sense, is this not Haruhiism too? When SpaceX launches a rocket into space - and not a social network site into an IPO - is this not Haruhiism too?

From the Kotaku message board from whence this post originates:

Why can’t young men wed anymore? I think it is because men can no longer say to women, ‘I can always protect you,’ in this dog-eat-dog world of restructurings and layoffs – such words are now unreal.

Women as a result now target two groups of men: “ikemen” (handsome, cool men), and rich men, the so-called ‘Hills tribe’ (referring to the ultra-prestigious Roppongi Hills residential tower).

But most men have neither money nor good looks, and as a result women will no longer consider them. Surprisingly, I’ve heard of cases where a chosen man will end up dating dozens or hundreds of women.

Since the ikemen and the rich monopolise the women, all that remains is a sterile desert, where normal men can no longer find a partner, so they flee to Akihabara and find love in the arms of an anime character.

"I read in an old animation magazine "Animefantastic" IIRC, an article by J. Lamplighter, that Gainax/Anno had some influence on the ADV TV dub for special vocabulary, & had to approve what was done before it could be printed."

"The question of what worked and what didn't therefore doesn't seem a pertinent one to me; to me the show is about dysfunctionality: of the artist, of his creation, and of his artistic attempts to phrase and portray that creation. If Evangelion "worked" it would be Gasaraki or Brain Powerd. Less flippantly, it might be Gundam or Getta Robo G. But what would have been the point of making them again?"

"We've seen instances, from Anno in interviews, to the pseudo-exposes of Otaku no Video, to comments by people we know, that they eventually got tired of the grinding unreality of anime, which became quite as oppressive as the grinding reality they thought to escape by becoming an otaku. The problem with that explanation for me is that I don't believe one ever escapes from reality, the challenges of existence, the issues of having been born into this world: of being a human being.
Rejecting the otaku and his works isn't going to teach you how to see, any more than the rigorous motions of otaku culture will make you go blind. Upon embarking upon his post-Eva project KareKano, Anno remarked as an epigram for the show that "reality has no mercy". He based his approach to the series in large part by talking to students in contemporary Japanese high schools: trying to restore the conversation he had cut off when he was their age."

"The complaint may certainly have some validity within Gainax itself. Anno himself foresaw this in "What Were We Trying To Make Here?", when he said, "I know my behavior was thoughtless, troublesome and arrogant. But I tried. I don't know what the result will be, because I don't know where life is taking the staff of the production. I feel that I am being irresponsible. But it's only natural that we should synchronize ourselves with the world within the production." The synch rate wasn't always 100%. Masayuki, Kazuya Tsurumaki, and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto had their own ideas; Ikuto Yamashita, the man most responsible for the distinctive mechanical designs of Evangelion, had his detailed scenario for how the story should end (it would have involved the "emergence" of the Eva units).

"Well. I think that the world of animation is cyclic and has not evolved much for 20 years. At the time, the large madness was around Zeta Gundam, and 20 years later, Gundam is in the news and very popular. With regard to Newtype, I will say that you do not have to be concerned. As long as there will be series of popular animation, the magazine will continue to exist. However, I think that the industry rests too much on large successes like Gundam, which you could call the "Old Type," which is a little annoying with a magazine which is called Newtype. As I said earlier, the world of animation follows a regular cycle. The cover of the 10th anniversary issue was Evangelion, the cover of 20th is Gundam-- thus it is logical that the cover of the 30th will again be Evangelion. You’d better reserve it as of now."

"Twelve years is enough time for you to be able to look back on earlier works obvjectively", he explains. "Shortly before we started this project, Anno had a big Eva marathon where he watched the whole series in one go.
The first thing he said when he finished watching was, 'This show really is interesting, isn't it? I never realized how interesting it was'. That comment really shook me."'
'The complexity has been somewhat lessened to make it more accesible to newbies, but it'll still take a bit of thought to understand." Otsuki adds that they're removing much of the deliberate obfuscation that made Eva infamous: "Filling works with difficult works and concepts in order to create confusion among viewers was a good technique 12 years ago, but not anymore, and one of our primary goals for this project is to turn everyone's expectations upside down."'

"We got to the last two episodes and were so utterly confused, we didn't know what to make of it.  At the time I was upset with the ending, and felt cheated.

Over the next year, I watched the series numerous times, read every explanation I could find, combed fan sites, forums, anything I could take in to understand the ending.   I don't think it was until  I spoke with Matt Greenfield at a panel at Otakon 2001 that I finally understood.  I rewatched the show, and it all made a newfound sense.  The catharsis, the introspection, it all resonated within myself.  I cannot say when it began, but it was an epiphany that would become more and more apparent and integral within myself.  I felt very much like Shinji at the very end of the series a little more each day.  My depression faded, the apathy waned, and I began to find a respect for myself.

It seems odd to say that a "cartoon" is what helped you cope with feelings of depression and suicide, but its true.  I can not say for certain whether I would still be alive, had I not been exposed to the show.  Its a very strange notion, one I've had trouble coming to terms with myself, and one I try very hard to convey to others, but its hard when its so personal. "

"Their best original works--Yamaga's Royal Space Force, Takeshi Mori's Otaku no Video, Kazuya Tsurumaki's FLCL, and Anno's Evangelion--display Gainax's odd inside-out paradox of being super-obsessed fans who, through their meditations, nevertheless sometimes come to enlightenment about the nature of themselves, their medium, their industry, their times, and their world."

Evidence of constant retconning:
"Recent remarks by Gendo and Fuyutsuki of NERV seem intriguingly to confirm that certain details of the Angels differ in this version of events. Although the first Angel to appear, Sachiel [in Stages 1-5], had been previously assumed to be the Third Angel as so coded in the anime, it is now suggested that in this version of events it was actually the Second. Fuyutsuki commented that the Angel Sahaquiel [Stage 30]--the Tenth Angel as coded in the anime--was actually "[number] seven," to which Gendo replied, "Yes. And five remain." According to this differing classification, then, the Third Angel would be Shamshel [Stages 9-10], the Fourth, Ramiel [Stages 15-19], the Fifth, Gaghiel [Stage 20], and the Sixth, Israfel [Stage 22-26]. Note that the Angels Sandalphon and Matarael--the Eighth and Ninth respectively--have not appeared in this version of events, as they did in the anime where they followed Israfel and preceded Sahaquiel."

"However, its violence and surrealism will not be new to those who have seen the TV show; neither will its view of a society of broken souls, where men and women are grains of flying sand, blasting each other to bone. Playwright Kenji Sato, who does not like Evangelion, compares it to Nine Inch Nails' album The Downward Spiral; it is an excellent comparison, and I agree, except that I like Eva. It's only a cartoon; it's only a life."
"The End's main characters are a man and a woman, Shinji and Asuka, and director Hideaki Anno when he does not present himself through Misato, Gendo, or every other character in the series identifies with them both (gossip links him romantically with Asuka's voice actress, Yuko Miyamura). As Anno explained at the outset of the series, in an essay reprinted this month in Viz's collected Book One of the Evangelion manga, he began this because he felt sick, and the final line of The End, spoken by Asuka back to Shinji, could not put things any more plain."
"This is The End of Evangelion. It is the same ending as that of the television series. It is told big-budget, stitched with bullets, limned with guts, and tagged with blood, in case it was too subtle the first time. But it is the same ending. You will see all this: a man, stunted in emotion, has a special gift within him. He can move his human hands and feet with the stride and reach of a giant. Because he knew love once, and lost it, he sketched one map on his floor where he stood and one in the sky above, until he had drawn between them a world of mysteries and wonders, a world of things to love and of those in love. But when they put their hands towards him, he drew away; when he put his hands on them, they were cold and still. In his frustration, he tightened his grip to take satisfaction by force: a load shot to nowhere, a stranglehold on beauty, clenched fists battering down his creation, until there was nothing left but himself again."

> By breaking with the long-standing tradition of basing their animated works on pre-existing stories and folk tales, GAINAX has been credited with freeing animation from the constraints which have allowed it to be perceived as a derivative medium. In so doing, they have established animated film as a self-sufficient art form (Time Magazine, November 22, 1999).
