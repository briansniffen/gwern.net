This theory is extensible further. One might wonder why _Haruhi_ was so extraordinarily popular when it came out. One can appeal to surface features, which exist in abundance. Haruhi is a well-designed character; her sidekicks are the epitome of moe or a fresh twist on the passive Rei archetype. The storyline is thoughtful, postmodern without being obnoxious, and often funny. The anime has a famously excellent opening, and the animation in general is top-notch. The voice actors nail their roles. The episode sequence is unique, and represents an ingenious work-around the source novels (I argue in [anime endings] that the 'Haruhi' random ordering creates a sensible dramatic arc). Kyon is himself a carefully modulated narrator, sarcastic without being negative, representing the viewer yet not too close. There was an existing fan-base from the light novels; the season had little competition. In general, everything went right. One should expect a fair degree of popularity.
But there's something missing there. When we compound our previous ingredients, the stew is insipid. What's the missing ingredient? It's the *optimism*. It's the sense of fun and wonder (the 'sensawunda' as TODO put it). The world is stranger than you imagine, but not in a despairing Lovecraftian way. The love of weirdness for its own sake, the search for novelty, these form the core of 'Haruhiism'. The club wears its motto on its sleeve: TODO "making the world more fun."
This is not the usual critical otaku narrative that we saw in _Evangelion_ or in _Welcome to the N.H.K._. There, we realize the sterility of otaku pursuits. Consider dating games: the endless permutations of hair style and eye color, even the doujinshi wearily pairing off the protagonist with each girl in the standard variations of sex, the fanart putting a particular character through its paces: in a _yukata_ watching fireworks, in a bathrobe at the _onsen_, hanging out on the school roof, etc. The combinations are monstrous. Where are we to find soul or meaning in the Library of Borges?
A fan has an essentially closed universe. He has abdicated his freedom to strike off on his own in new directions. He is one of many, but still alone: the esthetic experience is still alone. He may hide his unhappiness, may throw himself into his pursuits, but he is still empty. The many critiques of modern man apply to him in double measure. He is no New Type.
This sad truth isn't always the truth. There are fans who are empowered to do new things. One thinks of the early works of Gainax, the DAICON videos. There's love in every frame of them, excitement at something new. Consider _Otaku no Video_: we can see despair in the live-action segments, particularly in the segment about the video collector. But the animated segments offer us hope: salvation through creation. The 2 protagonists are not damned by their otaku life; they overcome it to become true fans, Otakings, creators of a commercial empire, and if we take the ending literally, they helm humanity's expansion to the stars - the dream of generations.
In a way, computers were the worst thing that ever happened to otaku. They made it tremendously easy to link up with other fans and plunge deeply into multiple communities, sapping fans of the will to do anything in particular. Is it an accident that the decline of the Space Age was just before the rise of the Personal Computer Age? If we had looked forward, we would have expected computers to help us travel to Mars and beyond. After all, as the old comment goes, we went to the Moon on the equivalent of a wrist-watch; how much more could we do with modern computers! Yet we are no longer even on the Moon. The ISS is already within sight of its final orbit. We contract. We become ever more introverted. Why bother with outer space, when we have inner space? An inner space/Internet exploding in detail, becoming ever more sophisticated and addictive. If Gainax were founded today, would its animators create whole shorts multiple minutes long, or would they be doing mashups of _Lucky Star_ with _Death Note_ to put on YouTube?
Haruhi wants the SOS-dan to go out and change the world. To make it more interesting - not to make a more interesting webpage. To have fun, and search for strange beings. That we are not gods who warp the world into possessing strange beings does not make Haruhi any less inspirational. When one watches a video of _Haruhi_ fans waiting on a line spontaneously doing the dance and instantly stopping when a quizzical policeman walks by, this is the spirit of Haruhiism at work. When large red Hs appear mysteriously, this is Haruhiism too. When Improv Everywhere stages another mass event - they may never have heard of Haruhi, but that is Haruhiism too. When hackers discover some vibrators hooked up to a compass grant one a 6th sense, is this not Haruhiism too? When SpaceX launches a rocket into space - and not a social network site into an IPO - is this not Haruhiism too?
