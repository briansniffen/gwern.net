description: Anthology of Gainax/Anno/Evangelion quotes, sources, references, and analyses
...

Date is whenever a source was *created*, not when it was *published* or otherwise disseminated.

1. Primary is material from someone who worked on a object of interest: eg. Hideaki Anno or Hiroyuki Yamaga. (I include Japanese seiyuu because as Asuka's last line shows, they have direct input, or as Ritsuko's last line shows, special insight.)
2. Secondary is a source from someone who knows Primaries first-hand: eg. Carl Horn or Toshio Okada.
3. Tertiary is any source further removed than that - mainstream news coverage, academic analysis, fan speculation & analysis etc.: eg. Mari Kotani, David Samuels, Aaron Clark.

Source is based on the ultimate origins of information, not proximate; an email forwarding an anonymous fan translation of a Anno interview in a Japanese book is considered primary, not tertiary. Some people or materials shift statuses; eg. Carl Horn is sometimes recording Anno (primary), statements by Hiroyuki Yamaga (secondary), or his own interpretations (tertiary). It is usually clear which classification applies best.

> Animage: What would you recommend?
>
> Anno: Shows like Yamato or Gundam (1979, TV) which have soul, emit the staff's "cry of mind" out of the screens as a certain vibration. On the other hand, I feel bad when I watch shows that are made sluggishly without such soul.
>
...
> Anno: Of the movies, I recommend Gundam III - Meeting in Space. The picture is quite nice. Moreover, if I have to recommend Mr. Tomino's animation, I would choose Legendary Giant IDEON (1980, TV). It would be best to watch the movie version's Part II (1982, movie) after watching the TV series. Although some of the picture quality might be poor, please tolerate it.
>
...
> Anno: Yes, I did, although it is a little bit light. I was just overwhelmed by its adult mood throughout the animation. I can't express such mood yet. Actually, I felt sad when I watched Nadia, which I directed, soon after watching it. I felt Nadia was too childish. (laughs)

> "We had no trouble starting up another project right away. All the outside staff we had hired for _Aoki Uru_ were now gone, but Anno and the rest were still there. They went on a retreat to Matsumoto in Nagano and before you knew it, they had a project plan all drawn up. Still, it would take over a year to go from project start to broadcast.
> Anno had been running on empty ever since _Nadia_ finished, but _Evangelion_ seemed to be just the thing to get him up and running again. And once he puts his mind to something, he goes all out..."

### Early Evangelion

#### Project Meeting

>" *Preliminary Meeting*
>
> [Theme]
>
> Before the birth of the human race, there twice existed prehistoric civilizations with advanced technology. The first civilization (the First Ancestral Race) created the EVA, but because of this they were destroyed. The next civilization (the Second Ancestral Race) created the Spears of Longinus, thus successfully containing the EVA; afterwards, as a countermeasure to anyone reviving the EVA, they planted Angels all over the world.
>
> [Analysis]
>
> At this stage EVA are not to be considered "man-made", but beings resurrected by the Ancestral Races. Hence, the Angels exist largely to destroy the EVA and remove traces of their presence in the case of their revival. However, it goes without saying that very similar themes are to be found in some of Director Anno's works such as "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind" and "Nadia". Ancient civilizations that boasted great technology are a typical theme found in Science Fiction anime. At this stage, it is difficult to imagine works with the same level or originality and complexity coming after EVA."

#### Evangelion Proposal

> Also, in the Eva production timeline in the Collectors BoxSet, Anno proposed the first in-house draft of "Evangelion" to Gainax for consideration on September 20, 1993 -- over two years before the start of the series.
>
> The Series Plan (2nd draft) and plot/synopsis of all 26 episodes was submitted on January 5 of the following year (1994), and for the most part "fixed" (in-house) the following month on February 4.  The Planning Draft for external distribution was completed in April of that same year -- a year and a half before the start of the series.
>
> Production work for Ep.1 was completed in April 1995, and Ep.2 in May 1995, but the opening and ending sequences were not finished until September.

In actuality, they are ancient relics that were left sleeping all around the world by prehistoric lifeforms called the First Ancestral Race [!!!]. There are 28 in all.

> What is meant by "The Human Complementary Plan," a plan to save mankind from despair?
>
> Mankind has already obtained the power to antagonize God. This is the basis of this story and the great international project known as "The Human Complementary Plan." Half a century ago, we developed nuclear fusion. Next up for mankind, who can store the sun in the palm of his hand, is a complementary plan to create the "perfect human" with their own hands. The goal is to liberate all of mankind by scientifically re-creating "the tree of life" forbidden by God, by taking away "death" from man, and by freeing him from the original sin and the curse that plagues him. The one who is advocating and recommending this plan is Gendo Ikari, the father of the main character. Through "artificial evolutionary research," he is single-mindedly pursuing the form of a human who has achieved the ultimate evolution…

  --<http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_Proposal_%28Translation%29#Page_13_.28Human_Instrumentality_Project.29>

> Specially educated and trained from the beginning as an exclusive operator. A determined girl who is apt to stretch herself depending on the situation. Hobby is playing video games. Hates to lose and hates boys. Aspires only to be like Kaji. Quarter Japanese, also has German-American blood. Step mother lives in Germany (her father passed away).

  --<http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_Proposal_(Translation)#Page_13_.28Human_Instrumentality_Project.29>; note that in episode 23, Asuka holes up in Hikari's room playing video games ('HIKARI (MONO): She won't go to school and she won't go back home. She just keeps playing games.'). in _Rebuild 2.0_ trailer, Asuka whips out a handheld to play. TODO: how much does she play in the movie?

> [Gendo:] Gradually becoming fixated on the research itself and turning into a digitalized human who justifies any means in order to achieve the goal. Believes his plan will form a utopia bringing true equality to all people.

  --<http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_Proposal_(Translation)#Page_13_.28Human_Instrumentality_Project.29>

> [Toji] Father works for the research center.
>
> ...[Kensuke] Father is a civil worker. (Mother passed away.)
>
> ...[Ryoji] Childish but very strict. Greatly influences Shinji's development.
>
> ...[PenPen] Created artificially by genetic manipulation. Intelligence of an infant. Usually resides in a large refrigerator. Loves to bathe in hot springs for some reason.

  --<http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_Proposal_(Translation)#Page_13_.28Human_Instrumentality_Project.29> Notes: PenPen has no name though he has the manga backstory (?), Keel Lorenz is described quite differently, nothing about Hikari or Toji's mother - but note that Kensuke's mother is dead

> Episode 13, 14, 16 -- I believe the translation for original planned episode 13 should say that defeat is expected because Shinji is more arrogant, not that Shinji expected defeat. If you think about the descriptions of these three episodes, you can see that most of it was compressed into Episode 16 in the series. -- Shinji gets a higher sync ratio than Asuka, so he becomes arrogant. He gets trapped inside the Eva (well trapped in the Eva in the Angel). There's a plan to rescue Shinji from Unit 1. Shinji has a conversation with an Angel.
>
> Episode 17 - Asuka's first date. The basis of this was used in Lies and Silence. Asuka does go on a date in that episode if we remember. Another translation that I *think* I am reading correctly; it should be Misato recalls *past episodes* not that she recalls her own past. In other words, the clip show would have been here.
>
> Episode 20 - NERV's birth - so the details changed, but it was still about the history of NERV
>
> Episode 21 - the underwater battle was moved to a different episode, and the character changed but there was still a mental attack from an Angel [Asuka instead of Shinji]
>
> ...
>
> Episode 25 - I believe what the translation should read here is that as the 12 most powerful Angels descend from the Moon, the UN dissolves Human Instrumentality to stop it and resolves to destroy the *Laboratory* because that's the reason the Angels/Apostles have been coming (I think "deciding on destruction" is referring to the first sentence where it says Arka is held by the Laboratory. After all, why would they dissolve the project and then continue attacking the Angels?] And this is pretty close to what happened in Episode 25' Air; they send in the troops to take over.

> GAINAX, the studio that created Gunbuster, was made up of fans who really--I mean really--knew anime. They were out to have as much fun with it as possible, and break a few boundaries while they were at it. They were the best anime has ever seen. Look at their short film that opened Daicon IV, following that up with the incredible four-minute ROYAL SPACE FORCE, the film that got them the funding for their masterpiece (and only feature film) THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE. With NADIA and GUNBUSTER, they demonstrated they could produce classics in the TV and OAV genres as well. In their coda, OTAKU NO VIDEO, they made anime's great _roman a clef_, closing the circle for anime fans and exiting in style.

>  "So why did Evangelion wind up with that shape?" I figure that from now on I will hear that question countless times. The director instructed me to make, "the image of a demon [_oni_]." A giant just barely under the control of mankind. I get the feeling I've seen that correlation before... The image I had for the design concept was the fairy tale, Gulliver's Travels. Enormous Power Restrained.

> [Yutaka] Izubuchi drew some design proposals on the Evangelions. Anno sent him instructions and rough sketches, and Izubuchi drew some designs. Izubuchi introduced one with four eyes like what unit 02 ended up having. We don't know how much his proposal influenced the final design though, since he's not credited for the final designs.
>
> ... I'd always thought Izubuchi had influenced the mecha (for lack of a better term) designs in Eva; there's a good deal of resemblance between the Eva-01 and Izubuchi's Kaempfer design from Gundam 0080, particularly around the head. Nice to see that there is actually some proof to back me up on this.

> In the end, Leiqunni's attempt to isolate herself from a world she regards as evil is no more productive than Shiro's initial refusal to even consider good and evil in the world (that's why I prefer to render his opening line as "I don't know if it's good or bad" although one could say "For better or worse"). HONNEAMISE is a film advocating anti-detachment.
>
> ... Yamaga has not merely jerked Shiro's strings to commit this act--indeed, the act derives from choice and serves to illustrate that Shiro *knows* he has a choice--Leiqunni believes *she has none.* Leiqunni believes in original sin, that "all are guilty." But if one is guilty from birth, the entire concept of "sin" as a choice becomes meaningless, for we are evil--indeed, doomed, by nature and can do nothing but ask for grace.
>
> But Shiro doesn't believe this is true. His prayer at the end comes only after a long string of conscious choices, actions, and decisions on his part. He prays not out of a belief that God's mercy is the only thing that can save the helplessly evil human race--on the contrary, his prayer is based on the careful observation of humanity's historical record: full of choices that led to slaughter. And yet, he simultaneously recognizes that the same human race has made it here, to "God's space"--what used to be thought of as Heaven. What he beseeches, then, is a light to mankind--"In our despair, give us one, fixed star." A beacon of *truth*--to remind us that we always have a *choice.*
>
> The more I look at HONNEAMISE, the more convinced I am that Yamaga knew what he was doing. The film holds with [Andre] Gide's warning: "Do not understand me too quickly." Whether the necessity for the viewer to go back again to fully comprehend it, will be a liability in its release here--I don't know--there is so much one can get from the first viewing only. But in that endurance, the viewer discovers that which endures: the art of THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE. The film is Yamaga's choice--and also, still, a light to anime--a genre that doesn't believe in itself as it should...

> And in that world, a 14-year-old boy shrinks from human contact.   And he tries to live in a closed world where his behavior dooms him, and he has abandoned the attempt to understand himself.  A cowardly young man who feels that his father has abandoned him, and so he has convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person, so much so that he cannot even commit suicide.
>
> And there is a 29-year-old woman who lives life so lightly as to barely allow the possibility of a human touch.  She protects herself by having suface level relationships, and running away.
>
> Both are extremely afraid of being hurt.  Both are unsuitable-lacking the positive attitude-for what people call heroes of an adventure.   But in any case, they are the heroes of this story.
>
> They say, "To live is to change."  I started this production with the wish that once the production complete, the world, and the heroes would change.  That was my "true" desire.  I tried to include everything of myself in Neon Genesis Evangelion-myself, a broken man who could do nothing for four years.  A man who ran away for four years, one who was simply not dead.   Then one thought.  "You can't run away," came to me, and I restarted this production.  It is a production where my only thought was to burn my feelings into film.  I know my behavior was thoughtless, troublesome, and arrogant.  But I tried.  I don't know what the result will be.  That is because within me, the story is not yet finished.  I don't know what will happen to Shinji, Misato or Rei.  I don't know where life will take them.  Because I don't know where life is taking the staff of the production.  I feel that I am being irresponsible.   But... But it's only natural that we should synchronize ourselves with the world within the production.  I've taken on a risk: "It's just an imitation."

> ..."By the way, Shinji's name came from a friend of mine.  Misato's name came from the hero of a manga.  The name Ritsuko came from a friend of mine in middle school.  I borrowed from everywhere.  Even names that have no bearing on anything actually came from the countless rules that govern these things.  It might be fun if someone with free time could research them."

Also, although I was very well acquainted with certain characters through my assignments as a designer, I had to immerse myself in the rest of the Evangelion universe, in whose creation I hadn't been so closely involved.'
>
> For this reason, the first few issues of the manga kept extremely close to the TV storyline. But Sadamoto was already using the manga to play up his own interests, accentuating elements that might have passed the viewing audience by.
>
> In the manga version, the first shot of the underwater angel attack shows  it drifting past the submerged hulk of the Gainax building. The character of Doctor Ikari is slightly more sympathetic: the Sadamoto version permits him a relieved smile when Shinji agrees to pilot the Evangelion. It also puts the early episodes back into chronological order, ditching the anime's flashback approach which saves Shinji's first battle until the end of episode two.
>
>> 'Of course I wanted to add as much to it as I could,' says Sadamoto, 'and to try and make the manga version slightly different. The TV series is very much dominated by Hideaki Anno and the staff, but the manga is a "Sadamoto Brand" product, because I've been able to devote myself to it.'
>
> Sadamoto recognised early that the anime team would always have more success with the moving, full-colour battle scenes, and so concentrates more on the characters' thoughts and feelings. Consequently, there is more in the manga on the psychological damage suffered by the pilots, and extra scenes of Shinji recuperating in the hospital. Most notably, there is a cycle of dream sequences in which Shinji encounters his mother, only to see her transform into a fearsome Evangelion machine."

Hayo Miyazaki, from January 1995 _Comic Box_, ["I Understand NAUSICAA a Bit More than I Did a Little While Ago"](http://www.comicbox.co.jp/e-nau/e-nau.html#7) (compare [Anno's 2010](#p-18) memories about making new _Nausicaa_):

> "MIYAZAKI; Nausicaa and Kushana are very similar-they are two sides of the same coin. But Kushana, whose background I showed a little of, has some deep, physical wounds. I think that she had the capacity to become an extremely fair ruler. But I didn't know if a competent front line commander was capable of being a competent ruler, so I didn't make her one. I made her a surrogate ruler, someone who could take the place of the king. I thought that she could be limited to that role. But as I wrote about her, I kept feeling sorry for her. Her character wasn't being communicated through the writing. I was perplexed. I thought that I had to touch on her relationship with her mother and that I had to depict her more clearly, but I had only one page in which to do all that. In the end, though, I had no choice but to get to it.
>
> - I hadn't thought about it that deeply. Mr. Anno (director of 'Fushigi no Umi no Nadia') previously sent a note saying that he would like to write a story with Kushana as the heroine. I feel that it would be a rather interesting story.
>
> MIYAZAKI: No, I don't think so. It would be boring. He just wants to play war games. I don't dislike playing war-I think that the battle scene I did in volume 3 was done perfectly. It was done well enough that I could say "See! Told you so!!"-but that's just overweening pride. When it comes to depicting war, I think that I can do it just as well as anyone else. But Nausicaa is not a manga about war.
>
> - But [obstinately] what's wrong with having an hour and a half long fighting scene with Kushana as a peerless front line commander?
>
> MIYAZAKI: It's useless. Terrible. Well, that goes without saying, doesn't it? If that's the only plan that's been made then it would be much better to just give up the movie entirely. [laughs] Lots of movies about peerless front line commanders have already been done in America. 'Combat' for example."

> "This was a one-page transcript of Anno's remarks at Anime Expo '96. This is hard to imagine today, but at that point (July 1996)  the series had been over for two months, yet many American fans still hadn't seen it--not because they didn't want to, but because there was as yet no digital distribution of anime, fan or licensed--only by getting a physical copy of the tape could you watch it. This limited the speed at which an audience could grow, of course, and ADV's version was not yet on the market. Anno said a few things at the AX'96 panel that have been remembered, but what I find most interesting is "when asked about Evangelion's last two episodes, which upset many fans, Anno cooly replied, 'I have no problem with them. If there's a problem, it's all with you guys. Too bad.'" I'm not absolutely sure (it may be in my transcription notes) but I think Anno might have said "too bad" in English, presumably for emphasis."

> "Evangelion is like a puzzle, you know. Any person can see it and give his/her own answer. In other words, we're offering viewers to think by themselves, so that each person can imagine his/her own world. We will never offer the answers, even in the theatrical version. As for many Evangelion viewers, they may expect us to provide the 'all-about Eva' manuals, but there is no such thing. Don't expect to get answers by someone. Don't expect to be catered to all the time. We all have to find our own answers."

> "The sudden abandonment of the narrative conclusion and puzzles of the fictional world that had been constructed up until the 24th episode, brought about an intense shock in animation fans....
>
> It's fair to say that Evangelion is a story which depicts "anxiety without a cause" which exhaustively ends with a convincing feeling of tension. It's clear that this kind of feeling is widespread when we look at the AUM incident and its repercussions. On this point, the work has a striking feeling of the present. However, the thing that we should pay closer attention to is the paradoxical whereby feelings of anxiety are always determined materialistically, but for the people who are caught in the center of this kind of anxiety, they can only experience it abstractly....
>
> One of my friends who is from Poland described his completely accurate impression of Rei as being related to the problems of post-war, in other words Rei is linked to the problems of Bosnia,etc. At the same time I thought that the room overlaps with a science laboratory, particularly a medical laboratory. Therefore, ANNO intersected images of refugees/ trauma with the "scientific" -- this is the only word that can accurately express the situation -- motif of stark anti-decorativeness. (After all, this would be linked to questions about AUM, more specifically to the problem of "Satyan," AUM's scientific laboratories) Rei's solitude is grounded in a completely tactile substantiality which gives us extremely realistic images of the discommunication that children of the present face. And these images of discommunication belong neither to Kogyal("child girl")-like autism nor to otaku-like autism which has been defined in opposition to Kogyal-like autism. (And these two types of autism are nothing more than the opposing gender extremities of post-modern decorativeness)
>
> Motifs such as charming beautiful girls and hi-tech machines which has strengthened the barrenness of anime, and in the end became important elements in his [Hideaki Anno's] work. It became crucial to articulate 90's-like problems through stereotypes and abstract motifs. To begin with "Evangelion" is an extremely otaku-like work which was by lots of details referenced from former anime and science fiction films, from the design concept of cockpit to the brand of beer (Here in this aspect I don't have time to treat it, although it's important) In other words, it can be said that ANNO broke through the literary imagination of the 1980's by strongly mixing and re-editting the motifs of the anime-like imagination, which had been completely barren for some ten years....
>
> In the opening scene of "Evangelion" he already inserts a cut of a character which had initially been introduced in the 24th episode. The countless devices of this type means that Anno started the broadcast after conceiving the total structure pretty clearly [indeed?]. Actually, the speed of the narrative development of numerous foreshadowing in the first few episodes indicates that his work was made by reverse calculation of a precise, total construction. The flavor of the episodes of the first half is consistently the same. (Some comical episodes after the 8th episode are considered within this consistency). This story revived the genre of animation and at the same time, clarified the limits of the literary imagination...

>
> According to Anno himself, this change of attitude came about while creating and producing the work. "Evangelion" was received enthusiastically among anime fans. He said that in noticing that autistic, enthusiast reception, he thought he should changed the entire conceptual structure of the work, and in the end that's what he did. After all of the episodes were broadcast, in what looks like a self-tormenting, auto-destructive critique of anime fans that ANNO would repeat many times in radio interviews, specialty anime magazines, etc., he would clearly reiterate the personal intellectual history of MIYAZAKI and OSHII. All three of them isolated themselves from "anime-like things" owing to their hate of the autism after they achieved overwhelming success among anime fans. But ANNO is completely different from them on two critical points. The first difference occurs in "Evangelion" with its simultaneous deep absorption in the anime-like and it's distance from it. In Anno's case the change was terribly compressed. In MIYAZAKI's case, the change occurred between the time of the success of "Lupin the Third, The Castle of Cagliostro" (1979) and "Totoro," and in OSHII's case he took about ten years between the time of the television version of "Urusei Yatsura" and "Mobile Police, Patlabor 2."
>
> In the second difference, as perhaps an inevitable result of that temporal compression, in ANNO the successful critique of anime was brought about by the logic of acceleration and multiplication, while in the case of MIYAZAKI and OSHII the critique of anime succeeded because of the logic of removal. The last half of "Evangelion" takes the form of a critique of previous anime works through developing all the narrative possibilities and anime-like expressions and pushing them to their limits; in other words producing a totality of the anime-like. Simply put, in the second half of "Evangelion" ANNO produces a super-complicated and super-high speed anime and thereby achieved a qualitative change. Several compositions were made for the purposes of constructing a 90's savior narrative were rapidly inverted and were instead employed to tear to shreds the interactive communication among the characters. This means that for ANNO, he deliberately cut off communication with anime fans who supposedly can only appreciate works by identifying themselves with and investing their emotions into the characters....
>
> There are no compromises in ANNO's second half. By employing difficult lines and the omission of mise-en-scene , quick scene shifts, and busy cuts with few frames (in animation this is extremely luxurious because it requires a new illustration for speeds less than one frame-per-second) he manages to condense the narrative which would usually have required several episodes into one. For example, Rei dies in the time of just two minutes. We are overwhelmed by its speed. On the other hand simultaneously Anno will one after another invert riddles in the second part of the story that had been solved in the first half. Therefore, if we only watch an episode only one time, the plot will be almost impossible to follow. (In other words this means that ANNO completely disregarded the age of the viewers who would have been expected to be watching at that broadcast time following the rules of the televisual medium. ) Nevertheless, in the last half of "Evangelion" in a dimension completely separate from that of the narrative logic, he was fairly successful at communicating the feeling of anxiety and the misery of the characters who are one after another wounded to the point of death. How did he accomplish that?
>
> The last half of "Evangelion" gradually loses the co-ordination with the complicated foreshadowing that was installed in the first half and loses the science-fictional, simulational reasonableness of the composition of the fictional world. (Which is natural given by the change of direction) However, it doesn't mean that the structure became careless. Instead a density and strange necessity arises. For example in episode #22 there is the unfolding of an incomprehensible story as Eva brings down the angel on a satellite orbit only by the throw of a special spear. A rational explanation is not even provided inside the story. But certainly the unfolding of the story possesses a certain inevitability with the flow of the scenes. That "inevitability" which exists especially independent from the narrative strategy is the true worth of the last half of "Evangelion." That inevitability allows for the dissemination of despair and tension....
>
> To put it boldly, from episode 17 until episode 24 (but especially in episode 18, 19, 22, and 23) at the moment when that condensed unfolding reaches its highest point, he several times makes me thing of GODARD. That is not an explanation related to the quality of cinema itself. That doesn't mean that ANNO tried to cite or parody GODARD. Anybody can borrow stereotypical "Godard-like" images. (Of course ANNO himself does it. For instance using lots of subtitles)"

> Azuma: Finally, only one question about the "set up" of the work. The enemy called "Angel" has no conrete image. It might be a pyramid, a ring of light, a virus.... in what way did you intend that?
>
> Anno: They were paradoxically presented as things without form. For me the idea of an "enemy" is ambiguous, because my relationship to "society" is ambiguous..... The adults of the previous generation taught us that, despite fighting against the system, they were not able to accomplish anything.
>
> Azuma: I felt it was awfully close to the image of the enemy [presented] by Aum Shinrikyou.
>
> Anno: Aum is part of my generation. I understand them well.
>
> Azuma: Although I'm roughly ten years your junior, from my perspective there seems to be a strong sympathy with Aum from people of your generation. But if you say "an Aum-like thing," you have to distinguish it from the reality of Aum, right?
>
> Anno: We create works that "rationalize" or "sublimate" our "Aum-like" parts. The people who joined Aum did not do this. Hating society, they cut themselves off by their own volition. I wish Aum itself had "sublimated," but I think instead it steadily came apart and finally collapsed, ending with this act of self-destruction. Even though there was, to a certain extent, some talent there, overall I had no sympathy for the organization.

Public outrage over the ambiguous, mocking conclusion of the series - combined with the factor of EVANGELION's vast popularity - led to the announcement from Gainax that a double-feature EVA "movie" would be released in the spring of 1997.

> Then Okamoto talked about his filming _Okinawa Battle_ in Okinawa and the problem with lack of manpower and resource, ended up doing one of the characters.
>
> Then Anno said it's easier in anime -- if one more character is needed just draw him. But Anno said anime and real life both have aspects that the other side may envy. For example in anime, the camera does not move, and the shadow and body motion needs to be made realistic. Even with CG it has become easier, it still has that CG feel. Anno then said for anime the main work is still about fixing the motion. Scrolling and wrapping the background is particularly inefficient.
>
> Then more flattery from Anno about how Okamoto's tempo and scene cutting is suitable for anime. And then Anno talked about frame aspect ratio -- love Cinescope and miss its disappearance. Hate standard ratio and also not like Vista. He loves the way when Cinescope aspect is used audience have to follow the scene by moving their heads which is something not possible with TV watching.

> Skipped the part that talks about _Blood and Sand_ [血と砂 (No English release - reads "Chi to suna"), 1965] and _Sengoku yarou_ [1963], and use of long shots. Except that Anno mentioned the fun thing with anime is that the photographer doubles as the actor in anime and in real-life you never see cameraman doubles as actor.
>
> Very technical talk about how many frames of films to use for one blink. Anno said 6-7 frames, if he does not want the scene to get noticed, he put 6, if he wants to make sure it gets noticed he put at least 9 frames. And he said that if it is familiar and static scene, even 2 frames can leave an impression. 3 frames may already make it too slow. But if it is fighting it needs 7-8 frames. Took 12 frames in film, cut may be 5-6, depending on how the pictures look. And of course in dialogue how to cut is already predetermined. He said he spent 12 hours to cut 20 min of animation. The longest time took him 24 hours.
>
> Skipped the part about talking with the audience.
>
>
> About line of eye sight:
>
> A - In the case of anime, the acting and performance usually does not take that much into account. One reason could be the character design. The eyes of the characters usually stress on the details of the eyes and this make it difficult to put acting by using line of sight. However, in Eva the character design is comparatively easier to do such acting, so I put some effort into that. Like where the character is looking at in that scene, or whether the audience are going to see the eyes or not...
>
> Because it is so fundamental I took great care about it. So unusually I put instructions in the storyboard like "Eyes are looking here". As I am influenced by director Okamoto, I used camera line of sight more than usual
>
> O - if possible, line of sight should be on somewhere close. And on direction, A would look at B and then speak, and B would look back at A in reaction. It has to be like that...
>
> A - for me, camera line of sight is often on the front. The drawing staff usually hates it. Drawing frontal face is more difficult and often it could not be done well. But if the line of sight goes the other way, it becomes hard to use it to act.
>
> O - There is power if the guy's sight is close to you
>
> A - yes, that's it. That has energy in it.
>
> A - I don't like switching between front and side. It is easier to frame the position of eyes of the characters if it is a front to front exchanges between the lines of sights of two persons. Anime is at the end a 2D thing so the amount of information is limited.
>
> When it is cut to a new scene, the audience will try to search for something to focus, and if it is a face, it will be the eyes they look first. So when the eyes have expressed the information, you can cut to another scene already. In TV anime, static scenes are many.
>
> I think this is the proper way to go. Although I think acting by eyes is very important it is also very tedious. I don't mind putting effort into doing it but somehow when I look at it later I have a feeling that it won't get noticed, or nobody cares. And then I get a bit irritated.
>
> O - Perhaps because eyes in anime characters are so big...
>
> A - That has many physical reasons. If we do not make the eyes big and treat it as a symbol for the characters, it will become difficult for many to draw.
>
> O - but one can act just by eyes. Like the position of the iris...
>
> A - true, but as the end we only have the drawings to fall back on. If we overdo that kind of serious acting, it carries a risk of looking ridiculous. Character Design is a difficult thing.
>
>
> About Director: Skipped the part about old time directors and struggles with studio about rights to edit. Except Anno said that for anime sometimes it needs to do editing without having all drawings. But he thinks editing is fun. Gather extra cuts and then try to experiment by switching the cuts or rearranging order and that is interesting. And even the question of whether to cut 2 frames or not can make a difference.
>
> About Storyboarding: More flattery from Anno about watching _Ghost Train_ and Okamoto said because of AD's mistake he once needed to take 140-150 cuts in one day.
>
>
> A - for movies, consensus is impossible
>
> O - Director must be a dictator
>
> A - He is a despot. Nothing can move forward if we have to wait until someone else makes a decision and approves. Also the personal character would not come out. In anime, a overall design called storyboard is made from the very beginning. And the production system is based on that design, so it is easier to unify opinions. On the other hand, there is an image that the director's job is over once the storyboard is decided.
>
> O - since we are on it, in _Gunbuster_ and _Eva_ last episode, there are parts in black and white, that flashback, that kind of stood out. It used quite a bit of sketch like drawings. Did the storyboard also cover that?
>
> A - It was put in there.
>
> O - Oh, those sketches were interesting. It somehow feels it's moving.
>
>
> Anime vs real-life film: Okamoto said real-life is not necessarily better. Anno said many anime directors want to do real-life. Many simply put drawings in place of real-life images and they seem to want to push anime to look closer to real life film. And both think it is not a good idea.
>
> Final comment by Anno - Animation is a kind of static world, but there is a yearn for thrill when it switches from one static world to another static world and that cut to new scene is a most efficient way to get such thrill. And he thinks Okamoto's style of film cutting has similar effect
>
> A - in a TV anime, 30 min of video has a limit of 3500 pictures. So the images cannot move as much as I want. And how to squeeze out the best from the image in such lack of motion, it is all in the cutting.
>

   --January 1997 _Animage_ interview/discussion between Anno and film-maker [Kihachi Okamoto](!Wikipedia); [Japanese source](http://johakyu.net/lib/2008/05/2008-05-18-000850.php); [translated](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=434860#434860) by [symbv](http://forum.evageeks.org/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5214)

> --- Nobi-san was reduced to tears by Episode 14. How [did you compose] Rei's monologue?
>
> Anno: I had intended to recap the series in the first half of the episode. When I did the second half, I had long forgotten to explore what sort of person Rei was, so [I believed] it was necessary to develop her.
>
> The script for episode 16 had been written before that. At first I had planned [a scenario where] Shinji and the angel would make "first contact," but I wasn't able to pull it off.
>
> In the original conception, the languages of various countries and the cries of various animals and miscellaneous noises would appear on the screen; [selecting from] among these, the angel would finally hit upon Japanese. When this happens, there is a sharp noise, an image [suddenly] fills [the screen], and [the angel] asks if this is right for [Shinji's] thought-language or thought-patterns; it would have started from there.
>
> --- That's really cool.
>
> Anno: As far as that goes, I thought it was fine, but then when [the angel] speaks Japanese that was the end [of my conception]. Kaworu-kun had been prepared as a "human type" [angel] from the start, and I wanted to hold on to the idea of [an angel] conversing in human language until then. When I wondered, well, what will [Shinji] do after he gets taken into the angel, I wondered if this might be [his] chance for self-reflection. Episode 16's "inner space"-like environment was the first [of that sort]. That went relatively smoothly.
>
> When it came to Rei, I was completely blocked. I couldn't write anything at all. I had intended to make Rei a schizophrenic (分裂症的) character, but when I tried to write, I couldn't think of anything - nothing at all. Finally, I thought, when writing madness, one has no choice but to become mad. At that time I consulted a bit with my friends. When I asked if there was something composed by a madman, I was loaned a "Bessatsu Takarajima"^["<http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%A5%E5%86%8A%E5%AE%9D%E5%B3%B6> A collection of half-book/half-magazines on a variety of subjects published by Takarajima-sha."] volume on mental illness. It was an "easy and reasonable" book [イージーでリーズナブルな本] (laughs), but inside it there was a poem written by a madman. That was extremely good. When I read the poem I had a strong impression, as though this was the first time that I had come close. I had a feeling like a light glinting upon the tip of a sharp knife. It was certainly not the feeling of an ordinary man. That was good. If I think about it now, this sort of 'capacity' was [already] within me (laughs). ^["?? '今考えればそういう素養が自分にあったというだけの話なんですけど(笑)。'"] It's mad to believe that the writings of a madman are of the highest quality. I read that [poem] and was filled with images; I was able to write [Rei's monologue] in one sitting.
>
> It's alleged that [the monologue] was based upon another text, but in all honesty, that's not so. There was something that inspired it, but it was completely different. It's alleged that it strongly resembles someone's poem, and it that it was probably copied from it, but, "Ah, well, that man is probably crazy too" (laughs). It seems to be a famous poem. Being able to write something to the extent that it's said to be the same, I can't help thinking, "Don't I have talent, too?" (laughs)^["I haven't been able to find out much about this poem."]
>
> After the television broadcast finished, I became worse and worse, and went to see a doctor. I even seriously contemplated death. It's like [I] was empty, with no meaning to [my] existence. Without the slightest exaggeration, I had put everything I had [into Evangelion]. Really. After that finished I realized that there was nothing [left] inside of me. When I asked [the doctor?] about it afterwards, [he said?] "Ah, that is an 'identity crisis' (self-collapse) [自我崩壊]."^["I can't tell if this is the doctor speaking about Anno's crisis, or something else (something Anno heard people say about himself or about Evangelion?)."] It was a sensation as though I had taken something like extremely bad LSD. I was told, "It's amazing that you were able to do that without medication." Yeah, now, I feel very fortunate (laughs).^["I'm somewhat unclear as to who is speaking, and what refers to what, here. ^__^; Sorry! I hope it's not completely wrong, but... 'Medication' here is 'kusuri.'"] In order to determine whether or not I really wanted to die, I went up to the rooftop of this building (the GAINAX building) and stuck my foot out, waiting to lose my balance and fall forward. I did it to personally determine [whether I wanted to live or die], [thinking,] if I really want to die, I should die here, and if I don't want to die, I'll step back. Well, it didn't lead to my death, and so I'm here.
>
> At first I was manic, but I rapidly developed a severe depression. I wouldn't leave my office at work; I would leave only to use the bathroom, and I would almost never eat meals. A dilemma suddenly arose: I didn't want to encounter other people, and yet I did want to encounter other people.
>
> I don't return home [at the end of the day], because the time and effort spent returning is bothersome. I just stay overnight here all the time; I don't return home more than a few times in a year. At work, when I go to the bathroom, I go across the studio, I have to encounter people. I just wanted to think by myself, so I returned home for the first time in many months. My bed is never made, so there's nothing to do but crawl into it. When I took my clothes off and lay down - I can't put it any other way than extraordinarily terrifying, terrifying thoughts [怖い考え] - I had a sensation like my whole body was enveloped in such [thoughts]. When I was enveloped by this, I suddenly leapt to my feet and, in a panicked state, threw on my clothes, grabbed my bag, and went out onto the street, [crying,] "Taxi!" I went back to my workplace, I went back to my office at my workplace and slept. This is the "identity crisis." I don't have the feeling that I want to die, or anything like that. There's nothing I can say [that can explain things]. On the other hand, that was how seriously I took "Evangelion."
>
> --- I wonder why human beings require a meaning to their existence. [The lack of such] produces anxiety.
>
> Anno: I think it's more natural for human beings to be anxious. I think happiness is nothing but an illusion [錯覚].

### ORIGINAL

1. _Evangelion Original_ I ISBN 4-8291-7321-1 C0076 P980E (episodes #1 - #9)
2. _Evangelion Original_ II ISBN 4-8291-7322-x C0076 P980E (#10- #18)
3. _Evangelion Original_ III ISBN 4-8291-7323-8 C0076 P980E (#19- #26)

These 3 books were published 1996-1997; they seem to be nearly-final drafts - they include a number of dialogue changes and occasional deleted scenes. They were used by the [Literal Translation Project](http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~onizuka/literal/evangelion.html), but unfortunately LTP seems to have edited their transcription to conform to the final aired anime episodes & omitted all the interesting differences such as the deleted scenes. (This is a pity because some changes are quite interesting, like Rei I surviving.) Parts of ORIGINAL have been translated:

- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-April/027465.html), episode 1 (? guess from first mention of N^2 being first episode), "In EVANGELION ORIGINAL, the N^2 mine was originally called P-type mine. I wonder why."
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/028939.html), episode 1, Misato's line: "Didn't even Rei take seven months to sync with the EVA? He's just arrived. He can't possibly control it!"
- [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-March/026489.html), episode 2, scene variant: SEELE scene discussing the first Angel attack; different from ADV or LTP translation (ORIGINAL version discusses how it was expected and SEELE's contempt for the rest of humanity; aired version discusses how their preparations may not pay off and the need for NERV to be very careful)
- [Shin-seiki](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=116702#116702) says episode 03, "Hedgehog's Dilemma: Rain, after running away", was originally titled "Hedgehog's Dilemma: The Wandering Third Children" (TODO: was this confirmed in the Platinum commentary?)
- [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/029204.html), episode 3 & episode 7, changed lines:

    > In EVANGELION ORIGINAL I, p. 3-11, Touji said his father and mother worked at the research institute (NERV?), but this was changed in the actual series to his father and uncle [Bochan seems mistaken here - Literal & ADV both say father and *grandfather*; Proposal only mentions father], thus eliminating his mother. The girl's line about her mother [episode 7, "My mother is decorating a lot for the discussion of post-graduate life. She's so silly!"] does not appear in EVANGELION ORIGINAL, so it was added at a later date (during the recording?) and may have slipped through the editing process.

    [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/029298.html) notes this latter line is not mentioned in any footnote either, indicating it was added very late in production.
- [Savant](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-June/015718.html) discusses the Chinese version of ORIGINAL I, confirming Reichu's description of the marginalia and quotes one such comment: "This script portrays Shinji as being more 'soft' than in the finished series."
- [Seven Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-February/025759.html), episode 12, Misato-Shinji discussion of her father (seems same as TV)
- [CuSO4](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-May/014267.html) confirms that episodes 13 and 14 were mistakenly swapped
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/029298.html), episode 14, variant synch-ratio line by Ritsuko Akagi. (Seventh Messenger transcribes this as episode *13* with episode 14's titles but as noted above by CuSO4, ORIGINAL swaps them)
- [Reichu](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=196289#196289) mentions that episode 17 originally mentions an 'Essene' organization rather than 'Seele', fitting in with [the storyboard](http://www.evacommentary.org/op/op_2.html#cut044); [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-May/028353.html) says "...SEELE is the remnant of the Essenic branch that wrote the DSS (based on information in EVANGELION ORIGINAL)..." and [NAveryW](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=196222#196222) spots of the word [Essene](!Wikipedia) in a ['Project Meeting'](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=196081#196081) document (a brainstorming session apparently predating the Evangelion Proposal; see [Project Meeting](#project-meeting).)
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-September/020217.html) translates a deleted scene in episode 18 where Touji visits his sister in the hospital, a modified scene between Ritsuko & Misato, and a modified scene in episode 3.
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-February/025983.html), episode 19, some tech jargon
- [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-August/030966.html) paraphrases a section in episode 19 where Eva-01 eats the S2 Engine of an angel
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-February/025401.html) provides the Touji-Hikari hospital scene in episode 19, and Yui's flashback plugtest scene in episode 21
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/029072.html), episode 21, variant techno-babble line by Naoko Akagi
- [NAveryW](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=368599#368599) (translation by Eric Blair in #evageeks), episode 21, deleted Misato line: "I know the Angels aren't just battle weapons left by the First Root Race." [Reichu](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=410193#410193) transcribes the kanji and translates them as "I know the Angels aren't just weapons left behind by the First Indigenous Race." This is important - it is one of the few solid leads (aside from the Project Meeting and the Proposal) that the First Ancestral Race was not invented for the video games but were part of the backstory early on.
- [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/028905.html), episode 21, changed scene description; Rei I survives! This is worth quoting in full:

    > "Dr. Akagi glimpses Yui in Rei's leering face. She impulsively clutches at Rei's throat and begins to strangle her. Muffled cries escape from Rei's throat and Dr. Akagi regains her  senses. Rei's arms dangle limply...The loud 'thud' of a falling object is heard. Rei's breath rasps in her throat as she tries to breathe again. She looks around but Dr. Akagi is nowhere to be seen. Expressionless, she gets up and staggers out of the control center...Exterior view of completed NERV Headquarters (pyramid) with the  blood-red NERV logo on its front."
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/028887.html), episode 21, scene description: "Analysis platform. Nothing remained where the corpse of Dr. [Naoko] Akagi had fallen except a white outline. There was blood on the cover of Gaspar."
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/028964.html), episode 21, cut scene: "At the bottom of the page that Bochan quoted, there's a little footnote that says GAINAX excluded the scene of Rei waking up."
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-February/025514.html) excerpts 3 Ritsuko scenes from episode 23: the disposal of Rei's remains, Ritsuko before the SEELE monoliths, and Ritsuko entering Central Dogma with Misato & Shinji
- [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/029653.html), episode 24, translation discussion - did Kaworu say "It means I *like* you" or "It means I *love* you"?

    > The ambiguous word is "suki" which can be interpreted as 'like' or 'love'. I interpret it here is 'like' because of the preceeding word "koui", which has probably been mistranslated, thus deepening the misunderstanding. "Koi" (short 'o') means 'love'. "Koui" (long 'o') means 'friendship/affinity/goodwill'. While the long and short 'o' are difficult to hear, the kanji in the written script are those for "koui".
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/028928.html), episode 24, Kaworu's order to Unit-02
- [Bochan_bird](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-March/026419.html) translates a cut episode 24 scene fits perfectly in EoE but not EoTV, in which SEELE discusses Kaworu's death; [Reichu](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=472732#472732) translates her copy, Keele's line in this one runs

    > Keel: The Angels who were the Children of Adam have all perished. Only the final Angel — humanity, us — remains. The promised day has come. When Lilith is enwombed with a soul*, this impure world shall be cleansed.
- [Seventh Messenger](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-October/021550.html) translates the opening from episode 26; primary difference is "Everyone has lost something. Because of this, the complementation of the heart and soul continues.", as opposed to "The thing that people lost, in other words, the complementation of the mind has begun." or "The thing that people had lost / In other words, the instrumentality of souls was still ongoing".

> Anno commented in various interviews after the conclusion of the series that "anime fans need to have more self-respect" and to "come back to reality"; in a Newtype interview on 10 May, after the announcement on 26 April of a new movie and re-edited versions of the TV series, he also stated that "computer networking is graffiti on toilet walls."

> When I heard that EVANGELION was censored (see our article "Evangelion Controversy" on page 45), I was totally outraged. How this could be possible in our modern world? And all this (we speculated) in the name of religious belief? What about free speech? How could a legal system go along with this? Well, maybe it did not and the TV station censored the show itself to avoid offending certain sensibilities. We cannot really know where the truth lies. I was particularly confused when my friend Miyako read me Hideaki Anno's interview in NEWTYPE of June. He avoided the subject of censorship and skillfully defended his work. His point of view made sense and he made some interesting comments about the Internet fans who excessively criticized the show.
>
> "I think the people who are very much involved with the Net," Mr. Anno said, "have very narrow views toward life and the world. They're always in their rooms and don't go out very often to communicate in person. Because of their information on the Net, they feel they know everything without searching the real truths." They easily and anonymously say things that they would never say in person. "Their messages are like graffiti in a public toilet." They attack other while they are staying in a safe place. "They don't have anything certain to hold on... that's probably why they watch anime shows. (...) I would like to add and say to those fans, hey, go out and visit towns. I am 35 now and I am realizing the importance of human contact little by little..."

> "To update on the EVANGELION controversy, nothing really came out from Anno-san at Anime Expo. He seemed embittered, and quickly lost patience with the fans. "If you don't understand, it is your problem", he said! He made many comments in such terms that our reporter on location couldn't put them on paper. For more details, check our report on Anime Expo in the next issue. Anyway, someone who worked on EVANGELION did confirm that the last episodes (from 19 and on, but mainly 25-26) were censored following pressure from the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association; but no mention of any legal action) and that they had been botched.

## 1996 S

> The television broadcasts were finished two months ago. But "Eva fever" has not yet cooled down. As a matter of course, there was also a big reaction to the interview with Anno Hideaki in the June issue of NT (Newtype). It seems like bunches of letters are delivered to the editorial office daily for Director Anno, which he is reading little by little as his busy schedule permits
['From Newtype, July 7, 1996 issue'](http://web.archive.org/web/20001212215800/www.acsys.com/~tallman/ecom_e.html) ("Note: this is still a rough translation.")

> However, despite being made as a group operation, there are TV series that are colored almost entirely by the personality of one individual. Hayao Miyazaki's "Conan, Boy of the Future" is that way, and many of the series where Yoshiyuki Tomino served as chief director are also the same.
>
> "Neon Genesis Evangelion" is also a series that was shaped by the personality of its one creator, Hideaki Anno. The worldview, character creation, creation of Mecha, the gadgets, the division of cuts, and even to the point of each line of dialogue, everything is inscribed with the name of "Hideaki Anno." For example, the mental landscape of Anno.is, of course, reflected in the story, behavior patterns of the characters and the like. Anno's mood is reflected and his intent is clear even in trivial places like the name of a department store or the brand of can coffee that appears.

> Those "thoughts" about a piece of work are, for the viewer, a bit of a sophisticated way of enjoying it. After viewing a piece of work, that work is assimilated in the viewer's head through thinking, "Did that mean this?" and "Is that right?" and will go on to become the building block of thought. Being able to come across works that can be contemplated is an irreplaceable encounter.
>
> However, recently I feel that these encounters are scarce. I wonder if I'm just imagining this?
>
> ... Thinking requires effort. When anime is thought of as "entertainment", I'm not denying that there is also a policy that the audience not be made to use unnecessary effort. Works that are just to been seen and enjoyed. Those are also probably necessary. However, weren't there too many of those types of works? Among those, "Neon Genesis Evangelion" was clearly a work that could be thought about. While keeping its entertainment value as a piece of work, it also offers enjoyment that the audience thinks about. The Eva Boom that you all know about proves that. Everyone is starving for thinking.
>
> And the story pregnant with riddles concluded, for many of the audience members, still pregnant with those riddles. There were also fans who screamed, "I was betrayed" by that ending. However, this is also certain proof that Eva draws people in.

Aren't I really talking about the limitations inside myself ?    It is the creators who have to change their frame of mind .'Most people who make anime ,Anno said,have the kind of 'autism' he himself has suffered from .'They have to try and reach out with their work,and communicate to others .What's the greatest thing anime has ever achieved ?The fact that we're holding a dialogue right now .'When a fan of the master asked for advice to those who'd like to break into anime,he shot back,'Be interested in other things *besides* animation .'

> This was part one of a four-part interview with the founding president of Gainax, Toshio Okada, conducted at Otakon '95, and should certainly be read as an alternate viewpoint to many of the events described in ["The Notenki Memoirs"](docs/2002-notenki-memoirs). It ran in Animerica 4:2 through 4:5, although Okada only touches on Eva in 4:2. At the time the interview was conducted, Evangelion was in production but had not yet aired, and Okada mentions episode 5 in the context of how Gainax (since he left) has gained more control over its scheduling. He also makes the interesting assertion that he was talking about "the base story of Neon Genesis Evangelion" with Anno back when he was still at the company (he dates his departure to 1992). Hiroyuki Yamaga would later respond to some of Okada's remarks in Animerica 6:5, but not those related to Eva (I don't believe Yamaga's 1997 and 1998 Fanime remarks on Eva ever appeared in Animerica, although I think Miyako Matsuda-Graham may have covered it for Protoculture Addicts).

> OKADA: I had a lot of fun making GUNBUSTER, but I didn't have that burning sensation when I made OTAKU NO VIDEO. It was something that I lightly made. I made it that way because I thought the people who watched it were like the people in the live-action portion--not the people who made it. 1983 was the turning point for myself and my friends. Basically what I wanted to do was set the stage for 1983 because that was when everything was changing; I wanted to show people what it was like during that period back in 1983, how we lived, basically, what our life was as otaku.
>
> PANEL: I'd like one more question, and then I'm going to open it up to everybody: There are many themes...I go back to OTAKU NO VIDEO--you talk a lot about, and it seems like you predicted in that film, a lot of the commercialization and product management that is now very, very common in the animation industry. Do you feel more strongly now about the way things have to be processed, and managed, and shoved out the door--you see all around you the selling of creativity?
>
> OKADA: That world we made in OTAKU NO VIDEO, it was not a prediction: it was an otaku's dream. Maybe we can be more major, or a bigger group, or maybe we can make our own theme parks! But in these days, I can't believe all of the things that are happening--our otaku's dreams are beginning to become a reality in the United States. I am very surprised, and very glad.

> [OKADA:] Mr. Miyazaki's new movie, MONONOKE-HIME, is going to be using 80 cuts of computer graphics in it. If there were more opportunity, time, or availability, he would have wanted to use 120 cuts in it. So Mr. Miyazaki is also one of the people starting to use computer graphics, too. And, also, Mr. Miyazaki says, "If we'd had a computer system when we made LAPUTA, there's half of it I'd like to remake." So there's great possibilities with computer graphics. And Mr. Anno has said, in remaking the last two episodes of EVANGELION, he's going to Studio Ghibli to study Mr. Miyazaki's system. And that studio has a big system for computer-graphics images. I've heard they've got five, or seven, Silicon Graphics workstations. What Anno wants to make is a "snow world"-- the Eva units fighting the enemy amidst a world of snow, on a snow- covered mountain. But it's very difficult to portray snow falling and piling, and the robots walking through the snow--it's very difficult to draw by the human hand. Mr. Anno wants to make a masterful scene of a battle amongst the snow.
>
> ...AUDIENCE: Many Americans believe the line Kubo [OTAKU NO VIDEO] has concerning wanting to become the tyrannical king to be a reference to Nostradamus. We were wondering if it really is, and if Gainax was into other forms of Western occultism, like Masonry, or the Knights of Malta.
>
> OKADA: No, no! (waves dismissively at audience).
>
> PANEL: [TO AUDIENCE MEMBER] You're a bad boy!
>
> OKADA: The setting of 1983 is still the primary focus of OTAKU NO VIDEO, and the characters in that video during the time had seen the movie, NOSTRADAMUS: THE MAN WHO SAW THE FUTURE [narrated by Orson Welles-*ed.*]. Anyway, what it was, is that, their idea--that vision was so strong in their minds that they presented that story. And what I wanted to do was for people to see it, and make that, and say, "Oh, there are still people like this!" or, "Yes, that was the way it was back then."

> AUDIENCE: Many Japanese intellectuals are Christians. Similarly, the characters in OTAKU NO VIDEO were clearly outcasts. Do you believe that liminality is necessary for creativity? [SOTTO VOCE] Try and translate that one, pal...O.K....Do you feel it is easier for social outcasts to be creative, to invent original ideas?
>
> OKADA: That's right. Basically, creativity will not come out of happy lives, but from people who become outcasts. There is no reason for you to become *purposely* unhappy. 'Cause everybody who watches anime is happy--the people who watch it who are *not* happy, are the people who make it [LAUGHS]. It's not too good of a thing to make anime. I think a peaceful life is to take anime merchandise cheap from Japan, and then sell it expensively over here and/or work at Viz and make some weird American anime magazine. Very happy! [LAUGHS]

> OKADA: In THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE's story, that planet is six light years from our Earth. So, I told Mr. Yamaga, we should make a continuation story where their spaceship, not interplanetary, but interstellar, arrives here 100 years after the time of HONNEAMISE. So, they come to our Earth, and make contact with Earth. So, it is a continuity of that story. But it is very difficult to make. The plot I want to have, if I am to make a continuation of THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE, is to have the story of them making their own interstellar ship, And that ship will arrive in our solar system right about the time Earth is able to colonize Mars. Not a warp drive, but an acceleration ship.
>
> ...OKADA: Yes. It would take 30 or 40 years. And then I'd try to show the conflict between the two cultures, the two planets. I would be really enthusiastic were I able to make a war between the two planets.

  --["Return of the Otaking"](http://web.archive.org/web/20001217140000/www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking6.html), part 6; this may be connected to the weird cut EoE scenes (see my [argument](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2010-March/005990.html))

> ...[OKADA:] The difference I see is that it's becoming merchandise-based. And if they see something wrong with it, they don't have this burning sensation inside of them to basically say, "Well, if I made it like this--" For example, if you watch RANMA 1/2, and say, "Well, there's something wrong here, but if I made it like *this*, it's going to be like this..." But I don't see that burning sensation as much in the United States or Japan as I did back in 1983 or 1985. What I first started learning in my high school years, when I saw STAR BLAZERS, UCHU SENKAN YAMATO, it was like, "If I had made it like this, it would have been like this." So there's not too much of that anymore, so I guess it's like, "Oh, well, then, I guess everybody's happy--that's fine, then."

>
> OKADA: Right now, he's an executive at Bandai Visual. And he still has a religion: he believes in Mamoru Oshii, just like Jesus Christ [PRAYS TO HEAVEN]. In those days, in 1983 or 1984, he asked of everything to Mr. Oshii: "Is it good, or is it bad?" And if Mr. Oshii said, "Oh, it's good!," so Mr. Watanabe would think, "Oh, it's good, it's good, I must make it, I must make it!" And then I told Mr. Watanabe, "I want to make this film, THE WINGS OF HONNEAMISE," and he thinks, "I think it's a good idea, but I can't decide if it's *really* good. So--just a moment, I must go to Mr. Oshii's house" [RUNS IN PLACE; LAUGHS]. And Mr. Oshii says, "Oh-- it's interesting!" So, he thought, "It's good, it's good, it's good!" [LAUGHS] And it's a very powerful motivation for him, inside. So, he works very hard, and gets a very large budget for our film from the president of Bandai. So Mr. Oshii, he is a very good person for me, or for Studio Gainax, but...but...it is very strange to say, "Maybe it is good, but maybe it is not so good." It was a religion. But just now, Mr. Watanabe, he's come out of his brainwashing. So, he sometimes says: "Maybe...maybe, *maybe*, Mr. Oshii is sometimes wrong." [LAUGHS]

> OKADA: Not so. It's almost the same, from what I said to you at Otakon. You must remember that EVANGELION is produced at Tatsunoko, so the schedule is out of the control of Gainax--it's the responsibility of Tatsunoko. Tatsunoko almost rules, when it comes to control. So, I think, the responsibility was not with Gainax. People say, "It's the responsibility of Mr. Anno," but they're wrong. Control over schedule is the responsibility of the producer. But Tatsunoko and T.V. Tokyo couldn't handle it. It was out of Gainax's control.
>
> AUDIENCE: I talked to a person from Tatsunoko. He said he does not blame Mr. Anno, but he blames other people at Gainax, who might be telling Anno about his schedule, and--
>
> OKADA: Oh! I think producers always say that. But I talked with Mr. Anno about this a month ago, and then he said, "I'm *almost* the producer of EVANGELION, but I must be so, because Tatsunoko did not do anything for EVANGELION." See, he is very disappointed with Tatsunoko, and some rumors have said that Tatsunoko lost the film, or cels before they were shot.
>
> AUDIENCE: Wow!
>
> OKADA: And I asked Mr. Anno, "Is it the truth?" And he says, in a dark voice, "Yes."
>
> AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.
>
> OKADA: But that was in the middle of the episodes. That wasn't the trouble with the last two episodes, the confusion. It was just Mr. Anno's teleplay. He said to me, "I can make a schedule on my own." At that time, I heard from Mr. Anno about his new plans, so maybe you want to--?
>
> AUDIENCE: Of course.
>
> OKADA: After EVANGELION, his next plan is to make a STAR TREK. Not *that* STAR TREK--a sort of anime like STAR TREK, a crew in a spaceship, who go to every planet, and each planet has its own culture. For example, one planet will have a very democratic culture, and everyone will approve, so they'll board, or they say, "no," and they talk with the crew about everything. And the spaceship crew will sometimes fall in love in some way on the planet, or something will happen--*maybe* some robots fight [LAUGHS]. He wants to make that film, because Mr. Anno thinks it will be a very good experience for the Japanese animation world. But the sponsor says, "It's not so good." because, in Japan these days...of course, you know, several years ago, it was the toy makers, like Bandai, who had a very strong control over the production of anime, and what they would want would be something like, "We need three new robots in this film," and so the anime was made with the three new robots. But right now, it's the record companies, like King, Polydor, or Sony Music Entertainment, who have very strong control over the production of anime. And what *they* want, is, "O.K., we've got two new idol singers, and we want to promote them." And so the anime is made with two new characters. [A dig at the _Macross_ franchise?]

  --["Return of the Otaking"](http://web.archive.org/web/20001217163000/www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking8.html); the lost cel anecdote is interesting as cel-collector Mike Toole [claims](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2011-03-13) that "A lot of _Evangelion_ cels were stolen." (although [there were](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-June/029295.html) limited machine- and hand-painted reproductions as well as [one contest](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1 s999-June/029293.html)), The STAR TREK plan is a little odd; may be a version of the scrapped _Olympia_ project (see the "_Olympia_ - the phantom project" chapter in _The Notenki Memoirs_).

> OKADA: Right now, I think there's more than fifty people who work at Gainax. Most of these people work on making computer games, and half of them work on making CD-ROMs, such as the CD-ROM featuring Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's artwork. And there's maybe only two or three people who work on anime. The anime part of Gainax, I think, is Mr. Anno and Mr. Suzuki, and one other person. So, the animation department is very, very small. Most of the people in Gainax just now work on artwork CD-ROMs. When they make anime, they must join forces with another studio. It's a bad case of a company that's grown larger and larger--they have to make a lot of money every year, every month, so they have to make and sell a lot of CD-ROMs, because animation *loses* money. The case of EVANGELION, where they're actually *making* money, is something of a miracle, in the opinion of Gainax executives such as Hiroyuki Yamaga and Mr. Sadamoto, and not something they can expect as normal. They want to keep on making anime, but since it's unprofitable, they must make more CD-ROMs and computer games to balance things out. And so the computer game department gets larger and larger, and the animation department gets smaller and smaller. It's not good.

> OKADA: I think the style, or mood, of EVANGELION, is not so far, not so different, from the serious side of GUNBUSTER or NADIA. The biggest difference would have been in the style of planning the last episode. My style is to always plan the ending *first,* as I did with GUNBUSTER--everything then follows from that. In NADIA, Mr. Anno couldn't decide on the ending--it wasn't fixed until only three months before the final episode was shown. [Compare Okada's comments about Anno & deciding NGE's ending!] So subsequently, I was confused about NADIA, and there was a lack of control over the various episodes. EVANGELION is a very great series--I think it's one of the top anime ever made. But--the last scenes were never fixed. When I talked to Mr. Anno a month ago, he said he couldn't decide the ending until the time came. That's his style. So, if I had made EVANGELION with him, I couldn't do such a thing. I'd think I'd have to fix the ending, what would happen with every character. Then, everything would follow: the first episode, the second episode...If I wanted to show a boy's coming-of-age story, a *bildungsroman,* the last scene would show the grown-up man; the first scene, a boy who hates everything about the adult world. That would be the structure; I'm very careful about a regular construction. But Mr. Anno's style on EVANGELION was not so. He wants to put it together episode-by-episode. It's just like the style of a manga. In your typical manga, the artist doesn't have any picture of the last scene, or the last episode. They just think of building up on past episodes. And finally, the manga artist, and his assistants, and editor...[BURIES HEAD IN HANDS], they work out an idea about the last sequence. If it's a good idea, the whole episode is very good. If they can't make a good idea, the whole episode is not so good. It's an unhappy story. And I think that's what happened with the last two episodes of EVANGELION. Mr. Anno and his staff couldn't make a good idea for it. He told an anime magazine in Japan that he couldn't make what he wanted because of schedule or budget. But that's not correct. I talked with Mr. Yamaga and Mr. Anno. They said, "It's not only a problem of schedule or budget. It's a problem of what the ending is going to be." Mr. Anno couldn't decide. Mr. Anno's and my own style of production are very different.
>
> ... Because many anime and *seiyuu* magazines are asking Mr. Anno that question, and every time his answer changes. It's "confused, confuse-er, confuse-est." He's not happy right now. Maybe you know that back in January, or February, he shaved his head. It's a Japanese gesture of contrition. People said, "Oh, he's feeling a lot of responsibility towards the producer, or T.V. Tokyo, or the sponsor." Not so. He felt a very strong responsibility about *his* stuff. "Sorry, I can't do it!" So he shaved his head. This summer, he hates anime fans. I think he'll feel happier by autumn.

  [Aaron Clark](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=392551#392551) after reading above thread:

> "This reminds me of [Takeshi Honda](!Wikipedia "Takeshi Honda (animator)") at Katsucon many years back. He said that Anno constantly changed things. He changed many of the later episodes at the last minute, and that was so frustrating for him that he did not speak to Anno until after The End of Evangelion was completed."

> OKADA: Yeah, maybe that's right. Right now, many anime fans in Japan are fighting each other over whether that ending was good or bad. Some say, "Anno must feel no obligation towards the fans--he must make something true to himself." Many fans are fighting over this. Your question has come up in these debates. In my personal opinion, if he wanted to make such a statement, to say, "this is just fiction, and you should go back to the real world," he could do it a better way. If that's what he wanted to say, it's not necessary to make an anime to do it. But he's still an animator, and he wants to make another anime series. So his true mind does not say, "it's only animation, and I should go back to the real world." So I think Mr. Anno's confused just now.
>
> ...My style is to look for a good idea, or a good scene, in the midst of a not-so-good manga. If I make it into an anime, maybe it can be better than it was. I heard that Mr. Miyazaki thinks the same way. In FUTURE BOY CONAN, he took the basic novel THE INCREDIBLE TIDE, by Alexander Key--not a very good story, in Mr. Miyazaki's view. But he said, "I can take that story, and make a good anime out of it." He has the power to turn a not-so-good story into a good anime. I think he's a not-so-good person--just like me.

> In 1970, in Japan, the world Expo was held in Osaka. The theme was human progress. I was only an eleven year-old boy back then, and I thought, science can do everything, and make everything better. Man has gone to the Moon, and he'll go to Mars, and Pluto, and to other solar systems. Everything can happen, and everyone will be happy. And I thought the United States could do anything; everyone there is happy. We Japanese will follow them. So we believed then. Of course I can't say that now, in these confused times, but the 1970 Osaka Expo had a tremendous influence on me then, as a young man--that humanity shall progress towards everything, and progress is good. I don't think so, right now...but deep in my mind, there's still a little voice saying, "Human progress is very good! Trust the United States!" [LAUGHS]

> Let us study in detail one by one and try to piece together the personal relationships these frightened adults and children are fated to fence each other into. Let us also study how these small, ordinary relationships grow to be the power that changes the world.
>
> ... It would seem that all is clear between Shinji and Asuka. The situation with them has changed so they can express their feelings and, so to speak, become as close as childhood friends.
>
> Asuka yells "Hot!", splashing the morning bath water, rages over forgetting her lunch box, and openly states her feeling, like an incantation, of being frustrated with wanting Shinji as her partner; from these facts we may infer that her feelings for him as a man are less than they appear to be.
>
> Shinji appears to be henpecked by Asuka. However, since he got very flustered when she slipped into his futon one night, and since he couldn't look straight at her figure in a sexy bathing suit, we may read between the lines that Shinji has feelings for her as a woman. Before the split between Asuka and Shinji, when their friendship was turning into passion, possibilities for Shinji seemed good.

>
> ... However, Touji was selected as the fourth candidate, and when EVA device #1 attacked Touji's EVA device #3, this relationship was broken. Kensuke's dream of being an EVA pilot was also broken, and Hikari's feelings for Touji too...
>
> The 'promise' of a personal relationship was seldom made in "Evangelion" and it made a touching picture that Hikari, an honor student and class president, was charmed by Touji, who had a bit of an image as a delinquent. Hikari was portrayed as a girl who was wishing, "I'm not yet able to confess my feelings, but I want to transmit them somehow," and Touji, either knowing or not knowing about her feelings, promised to eat the leftovers of her box lunch. Touji, Hikari, and Kensuke; from here on we will not be able to take our eyes off of them.

> ... Concerning actual blood relatives introduced in this story, the only pair is the protagonist, Ikari Shinji, who meets with his father, NERV Commander Gendou. However, one very rarely sees "family feelings" between these two. Rather, we can observe more cases where unrelated companions form family-like ties.
>
> ... That Katsuragi Misato lets Shinji live in her apartment is also not merely from sympathy. If Rei and Gendou have exchanged smiles with the same mutual warmth, as peacefully as in a "husband and wife" relationship, Misato and Shinji have something spiritually like an "older sister/younger brother" relationship.
>
> Shinji appears to be afraid of contact with others, and Misato can identify with this, since she continues to be troubled by the loss of her father in the Second Impact. Misato surely has experienced Shinji's feelings of hesitation and pain. Therefore, she blames herself for not giving his feelings enough support at this important stage.
>
> Having just come through such a path herself, Misato is capable of throwing Shinji off without hesitation when his heart is in torment. Misato is shown in this story to be the one with the greatest understanding of Shinji, the one who wants to be his guiding hand. Also, Shinji is the one who truly understands her pain.

  --['From Newtype, March 3 1996 p.4, cover story: Stray Children.'](http://web.archive.org/web/20010211123346/www.acsys.com/~tallman/stray_e.html)

> There's a peculiar thing Shinji does with his Super - DAT Walkman as early as the second episode of EVANGELION: he keeps switching back and forth between tracks 25 and 26 - the numbers of the final two episodes - and when those two episodes arrived, they were undoubtedly the most controversial hour of anime television in recent memory. The uproar over #25, " Do You Love Me? " and #26, " Take Care of Yourself, " was somewhat reminiscent of that over the final two episodes of the British 1960s TV classic THE PRISONER - a series which EVA had already made reference to in episode 4, when Shinji resigns temporarily from NERV. Like the conclusion of THE PRISONER, EVA's ending had a jerking, interrogative style, and seemed to suggest the show was about something else than what it appeared to be at the beginning - and even that the show's legions of fans should re - examine their motives for liking EVA in the first place. Complaints were so numerous over the conclusion that even many Japanese who didn't follow anime heard about the situation, and that this Gainax was a bunch of " bad boys. "

  --<http://web.archive.org/web/20010304203436/j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/03_evangelion/end1.html>

> "No sooner did EVA have its controversial TV ending that Gainax announced it would produce two *more* endings by the spring and summer of 1997: for the video and LD release, it would entirely remake the last two episodes, releasing them as a fourteenth two - episode volume after the first thirteen (as well as remake for the ongoing video release selected scenes in the latter part of the series it was dissatisfied with). There will be a two - part theatrical release to accompany it; one movie will be a compressed " digest " of the series' plot - the other will be the two new episodes. In addition to this, there will be an EVA theatrical movie with an entirely original plot and a *third* ending. Anno indicated at the Expo that these " additional " two endings would in fact really be the same ending as the final TV episode, but from different viewpoints."
>
> ... "Indeed, there seems to be evidence that Anno's dissatisfaction with the original conclusion was more with its often minimalist (if interestingly - handled) visuals, a result of running out of time and budget, than its writing per se: Toshio Okada, in last issue's " Return of the Otaking, " [LINK HERE - SUNDAY MORNING SECTION] spoke of Anno's ambitious plans for a CG - enhanced battle sequence in the remake. Okada also pointed out that Anno has tended to give different rationales concerning the remake, and of late Gainax's own publicity has rather coyly spoken of fan interest being the cause. "

[_End of Evangelion_](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:End_of_Evangelion_Screenplays) translations

> As a matter of fact, Anno is a student of Leni Riefenstahl, and parodied her Triumph of the Will in the Nadia omake. In the spring 1997 issue of Tokion he said regarding the dangerous potential of art: "Nazi Germany was a perfect example. Those guys were making great movies! Even the anti-Nazi propaganda films Disney produced, portrayed Nazis as being fashionable" (He also said of Evangelion in that same interview, "I'm obviously not from a Christian upbringing, so they will have to excuse me for borrowing certain Christian words and images." He didn't say, "They will have to ignore my borrowing them, because they have no meaning whatsoever within the story").

  --<http://lists.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2009-December/005598.html>

> In 1997, shortly after the success of Evangelion and somewhere during pre-production of Kare Kano, Anno participated in a popular NHK show called "Welcome Back for an Extracurricular Lesson, Sempai!", where popular personalities revisit the town they grew up in to teach a class at their old primary schools. For anyone who has peeked into the very, very dark current of thought he vented so readily in Evangelion, the thought of this is impossible not to snicker at.
>
> ... Before Anno arrives, they are to draw and write what they think he's like, based on their thoughts from watching Eva. Puzzled, they just start coming up with silliness.
>
> ... "Why is that robot-thingy called Evangelion?"
>
> "It comes from a Christian word meaning 'Gospel' and it's supposed to bring blessings. It has some Greek roots. I chose the name because it sounds complicated."
>
> "What does Rei like?" Otaku boy asks. "I haven't thought about it," is Anno's curt reply. He's not exactly a verbal person, but he's keenly aware of subtle things that affect how the kids might react to him, so he does things like maintain eye level with them. Anno admits he has a self-esteem problem. "I'm not crazy about myself. I'm often told that those who don't like themselves have high ideals, but I think someone who says that doesn't really understand the pain that's involved," he muses.
>
> "Do you like the anime you make?"
>
> "There's parts I like and parts I don't."
>
> "What parts do you dislike?"
>
> "The parts that I'm in."
>
> ... After a quick school lunch (Anno barely eats, and refuses all meat and fish) The kids are brought by bus into town to interview Anno's parents and childhood friends. [cf. the '96 anime panel]
>
> ... After the kids present their (much improved) animations, Anno wraps up by explaining the point of such free-form exercises. "In school tests, there's only one answer for each question, and you might get zero or half points if you're wrong. But in the real world, things aren't so black and white, so think about things on your own and express them in words or pictures. That's how you communicate with people. That's so important."
>
> ... The power lines, the landscapes of man-made structures -- including many of Anno's visual trademark shots -- are so obviously influenced by these surroundings that we almost expect to see Asuka rounding the corner.

> "There's also both Genesis 0:0 features (0:0 - IN THE BEGINNING and 0:0' - THE LIGHT FROM THE DARKNESS) which are recap and making of pieces, neither very interesting although the first has very brief interviews with Sadamoto Yoshiyuki and Anno Hideaki. There's also a series of brief questions asked of the voices of the three main female characters, Mitsuishi Kotono (Misato), Miyamura Yuko (Asuka), and Hayashibara Megumi (Rei). Also included is a separate collection of short TV spots for the End of Evangelion movie I'd never seen before which were QUITE interesting, I'll put it that way."

>
> AL: Did you get any complaints for using christian concepts ? Angels are supposed to be good, that seems not to be the case in Evangelion.
>
> Anno: I don't know much about the christian religion, and it wasn't my intention to approach it or to criticize whatsoever. Having said that, wasn't Lucifer an angel himself before his fall?
>
> [...]
>
> AL: There seems to be a recurrent message in your series: That no one can live alone, or apart from a group or an ethnic entity [?]. Why such a message to the otaku, although they live in a world relatively apart?
>
> Anno: One can find whatever message he wants to find in any film or series. I didn't want to tell this or that message in particular, but the fact that you think about it like that is already positive. I did Evangelion to please myself and to please the fans of animation, trying to bring together the largest audience possible.

  --<http://lists.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1997-September/003351.html> (Animeland 32 was May 1997); the final Q/A pair has also been [excerpted & translated](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-July/018749.html) from an interview published 18 July 1997 in the Italian magazine _Man-ga!_, suggesting both magazines are translating an unknown _NewType_ interview

> Interview with Anno in French magazine:
> "According to Studio Gainax's press release, when humans fall in love or feel close to their family, the part of the brain labeled A-10 comes into play. Strangely, the pilots of EVAs have to use this part of their brains to "merge" with their EVA. That makes them warriors of LOVE, with the power of LOVE to protect their loved ones."

> "...in an interview, director Anno indicated that Misato's character design is modeled after Tsukino Usagi.  The hair style (sans odango), especially the front, is almost an exact duplication of Usagi.  He has even used the words "Misato is Usagi in her 29th years" (I am not quoting the words here, as I forgot the exact wording).
>
>Ref : Shinseiki Evangelion Kanzen Kouryaku Tokuhon, by Shinseiki Fukuin Kyoukai, ISBN4-380-97219-4

  --<http://lists.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1997-November/002387.html>

> "The part about Misato being inspired by Usagi was mentioned by Sadamoto in the bonus disc of the _Renewal_ as well but only in the regards of her hairs; in that interview he also said that he was inspired by Fujiko Mine from Lupin, he liked the fact that at the same time she seems to be in her 20s and in her 30s."

   --[HyperShinchan](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=471771#471771)

> "In the notes accompanying LD 0:2, it was stated that during the storyboard stage of episode 4, a staff asked Anno what Misato is like, and Anno replied that Misato is just like Tsukino Misato. [error; should be 'Tsukino Usagi']
>
> Anno is a Sailor Moon fans, and he had participated in drawing some cells in episode 46. [see also: "I recall reading one time that Anno himself worked some on Sailor Moon, animated the Outer Senshi's transformation scenes, but I don't know if that is really true or not." <http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1999-January/024692.html>]

> Evangelion was first proposed as a project by Mr. Anno on Sept. 20 1993.
>
> Almost 5 years ago.

> The unique look and feel of Tokyo-03 was strongly influenced by the fact that in 1994 GAiNAX relocated their office to the city of Mitaka (3 Eagles) which gave them a new environment to visualized the the world of Evangelion. "Eva LD Movie Box Set"

>> I've gotten curious enough to ask.  Precisely what is Rei doing in that tank in central dogma?  (I think it's episode 15 or in that neighborhood).

> This was from Shonen A's Sadamoto Yoshiyuki interview:

>> "...there were a lot of holes in the plot. For example, I asked (Hideaki Anno) why only children pilot EVAs. His immediate response was 'Right, I must get this sorted out.', then he got all worked up."

   --[Leonard Tai](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-May/014883.html); TODO was this really from 1997? Maybe there was an interview in 1998 *before* Tai wrote in May 1998 and I am unduly pessimistic about how old his information is?

> Miyazaki: Anyway, I think it's good that you had success with Evangelion. It gives you an opportunity to work and an influential voice. Besides that, escape from the ghost of Evangelion as fast as possible. You can't be "that Mr. Anno who made Evangelion" 10 or 20 years from now.
>
> Anno: I know!
>
> Miyazaki: So, I think you should keep your hands off Evangelion entirely from here on out.
>
> Don't worry about that. The evil spirit has already gone. So, I'm going to do shoujo manga (_His and Her Circumstances_) for now. (laughs)

#### Theatrical pamphlets

Background: <http://wiki.evageeks.org/Movie_Pamphlets>

##### D&R

###### Intro

> "The series [NGE] featured attractive SF settings, dynamic battle scenes, a pedantic flavor from incorporating Christian motifs and psychoanalytical jargon into a dramatic work, and a super-intensive amount of information. Evangelion exceeded the bounds of conventional anime on all these counts, making it truly worthy of the title "Neon Genesis". The series enjoyed the enthusiastic support of numerous fans, and also spawned discussions on various topics.
>
> The TV series ended in a manner that could be considered incomplete. This became an intense issue, and by that meaning could be said to have spurred on Evangelion's popularity. The voice of the fans grew stronger and stronger as they demanded a proper ending to the drama, explanations of the mysteries, or even a new story. In order to meet these expectations, a cinema edition was planned -- this is "EVANGELION DEATH AND REBIRTH".
>
> ...
>
> "REBIRTH" is Part 1 of the "Conclusion" which retells TV episodes 25 and 26 as a new story. Evangelion will conclude by showing this Part 1 together with Part 2 of the Cinema Edition which is scheduled for release this summer."

- <http://www.evaotaku.com/html/dr1-intro.html>

###### Timeline

> "[2001]: Yui and Gendou Ikari have their first child, Shinji. Had the child been a girl, Gendou intended to name her "Rei".
>
>...
>
>[2003]: Fuyutsuki, through his independent research, draws closer to a massive deception surrounding Second Impact, at the fore of which is Gendou Ikari, Chief of Research at the U.N. Artificial Evolution Laboratories (AEL). When Fuyutsuki visits the AEL and threatens Gendou with a public exposé of the truth, Gendou guides Fuyutsuki to Central Dogma -- a gigantic cavity sprawling deep underground the Laboratories. There Fuyutsuki meets Dr. Naoko Akagi, a foremost authority on bio-computers, who calls their organization "Gehirn". Standing before the incomplete EVA-00, Gendou tempts Fuyutsuki, saying, "Won't you create a new future for humankind together with me?" After careful consideration, Fuyutsuki accepts Gendou's offer...
>
> ...
>
> [2010]: Rei Ayanami (the 1st) visits Gehirn. Gendou, who is accompanying her, explains that she is the child of an acquaintance.
>
> MAGI is completed through the efforts of Dr. Naoko Akagi. That same night, Naoko learns from Rei that she is merely a tool for achieving Gendou's plans. In a rage of passion, she strangles Rei and then throws herself from the Command Center and dies."

- <http://www.evaotaku.com/html/dr1-timeline.html>; the interest of 2001 lies in the sibling (and unromantic!) relationship between Shinji & Rei, the interest of 2003 in the 'Laboratories' connection to the Black Moon/Central Dogma and the Proposal's final episode; the interest of 2010 in confirming that Naoko committed suicide

###### Characters

> "She [Asuka Soryu Langley] is one quarter Japanese and German, but her nationality is American. In contrast to Shinji and Rei, she is a bright and active young girl. She hates to lose, and is full of pride. As the battles against the Angels continue, she gradually loses her self-confidence as a pilot, becoming both mentally and physically exhausted.
>
> ...
>
> His [Kaworu Nagisa] birthdate is given as September 13, 2000 -- the same date as Second Impact.
>
> ...
>
> Normally casual and indirect, he [Kaji] rarely shows his true colors. He understands Shinji and Misato, and occasionally offers them advice.
>
> ...
>
> She [Misato] lives with Shinji, and acts as his guardian. During strategic operations she is a bold and daring commander, but normally she is a cheerful optimist who looks after Shinji and the other pilots in the capacity of an older sister. However, she also carries about a past of losing her father due to an Angel, and thus joined NERV to take her revenge on the Angels.
>
> ...
>
> Shinji is an introverted young boy who is awkward at communicating with other people, and harbors doubts as to the value of his own existence. Ordered by his father from whom he had lived apart for over ten years, he piloted EVA-01 and fought against the Angels. He continues to search for his place in life amidst the fierce battles with the Angels.
>
> ...
>
> He [Gendo Ikari] appears cold-blooded and ruthless -- capable of doing anything to achieve his aims -- but there are many mysteries surrounding his conduct.
>
> ...
>
> He [Fuyutsuki Kohzou] is currently a member of NERV as a willing collaborator with Gendou, but his true intentions are unknown.
>
> ...
>
> He [Hyuga Makoto] has an easy-going personality, and appears to harbor some affection toward Misato.
>
> ...
>
> She [Horaki Hikari] has a very down-to-earth character, and takes her responsibilities as Class President seriously. For this reason she is somewhat shunned by the boys in the class. While outwardly apalled at Touji's unmannerly character, she secretly harbors affection toward him, but never says so openly. She is one of Asuka's few friends in Japan.
>
> ...
>
> There appear to be some secrets concerning her [Ikari Yui] death. She met Gendou while in university, and married him soon after graduating. She is also the one who brought together Fuyutsuki and Gendou."

###### Glossary

> "The relation between the actual "Dead Sea Scrolls" and SEELE's "Secret Dead Sea Scrolls" is unclear.
>
> ...
>
> [Instrumentality Project/Human Complementation Project (HCP) (JINRUI HOKAN KEIKAKU)] Like the name implies, this is a project to complement humankind's wanting parts and achieve a "perfect existence". This project was being advanced by the Instrumentality Committee as well as Gendou Ikari and NERV.

> In "REBIRTH", Misato says that it is a project to "artificially evolve Humankind, which has reached its limit as a colony of flawed and separate entities, into a perfect single being." However, it appears that the complementation of humankind envisioned by the elders of SEELE does not equal the complementation aimed for by Gendou and Fuyutsuki.

These pilots are called "Children" (qualified persons), and are identified as First, Second and so on according to the order of their selection. Of these, the First (Rei) and Third (Shinji) Children have extremely similar personal patterns, and Eva crossover tests are even performed between the two. All the candidates for Children are gathered in the New-Tokyo-3 First Municipal Junior High School which Shinji attends, and all members of Class 2-A are in fact candidates. It is not clear why the plural form (CHILDREN) is used instead of the singular form (CHILD). Incidentally, the word CHILD includes various additional meanings such as: embryo, fetus, descendant, product, and even a person who has emerged from a special environment."

> [Kotono Mitsuishi, Misato's seiyuu]: I am truly glad to have met the woman named Misato. Although she doesn't easily speak her true feelings, which often gave me some trouble, I truly like her bright manner by which she hides the loneliness and darkness deep within her heart. After the TV series had ended, I listened to "Cruel Angel's Thesis" again and was struck by the phrase "Although I cannot become a goddess, I will live on." Surely this must be the voice of Misato's heart. I look forward to watching Misato in this cinema edition, as well as seeing who and how Shinji fights.

However, I can't help but feel an endless fascination at the way Eva's story unfolds, tinted by an infinite amount of information amidst drama with needlessly excessive 'fan-service'..."

###### "Refrain"

###### Notes

> "People found a God, and in their folly tried to acquire it. Thus retribution was visited upon mankind."
>
> Ritsuko Akagi thus ridiculed Second Impact -- the greatest calamity since the dawn of history which was visited upon humankind in the final year of the 20th century.
>
> ...
>
> Another "Children", Rei Ayanami, was a manufactured girl -- manufactured to carry out a certain task. She shed the first tears of her life upon realizing that she was "lonely", but then died in battle immediately thereafter. A third Rei was prepared at once -- a new Rei who knew not the reason for her tears.
>
> "Piloting Eva is all I have."
>
> The dedicated pilot of EVA-02, Sohryu Asuka Langley's pride was sustained by piloting Eva. Losing her mother at a young age had made her choose "strength" as her raison d'être. The strength of being needed by those around her, and yet not needing anyone around her.
>
> But Asuka had been beaten -- by Shinji, by the Angels, and by herself.
>
> Having lost the ability to pilot Eva, she lost her sense of worth -- a broken person.
>
> ...
>
> "Yes, worthy of friendship."
>
> The Fifth Children, Kaworu Nagisa, achieved a chance meeting with Shinji, and conveyed his friendship. Kaworu's words gently opened up Shinji's heart, which had shut itself away in its shell. But Kaworu's true identity was that of the final Angel -- the enemy of humankind.
>
> ...
>
> The Angel's name was Kaworu Nagisa -- The first person to ever tell Shinji that he liked him. And the first person to whom Shinji ever opened up his heart. Having killed Kaworu by his own hand, Shinji shut away his heart once again and implored Asuka to help him. Asuka - the spirited young girl who had always made fun of him. But Asuka's pride had been shattered, and she did not respond. On the other hand, the death of the last Angel meant the completion of SEELE's scenario. To artificially evolve Humankind which has reached its limit as a colony of flawed and separate entities into a perfect single being -- that was the true meaning of the Instrumentality Project (HCP), and was also synonymous with Third Impact.
>
> ...
>
> What does Gendou plan in the midst of this hopeless situation. What will SEELE's scenario bring to pass? Is there a future for Asuka, lying curled up like an unborn child inside the unmoving EVA-02? What runs through Ritsuko's head as she smiles coldly inside MAGI? And Misato dashing through the battlefield that was once NERV HQ -- will she make it in time? The clashing of various people's wills amidst a complex battle resembles a council that will decide humanity's future. Evolution and death, stagnation and birth, truth and lies -- and the future chosen by humankind? "

##### D&R Special Edition (2)

###### Commentary

> "From the initial planning stages, this series has evolved around its director Hideaki Anno, and it could be said that all aspects from the basic concept to the conclusion bear the mark of Anno's creative individuality.
>
> ...
>
> Evangelion became centered on the theme of "people's hearts" from around the middle of the TV series. As the culmination of this trend, the climax of the series, episodes 25 "Owaru sekai (Ending World)" and 26 "Sekai no chuushin de ai wo sakenda kemono (The Beast who Shouted "I/Love" at the Center of the World)", took an experimental and shocking approach in that the story developed within the inner worlds of the main characters. While this climax may have fulfilled the basic thematic requirements, it left the mysteries presented thus far mostly unsolved, and gave a strong impression of having ended with the story incomplete.
>
> This ending became an intense issue, and by that meaning could be said to have spurred on Evangelion's popularity. The voice of the fans grew stronger and stronger as they demanded a proper ending to the drama, explanations of the mysteries, or even a new story. In order to meet these expectations, a cinema edition was planned -- this is "EVANGELION DEATH AND REBIRTH".
>
> ...
>
> "REBIRTH" is Part 1 of the "Conclusion" which retells TV episodes 25 and 26 as a new story. It was originally intended that Evangelion would conclude only with "REBIRTH", but the story content increased as production progressed, so "REBIRTH" is being released as only Part 1 of the conclusion. Evangelion will conclude by showing "REBIRTH" together with Part 2 of the Cinema Edition which is scheduled for release this summer."

###### Terminology

> Their English name is not APOSTLE (= SHITO), but ANGEL (= TENSHI). To be sure, Sachiel, Shamshel, Ramiel and the other names given to the Angels except for the 1st Angel Adam are all angel names. Further, just as the name of the 6th Angel which appeared from the ocean is that of "fish" angel, Gaghiel, and the name of the 10th Angel which plummeted down from satellite orbit is that of "sky" angel, Sahaquiel, the names of the Angels bear a mysterious symbolism with the attributes, place of initial confirmation, and conditions of appearance of each Angel. Unlike the style of the angels recorded in the Bible. which are generally believed to "have wings, wear white robes, and have an angelic halo about their heads," these Angels come in varying shapes and sizes including humanoid and animal-like forms, giving rise to the speculation that the Angels do not have a specific form, or are amorphous.

However, when selecting the Fourth Children, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi referred to Touji Suzuhara as "a child for whom a core can be prepared." This suggests the fact that NERV can "prepare" cores, and further that an individual core is prepared for each pilot.

> Many cross-like images are used in Evangelion: the explosions caused by the Angels, Misato's pendant, the stop signal plug inserted into the berserked EVA-00, the cross used to transport Eva-03, the pillar on which Lilith is crucified underground, etc. The cross is widely known as the symbol of Christianity, but before Christ it was nothing more than an implement of punishment used to bring about a painful death, and it was the death of Jesus Christ that transformed it into the embodiment of love and forgiveness and the symbol of self-sacrifice. However, in prehistoric times the cross was widely used to symbolize the sun, the heavens and the wind. So, is the meaning of the cross in Evangelion derived from Christ or from before Christ?

###### Timeline

- <http://www.evaotaku.com/html/dr2-timeline.html>

###### Production notes

> In addition to selecting the used episodes and scenes, the series of image scenes where Shinji and the others play instruments in the school gymnasium, and linking the various scenes in a shuffled manner rather than simply arranging them in order were also the ideas of Akio Satsukawa.
>
> ...
>
> Approximately 30 minutes of "DEATH" were newly produced. These contents can be divided into the following three patterns. First is the series of image scenes where Shinji and the others play instruments in the school gymnasium. This is original film shown only in "DEATH". Second is retakes of the TV series film. Third are the scenes scheduled to be added as new cuts to the video release versions of episodes 22 to 24.
>
> ...
>
> The third type was the scenes scheduled to be added as new cuts to the video release versions of episodes 22 to 24. Work proceeded on these cuts separately from this cinema edition. These include the scene where Yui talks with Fuyutsuki while appeasing the infant Shinji, Asuka's monologue in the bathroom, Kaji and Asuka's dialog before meeting Shinji and the others, etc.
>
> ...
>
> Production of "REBIRTH" initially started as a remake of episodes 25 and 26 of the TV series Evangelion, that is to say as the conclusion to Evangelion. However, the content grew much larger than planned during the course of production, with the two episodes together totaling almost 70 minutes in length. Therefore, it was decided to start with a theater release of the first half corresponding to episode 25.
>
> ...
>
> After the storyboard work for "REBIRTH" had been finished, Chief Director Anno started work on Part 2 of the movie edition corresponding to TV episode 26. A separate team was also assembled for the artwork of episode 26, and work proceeded in parallel with episode 25.

- <http://www.evaotaku.com/html/dr2-prodnotes.html>

###### Notes

> Episode 25' "Air" is based on the original episode 25 script which was completed during production of the TV series.  Due to production time limits and other problems, this script was not used and the TV episode 25 "Owaru sekai (The Ending World)" instead became a drama which unfolded within an inner universe like episode 26.  In this sense, episode 25' could be considered a return to the originally intended contents.  In contrast, episode 26' adds much more story and dramatic content to TV episode 26, thus deepening the theme.
>
> This movie was created as the remake of the last two TV episodes, so the TV episode format is followed, with each episode having its own subtitle and eyecatch scenes.
>
> ...
>
> Some real-life shots were used to depict the inner universe of Shinji in episode 26', and a team called the "Special Production Team" was formed to film these shots.  Hideaki Anno also wrote the script and served as chief director for these parts, with Shinji Higuchi participating in the role of special effects director.  "Special effects director" in this context means directing the filming of special effects.  The actual filming proceeded with Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi mutually discussing their ideas and opinions of each shot.
>
> ...
>
> The other song is the insert song "Komm, süsser Tod" used in episode 26'.  The lyrics are the English translation of words composed by Chief Director Anno.  The title is German, meaning "Come, Sweet Death".  The vocalist is Arianne, and composition and arrangement are by Shiro Sagisu.

##### Red Cross Book

###### Commentary

> For the TV series, episodes 25 "Owaru sekai (The Ending World)" and 26 "Sekai no chuushin de ai wo sakenda kemono (The Beast who Shouted "I/Love" at the Center of the World)" were shown following episode 24 to conclude the series.  Thus, the story of Evangelion branches into two after the last scene of episode 24.  There is one ending as shown in TV episodes 25 and 26, while episodes 25' and 26' as shown in "THE END OF EVANGELION" are another ending.  (Here, plain numbers are used to indicate the TV episodes, and numbers with apostrophes for the movie episodes)

>
> From the initial planning stages through this cinema edition, Neon Genesis Evangelion has evolved around its director Hideaki Anno.  All aspects from the overall theme and framework of the story down to each individual drawing and line of dialogue bear the mark of Anno's creative individuality.
>
> ...
>
> The show's soaring popularity rivaled the biggest hits of the past such as "Star Blazers (Space Battleship Yamato)" and "Mobile Suit Gundam (Kidou Senshi Gundamu)", giving rise to the phrase "the Eva phenomenon".
>
> ...
>
> Episodes 25' (Air) and 26' (Magokoro wo, kimi ni) are packed with breathtaking cinematic scenes: the drama of the characters, action scenes, solutions to mysteries, etc.  On the other hand the movie also takes an experimental approach which deals squarely with the issue of "people's hearts" in the same manner as the climax to the TV series.  Thus, in both name and fact, this is the complete conclusion to Neon Genesis Evangelion.

###### Glossary

> Although the personalities of these three Rei differ from one another, this is due to environmental factors.  Their soul is one and the same, and it appears to have been that of Lilith.  At the final stage of the Instrumentality Project, Rei betrayed Gendou, returned to Lilith of her own judgment and entrusted the future to Gendou's son -- Shinji Ikari.

> Introverted in character, he is concerned about how he is viewed by others.  Further, he is awkward at expressing himself and communicating with others, so he repeatedly evades confrontation and disobeys orders.

They take various sizes and shapes: from a giant octahedron to a minute Angel the size of bacteria, or even a "shadow" Angel without tangible form.  Borrowing Fuyutsuki's words in episode 26', it seems that Angels are beings which got the "Fruit of Life" whereas humanity got the "Fruit of Wisdom".  In other words, "Angels" are another form of humankind with the same potential as humans.  Thus, humans are the 18th Angel.

It was promoted under the direction of SEELE, with Special Agency NERV as the implementing organization.  However, it seems that SEELE's objective differed from that of NERV -- that is to say of Gendou and Fuyutsuki.  Eva was not actually built as a weapon, but instead with the aim of realizing this project.  Specifically, this appears to have been a project to artificially initiate Third Impact, thus eliminating all of humanity who, after shedding their human forms, would then evolve to a new stage.

###### Tsurumaki interview

> I honestly think it would have been best simply to end it with the TV series.  Frankly speaking, I feel that everything after that was a bit of unnecessary work, although I guess normally one should feel happy about having their work made into a movie.
>
> ...
>
> It felt really good toward the end -- after finishing the work for episode 16, and especially from episode 20 onward.  Of course, physically I was dead tired, but my mind was still sharp as a knife.  I felt that I was utilizing my natural abilities to their maximum potential.
>
> ...
>
> -- Episode 16 made quite an impression, and seemed to mark a turning point for Evangelion.
>
> KT - That's because it was the first episode where the direction of drawing from the inside like that appeared.
>
>
> -- I see.
>
> KT - The first draft of the scenario was actually a dialog between Shinji and the Angel.  However, we felt it would be too anti-climactic to have an Angel start talking like some pulp fiction alien (speaks while tapping his Adam's apple with his hand) "Your analog mode of thought is incorrect."  So we came up with the idea actually used in this episode, which was to have Shinji converse with himself.
>
>
> -- There was a line in that dialogue -- something like, "We can't weave our lives only out of things we like...."  That line was pretty intense.  I would have thought it would strike right to the heart of anime fans, but there was almost no reaction from anyone.  (laugh)
>
> KT - Well, most people don't pay close attention to the dialog when watching a TV anime.  That is to say, we hear the words, but they don't enter our minds.  I'm that way too.  Hideaki Anno understands this, and started to incorporate expressions that convey the message to the viewers in a more direct manner.  Thus, elements which attempted to somehow convey the message within the bounds of the story gradually became fewer, and expressions which were more introspective or emotionally expressive became more frequent.
>
> ...
>
> It was probably about then that we began to see the direction of "Eva" -- that we were moving toward that kind of introspective story.  That's why we made Part A of episode 16 like a normal story.  By this meaning, the boundary between Parts A and B of episode 16 could be considered the dividing line between the front and back of "Evangelion".
>
> ...
>
> KT - I didn't mind it.  The schedule was an utter disaster and the number of cels plummeted, so there were some places where unfortunately the quality suffered.  However, the tension of the staff as we all became more desperate and frenzied certainly showed up in the film.
>
> ...
>
> KT - About the time that the production system was completely falling apart, there were some opinions to the effect that, "If we can't do satisfactory work, then what's the point of continuing?"  However, I didn't feel that way.  My opinion was, "Why don't we show them the entire process including our breakdown."  You know -- make it a work that shows everything including our inability to create a satisfactory product. I figured that, "In 10 years or so, if we look back on something that we made while we were drunk out of our minds, we wouldn't feel bad even if the quality wasn't so good."
>
> ...
>
> -- I see.  Then, it's true that Shinji's feelings are Director Anno's feelings?
>
> KT - To tell the truth I'm not sure, but at the very least I tried to work on the project from that viewpoint.  That's why in the scenario planning sessions I was always saying something like, "Isn't that a little too hero-like for Shinji to say?  Hideaki Anno isn't that much of a hero."
>
>
> -- In episode 25' Shinji becomes completely despondent. Does this mean that Director Anno had also experienced that?
>
> KT - I think Hideaki Anno's tension after the TV series had ended had probably fallen to about that level.

>
> -- Was this cinema edition made to match Director Anno's state of mind?
>
> KT - I believe so.  There was a time when Hideaki Anno clearly wanted to attempt a more cathartic development. It didn't end up that way, but I don't think we lied.
>
>
> -- When you say "lie", do you mean to suddenly conclude with something like "love saved the world"?
>
> KT - Exactly.  And we didn't do that with this movie.  I feel no dissatisfaction at the ending.  I really like it.
>
>
> -- At the end of this movie, Shinji seems to have reached a sort of settlement regarding troubles of the heart.
>
> KT - Well, my personal view is, "Do we really need to complement these troubles of the heart?"  Regardless of whether or not we are complemented, have troubles, or find our answers, interpersonal relations exist, and the world goes on.  I thought the last scene meant to say that life goes on, but I could be wrong.
>
>
> -- In the end, Evangelion was a story about communication -- at least judging from that last scene.
>
> KT - That was the intent from the start of the TV series.  That was what I tried to produce from episode 2 onward.
>
>
> -- Yes, that was the scene where Misato and Shinji talk while measuring distances from each other in Misato's apartment, right?  Although they appeared to be getting along fine with each other, Shinji was thinking, "She seems okay, but....", while Misato was thinking "I wonder if he sees through me?"
>
> KT - there were other scenes in episode 2 as well.  For instance, when Misato talks to Shinji but doesn't enter his room.  Even in episode 3, they are having a casual morning conversation, but are not looking at each other.  Like they looking through a slightly opened door, but not connecting.  This is the same between Shinji and Rei, and between Shinji and his father.  It's no wonder there was a lot of distant, awkward communication.
>
>
> -- I see.  So, the theme remained the same throughout the series?
>
> KT - That's right.
>
> ...
>
> -- Now even businessmen are debating the mysteries of "Eva" in bars.  (laugh)
>
> KT - (laugh)  For example, Hideaki Anno says that, "Anime fans are too introverted, and need to get out more."  Further, he should be happy that non-anime fans are watching his work, right?  But when all is said and done, Hideaki Anno's comments on "Evangelion" + "Evangelion" are that it is a message aimed at anime fans including himself, and of course, me too.  In other words, it's useless for non-anime fans to watch it.  If a person who can already live and communicate normally watches it, they won't learn anything.
>
>
> -- But, don't all the people watching "Evangelion" now actually have this type of anime-fan complex?  Doesn't everyone share some feelings of uneasiness at not being able to get along with the world.
>
> KT - Yes, maybe that's so.  Hideaki Anno's statements certainly are true when looking at the small circle of anime fans, but stepping back and looking at the much wider circle of Japanese people in general, we may find many of the same types of problems. They're not problems specific to just anime fans.

###### Seiyuu comments

> [Megumi Ogata (Shinji Ikari)] I sometimes felt a loathing when I held the script.
>
> And was shocked to realize that this loathing was towards a part of me.
>
> Pain as I peeled away the scabs from my heart one after another.
>
> The fear of breaking down.
>
> Rejection, despair, pleasure, rapture, aversion....
>
> It was all so real -- it was live.
>
> A strip show that was more embarrassing than actually taking off my clothes.
>
> 3 years during which I unmistakably faced "Me".
>
>
> I thought that when the story was over, I would be able to view it somewhat objectively -- but I couldn't. Because it was still continuing -- because I am alive -- because the people I like are alive. So I think that I will surely repeat over and over as I gasp for breath amidst a certain peace of sorts. Foolish pursuits -- and the pursuit of an irresistible love.
>
> ...
>
> [Kotono Mitsuishi (Misato Katsuragi)] I am truly glad to have met her. It was difficult playing Misato Katsuragi even during the TV series -- because she is a person who doesn't easily speak her true feelings. During scenes where her feelings exploded or she poured out her heart, I also became a bit over-emotional and afterwards couldn't remember exactly what kind of performance I had given (- not a good thing). My hands shook and it took all my might to keep the script I was holding from rustling and making noise. (Times like these make me feel that voice acting is a bit restricting.) I have focused exclusively on Misato for so long -- wanting to know her, to get close to her -- concentrating all of my five senses on her. That's the way I am, so I am unable to objectively look at "Eva" right now after finishing the voice-over work. My perspective is still on the same level as Misato, but I feel that's fine. In episode 25' "Air" she was strong, brave and a woman. The sole survivor of Second Impact 15 years earlier, her cross necklace is the keepsake of her father. I wonder if it's just me who feels that she alone survived in order to give that cross to Shinji?
>
> ...
>
> [Yuuko Miyamura (Sohryu Asuka Langley)] Evangelion has finally reached its conclusion.... Congratulations, everyone, on a job well done. No, really -- Thank you very much. 24 years ago as I gave my birthing cries in Kobe, surely not even Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto of the combined fleet or Nostradamus could have predicted that I would participate in the project called Evangelion. Evangelion's popularity is unstoppable -- like the raid on Pearl Harbor. I'm sure that every Eva fan with a Japanese Spirit will feel like singing none other than "Off to Sea" from "Sally Forth" as they watch this conclusion. If so, then I'd like to send everyone to the theater with a big cheer of "Banzai!" In case you couldn't tell, I think I had a "Kamikaze" feeling during the voice-over. (heart) Haha... (heart) Well done everyone.
>
> ...
>
> [Yuriko Yamaguchi (Ritsuko Akagi)] Ritsuko fades away with her final word, "Liar." But what was this "Liar" in reference to? The script for this last scene only has Gendo saying: "Ritsuko Akagi, I truly...." followed by Ritsuko saying: "Liar (gets shot)". I can imagine many words that might follow "I truly....", but I can't decide on any in particular. That is the complexity of Gendou and Ritsuko's relationship.
>
> From Ritsuko Akagi's inner feelings as a scientist, she could be considered a woman who blindly gave her love to Gendou Ikari, and also a foolish woman that walked the same path as her mother Naoko who committed suicide after being betrayed by Ikari. I personally wanted her to end as a convenient, submissive woman who simply wanted to die righteously. But in the previous movie (D&R) she ended as a deeply jealous woman filled with nothing but hatred toward Ikari.
>
> Feeling unsatisfied with this, I looked for a way to accept her death at the hands of Ikari. This made the interpretation of "Liar" very important. But the voice-over grew nearer and nearer....
>
> Director Anno must have noticed how I felt. When it came time to do the voice-over, he showed me a single, hidden hint at the last moment. With that one incredible hint, I, and Ritsuko Akagi, were utterly defeated. It hardly needs saying, but Director Anno is incredible. Truly awesome -- a genius.
>
> ...
>
> [Fumihiko Tatsuki (Gendou Ikari)] I feel that the more I say about Evangelion, the more I am "living the wrong way." However, as long as I can liberate the feelings in my heart, I feel that my performances as a "voice actor involved with Eva" might not be merely a bunch of fine plays and bloopers, but rather a series of mysterious and concealed performances. Although I took the approach of not exaggerating emotional expression in playing the role of Gendou Ikari, I did my best to squeeze out every ounce of power I could given my present abilities so as not to be overshadowed by the incredible detail and overall high level of this anime.
>
> I cannot find words enough to thank Director Anno for stolidly watching over this forlorn role...
>
> ...
>
> [Motomu Kiyokawa (Kouzou Fuyutsuki)] I was riding the subway about the time of the spring theater release (D&R), and overheard three junior high school aged kids discussing Evangelion. The discussion basically took the course of: "That part means such and such," "No, I disagree," and so on. There haven't been very many anime works that people have really discussed, and I think this is one of the great things about Eva.
>
> I feel that even when acting on stage, the type of drama that makes the audience feel and think various things is interesting drama, and also good drama. Of course, the audience won't imagine anything if the drama is devoid of content. Director Anno created many such places in Evangelion where the audience can imagine things. That's why I think it is great. Being able to interpret something in various ways means that much effort has been put into the pictures and story.
>
> ...
>
> [Akira Ishida (Kaworu Nagisa)] Starting from nothing more than this perception, the character of Kaworu Nagisa began to express itself with each passing day. The circumstances surrounding Kaworu Nagisa established him as a navigator for delving into the labyrinth of Evangelion, and give new insight into its unspoken meaning.
>
> ...
>
> Luckily, however, this time I was able to associate myself with Evangelion as Kaworu to the very end. Was Kaworu's choice correct? Did Kaworu really "keep on living"? While this answer appears to have been entrusted to Shinji, I am honestly happy to have been lucky enough to see it through to the end with my own eyes.

###### Notes
####### Episode 25' - Air

> SEELE immediately instructs Gendou and Fuyutsuki to complete the Project using Eva-01, but the two are reluctant to carry out a plan that will bring about the death of all people, and they rebut SEELE's wishes.
>
> ...
>
> Sohryu Asuka Langley had lost everything. Her mother, her confidence, her pride, and even the will to live
>
> ...
>
> Inside Eva's womb, Asuka realizes that she is with her mother -- that her mother is by her side. The swarming enemy are no longer a match for Asuka, and even the nine Eva series units cannot stop her. Eva-02 careens valiantly across the battlefield, soaring, crushing, toppling, stabbing, strangling, kicking, sweeping, shooting, striking, running, stopping, and stopped... its operational limit reached. The nine Eva series units alight on top of the motionless Eva-02 -- and the violation of Eva by Eva begins.
>
> ...
>
> Misato and Shinji rush through gunfire and smoke; two people with a delicate relationship: mother and son, older sister and younger brother, lovers, adult and child, superior and subordinate.... Shots ring out! As Misato covers Shinji, her legs buckle and the two tumble toward the back of the passageway. Tears and anger mix, and naked emotions clash. Choked words, exasperation, the baring of one's heart, affection, and the meeting of two people's lips -- passing from a mere brushing of lips to an adult kiss. In many ways, Misato was Shinji's first woman.
>
> "We'll do the rest when you get back..." were her words, but Shinji knew there would be no "rest", for Misato's still warm hands and lips were covered with blood...

- <http://www.evaotaku.com/html/rcb-notes.html>

####### Episode 26' - Magokoro wo, kimi ni

> Shinji screamed at seeing the brutally violated form of Eva-02. The howls of Eva-01 create maelstroms inside the Geofront, and Shinji's rage calls back the Lance of Longinus from the Moon. This was also the trigger for starting the two Projects -- the Instrumentality Projects of SEELE and of Gendou. Having regained the Lance, SEELE aims to achieve the Instrumentality (Complementation) of humankind through the indiscriminate death of all life and prayer
>
> ...
>
> On the other hand, deep underground NERV Headquarters which is being laid bare by the JSSDF's attack, Gendou Ikari stands together with Rei before Lilith in Terminal Dogma. Gendou has brought Rei to Lilith to attempt the forbidden joining of Adam and Lilith. Two Instrumentality Projects being executed simultaneously in the heavens and in the bowels of the earth. Will people achieve complementation in either case...? The answer lies within Eva-01....
>
> ...
>
> On the other hand, there were also humans who took the Fruit of Life at that time. These are the Angels -- a different possibility who will fight for the future; another form of human.
>
> ...
>
> People are surrounded by emptiness... And loneliness fills their hearts. And when humans' history reaches its conclusion, Gendou Ikari will be reunited with his wife. Yui Ikari -- the woman who loved a man unworthy of love. Did the Instrumentality Project exist to bring her back? Instrumentality (Complementation) for Gendou could only mean the resurrection of Yui. Having achieved this eagerly awaited reunion, Gendou confesses that he was "afraid" -- afraid that contact with his son would only hurt his son. The hedgehog's dilemma whereby the nearer we draw to one another, the more we hurt each other. This may be the nature of people who estrange themselves from each other using barriers of the heart. Gendou was also this type of weak person. Like his son, Shinji, he was nothing more than a cowardly, weak man. With his last words "Forgive me... Shinji," Gendou is crushed by the jaws of Eva-01. Was this the retribution toward a man who kept running from the world, or was it also his salvation...?
>
> ...
>
> "Do you really think you understand me!? It makes me uneasy! That's the easiest way not to get hurt. Let me hear your voice! You're all you have! Care about me! You don't understand anything, you IDIOT! I'm afraid this way. Don't come near me anymore... But ambiguity only makes me insecure. No. Help me! I think you can save me. Maybe I won't be needed again someday. How pathetic... It unsettles me. That is so ARROGANT! I tried to understand... I get so pissed off whenever I look at you! Then be nice to me. If you want to do it with me, get down on your knees and beg! You're all just hiding behind a smile! You're only using me as an escape... Don't leave me alone! You've never really liked anyone! Don't kill me! ........ No..." [Mostly quoted from the "Komm Susser Tod" scene; a mix of Asuka & Shinji lines.]

   --<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/2001-March/039346.html>

Gainax [initially proposed](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/19981202185145/http://www.ex.org/2.4/11-news.html) EVANGELION: REBIRTH 2 as the title:

> The End of Evangelion Movie Poster The poster reads: "Wouldn't it be nice if everyone would just die?" (Image © 1997 Gainax/Eva Production Committee)
>
> THE END OF EVANGELION is nigh on 19 July
>
> Toei announced 19 July as scheduled premiere date for the eclectic SF drama NEON GENESIS EVANGELION's theatrical finale, THE END OF EVANGELION (Japanese title: "SHIN SEIKI EVANGELION GEKIJOUBAN: Air/MAGOKORO O, KIMI NI." Gainax initially proposed EVANGELION: REBIRTH 2 as the title). This planned 70-minute feature will begin with the incomplete 27-minute Rebirth portion from March's NEON GENESIS EVANGELION: DEATH AND REBIRTH (SHIN SEIKI EVANGELION GEKIJOUBAN: SHI TO SHINSEI) film and finish with new animation.

The full poster reads:

    Wouldn't it be nice if everyone would just die?

    ocean of hopelessness
    fragile souls
    devious smiles
    morbid objects
    self-destruction
    cruel strangers
    replacement of the opposite sex
    immediate cure
    spreading enfeeblement
    wish for nothingness
    imprisoned ego
    fear for separation
    one-sided mistakes
    fright of strangers
    dangerous thoughts
    denial with strangers
    aversion to harmony
    arrogant understanding
    pity for the weak
    uneasy photographs
    scars from the past
    blurred borders
    divergence of common sense
    lonely people
    question of value
    fusion with desire
    return into the womb
    empty time
    decline of yearning
    needless me

    beginning of fabrications
    continuation of reality
    that's the end of the dream

    Then,
    why are you here?

    ...do you really want to stay here?
    The End of Evangelion Neon Genesis Evangelion The Movie Air/My Purest Heart for You

    Random women's voices:
    You don't really know if it's love until after the infatuation stops.
    Men just want a mother figure who'll spoil them.
    Men...You doit with them once and they think they own you.
    Ritsuko?
    Yeah, that's okay,too.
    You'll be sorry for that.
    That's not romantic in the least.
    Men are all scum...

> The tentative title for episode 26, in the first drafts of the overall story, was "Tatta Hitotsu no, Saeta Yarikata". "Tatta Hitotsu no Saeta Yarikata" is the Japanese title of "the Only Neat Thing to Do" by James Tiptree Jr.

  --<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/2001-March/039361.html>

> 'Alice Sheldon, writing as James Tiptree Jr., wrote a clear lineal descendant of "The Cold Equations," called "The Only Neat Thing to Do", (not available online) in 1985. The 1950s had made way for the 1980s and in this story the young female protagonist makes the decision for herself. The situation is somewhat different; she is alone in a spaceship with a parasitical alien that could be a danger to her world if she returns, so she does the "only neat thing" by heading outward forever, in effect committing suicide by eventual diminution of resources. As Godwin did, Tiptree stacked the deck to make only one neat thing available to her protagonist.'

  --<http://www.strangehorizons.com/2005/20050919/notkin-c.shtml>

>> In short, while I can understand why the Japanese translated Flowers for Algernon to something like "Honestly for You" or "Yours Truly," I can't understand why someone would translate it back to English as "My  Purest Heart for You."
>
> But Gainax states on their webpage that it translates as "For you, my heart and soul" so, just deal with it. Pure heart for you, IS a translation of the Kanji. Spoken Japanese, and Written Japanese are different!

   --<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-October/021412.html>

> "Magokoro o kimine" is the Japanese title for "Flowers for Algernon" when it was translated and published in Japan. Project Eva/Mr. Anno decided to use the "Magokoro o kimine" as the movie title stated in the liner note.

   --<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-October/021406.html>

> Title "Do you love me" (episode 25) came from British Psychologist R.D. Ren's (?) essay title. [Also based on liner notes]

   --<http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-October/021356.html>

> The song Komm Susser Todd (German for "Come Sweet Death") used for the film, The End of Evangelion: Episode 26' - Sincerely Yours, is an English translation of Director Hideaki Anno's original Japanese lyrics.

  --<http://www.evaotaku.com/omake/Komm.html>

> From the beginning, everyone has been saying that the "Death" part of "Death and Rebirth" is a "perfect collection" of the TV series, but it wasn't an easy-to-understand digest edition, as in "Space Battleship Yamato" and "Mobile Soldier Gundam."
>
> Ignoring the timeline of the TV series, the psychological condition of the main characters is shown.... Shocking and exciting scenes are put together as if just randomly shuffled, and nowhere do we see the introduction, development, turn, and conclusion [as in a well-composed Chinese poem]. This is a somewhat unkind thing to do to people who have never seen the TV series. "Death and Rebirth" could be labeled "No first-time customers" because of this.
>
> [Note: "No first-time customers" is a sign on some very conservative restaurants in Japan that only take regular customers and people introduced by regulars.]
>
> The completely new section "Rebirth", is a 24 part continuation -- a story that replaces the final two episodes which gave rise to all sorts of public criticism.
>
> ... An animated TV series (with 26 episodes) broadcast on TV Tokyo Channel from October '95 to March '96. The ratings were only 7.1%, but bit by bit from the second half on it moved up to a central place by word of mouth, and after the broadcasts ended it extended into even more of a boom. The movie is a continuation of the TV series.
>
> ... This story is told primarily from the point of view of Shinji Ikari, who was suddenly called to become an Eva pilot against his will by his father, Gendou Ikari, who is the commander of Nerve. Shinji is convinced that he was abandoned by his father when he was very young, and he is extremely frightened by contact with strangers. Also, everyone around him at Nerve likewise carries a wound in their heart and a sickness in their soul.
>
> ... The final two episodes of the TV series were 25 and 26. The story suddenly totally abandons what had been foreshadowed up to that point, its SF-style development, etc., and ends by depicting only the inner world of the protagonist, Shinji Ikari. Shinji gets a psychological breakthrough, and the curtain closes with the other characters saying "Congratulations" to him. It also includes things like rough, graffiti-like art, and forms of expression so far from normal you can't even call it "experimental"; this kind of ending, with fans instantly spouting out arguments pro and con, became one reason for the increasingly widespread popularity of Eva.
>
> A 30-billion yen anime?
>
> At any rate, related software was selling and selling. The video LD has totaled over 2.5 million in sets of 10 disks, the sound-track edition (album) has sold over one million in sets of three, the three-volume collected comics and the nine-volume film books have totaled 7.7 million copies, and 1.23 million people have gone to see the movie "Neon Genesis Evangelion Movie: Death and Rebirth" from when it was released in March.
>
> Besides this, if we add in the plastic models and related goods, it easily breaks through the 30 billion yen mark. Furthermore, the TV series video LDs are not yet all sold and the movie edition packages are not yet on sale. Who can say how long the sales will continue?
>
> ... Someone connected to the consumer electronics industry said they are hoping "it will become a trigger for the spread of DVD," and so on July 19th volume 1 of the Eva videos will be offered for sale. In the first period of five volumes, episodes 1-20 of the TV series will be recorded four to a volume, and they will be released one per month.
>
> ... If it really becomes a "trigger," this will be one more thing to increase the legend of Eva.
>
> ... As with Megumi Hayashibara of "Ranma 1/2," and Kotono Mitsuishi and Aya Hisakawa of "Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon" before, a group of new, nearly "untouched" voice actors have grown along with their production and have been enjoying immense popularity.
>
> Among the ranks of the "Eva" players, one could say that Yuko Miyamura matches this pattern. As almost the only "new person", she has made her break in the role of Asuka Langley Souryuu in a difficult lone battle. It could well be said that her energy had no small part in bringing about Eva's popularity.
>
> ... Miyamura: I'm still really new to television series and there were always more experienced actors around me. Especially in Eva with its adult drama, I have learned a lot from the acting and many talents of the experienced actors.
>
> Also, because Asuka was completely finished by losing her mind in the TV series, I also got into a similar mental state; the stress built up and I suffered from bulimia for a while.

Differences from EoE: pyramid/playground scene suggests little girl is Asuka & mother is Misato or Yui
                      2 'elementary school' scenes for Shinji & Asuka
                      describes Maya, while hugging Rei-Ritsuko, as with a 'false smile'
                      includes live-action mini-film
                      includes Last A and Last B endings - and not actual
Wiki translation of apparent same script: <http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:End_of_Evangelion_Screenplays>

Cut live-action Asuka scene; covers 2 unused EoE endings:
>         Last A
>
>
>
>         You already know the beginning of this one (a beach, petrified headless Evas, etc).
>
>         Thew, we see the graves Shinji made (it's stated by Anno it was _he_ who made them). The names of all main Eva characters are written on them, except for "Ayanami Rei".
>
>         We then see Asuka's grave.
>
>         And Asuka's foot kicking it to the ground. ^^;
>
>         (you can still see these graves in the actual ending... no names, but there is Misato's pendant nailed on one of them, and an other has been kicked down ^^ )
>
>         We then see Shinji and Asuka on the beach... and you know that scene, too (but this draft demonstrates that Shinji and Asuka didn't just wake up there after Third Impact... they've been living here for some times... meaning they _could_ be the two only humans willing to return, after all... ^^; )
>
>         When Shinji starts crying, Asuka was supposed to say something like "Idiot. No way I'll let you kill me" ("idiot" was removed in the storyboards... and the whole line was modified, eventually).
>
>
>
>         Then, the ending music (so, there was one... ^^ ) was supposed to begin, and the staff credits were to appear (Anno suggests a horizontal scrolling, like in GunBuster, I guess).
>
>         We were to see Eva-01 lying on the Moon, and woman's hair showing from its broken mask (but her face remains unseen).
>
>         Behind Eva-01, you could see Earth, entirely red.
>
>         And the Black Moon, destroyed.
>
>         The camera goes to the sun, then to the stars.
>
>         Credits end.
>
>         "Shûgeki" ("the end").
>
>
>
> Now the true ending is based upon Last A. Last B is slightly different.
>
>
>
>         Last B
>
>
>
>         It begins like the previous one, but Asuka doesn't show up in the "graves scene".
>
>         We then see Shinji lying on the beach.
>
>         His right hand is holding a white one.
>
>         "I'll never see them again."
>
>         "It's better to think of it this way."
>
>         "I'm still alive, so I'll keep on living."
>
>         He squeezes the hand harder.
>
>         Then, he sees Rei (like in the actual episode and Last A).
>
>         We eventually see that there is nobody lying near Shinji. Just a white arm without the rest of the body.
>
>         The camera then shows the full moon.
>
>         The ending credits are the same as in Last A.

> 'PS. By the way the TV CM (commercial) for the EoE movie is quite strange..... a mish-mash of real-life video showing the humdrum of a  few young women's day-to-day life. The video is done in the  documentary way, with thick particles and slightly blurred focus. The names of all the production staff appears continuously throughout the CM, with one name lasting only for 0.1s (my guess) and you can't even read the names at all. At the beginning it asks "So, it'd be good if everybody die..." and at the end it asks "Then, why are you here?"'

> Anno: "Ai to Gensou no Fascism." [Murakami's _The Fascism of Love and Fantasy_ or _The Fascism of Love and Illusion_] I like "Zero" [from that novel]. He is a highly dependent personality. I think Ryuu Murakami and I are the same [as Zero]: empty people. Really pathetic people.
>
> Takekuma: His writing style is very stylish. [His books are] the type you keep reading because of the style.
>
> Anno: In the end, there's nothing else. It's pathetic people trying to maintain themselves, living dependently on women.
>
> Takekuma: So, the character Zero is Murakami's own self-projection.
>
> Anno: He remains unable to reject Zero. That also reveals a pathetic quality; the man himself aims at the opposite, but in the end part of his true feelings come out through Zero. It's an amazingly good novel. I think Murakami is also an "oral stage" dependent type. He is overly fixated on the mother, and overly fixated on women. He is also fixated on the idea of crying into a woman's chest. Finally, he is always thinking of doing away with his father. I think it's a story of the Oedipus Complex.
>
> Takekuma: In the desire to destroy the system, the original desire is there, right?
>
> Anno: Yes. It's a story of the Oedipus Complex, where one kills one's father and violates one's mother. However, when I started [Eva], I thought I was the same. Because it [was?] a story where Shinji kills his father and steals his mother from him.
>
> Takekuma: A mother who has become a giant (laughs).
>
> Anno: There was this replacement by a robot, so the original mother is the robot, but then there is a mother of the same age, Rei Ayanami, by [Shinji's] side. [She is] also by the side of the real father. There is also another father there, Adam, who governs the overall course of events. An Oedipus Complex within these multiple structures; that's what I wanted to do. "Ai to Gensou no Fascism." I think there are ideological elements that are the same as those in the novel. [...] The thing that most moved me was [the fact that] when the protagonist, Touji Suzuhara, attempted to kill the current Prime Minister, he felt [the Prime Minister] was a lot like his father. I think he kills his father and violates the mother "Japan." That's why he goes on to destroy Japan. I really like that passage. I like that Ryuu Murakami's real feelings are coming out. In a big way. The novel itself is extremely boring, however (laughs).

> The cult anime named Evangelion. A forbidden anime about how a group led by morally/spiritually bankrupt individuals uses an autistic boy to wage pitched battles against incomprehensible creatures, and how through contact with the hearts of a mentally fragile, bandaged girl and an overly self-conscious, traumatized girl, that boy ultimately attains deliverance/salvation himself in the final episode. Some viewers became enraged, some despondent, some lost friends as a result of hysterical disputes, and some attained deliverance/salvation themselves.
>
> ... If memory serves correctly, when the plan arose they made up to Ep6 (despite Anno apparently saying in Quick Japan magazine that they had "made up to Ep7 in advance") and sent out feelers in all directions, but were given the cold shoulder by every company. (laugh) Even Bandai snubbed them based on the past results of the huge failure of "Wings of Honneamise (Royal Space Force)". (laugh) They had connections with a TV Tokyo producer, but if you can't get sponsors it doesn't matter. So after wandering lost by the wayside for a bit, Kadokawa Shoten finally picked them up. But the truth is that even Kadokawa just barely picked them up, and flatly rejected their budget requests, saying that they only intended to budget the same level and not a yen more than other anime Kadokawa had sponsored in the past (Tenchi Muyo, etc.).
>
> ... Anno himself also replied in an interview that, "We completely ran out of time partway through...." However, the direct cause was not the PTA or a lack of time, but the more pressing issue of "budget".
>
> ... ...finally moving his heavy arse, Anno vastly restructured the production system. First, 75% or more of the production staff from Ep16 onward were outsourced South Korean staff. In terms of the animation as well, when reusing sequences other than bank sequences or for still shots, instead of using the film, these sequences were instead dubbed in at the end using a video deck. This is why character close-ups and other shots that seemed to jiggle increased partway through the series. They even mixed stupid photographs and other stuff into the mental image scenes. In the worst cases some scenes just showed a still screen that lasted for a minute or more. But no matter how much they struggled, they had already exceeded their budget and time limits. And then to top it all off were those last two episodes.
>
> Although budget issues were the main problem, Gainax had also quarreled constantly with TV Tokyo since before the TV airing over moral issues such as how the show would end and other details. These ranged from trivial points such as it being improper to show women's underwear in the hanging laundry, to major items such as the brutal scene at the end of Ep18 "The Choice of Life". It's kind of letting the cat out of the bag now, but the truth is that "Asuka dies from madness (she lives in the TV version)," "Shinji dissolves but reforms," and "Rei also dies" were already determined before the TV airing started, and Gainax had quarreled a number of times with the TV Tokyo producer and related parties over these plot devices. Furthermore, the ending was supposed to have been "The main characters die one after another, and the final battle is Ikari Shinji vs. Ikari Gendo," although there probably isn't any evidence left to support that now. (laugh) Well, except it seems that Hayashibara Megumi (voice actress for Ayanami Rei) said on a radio program something like: "I might end up fighting against Shinji." I also heard talk that "Misato and Ritsuko both die fighting each other, and Misato's death awakens Shinji(?)" Surprisingly, it seems the character who was the key to the climax was not Rei, but Misato. But then I guess it doesn't matter what is said now. (laugh)
>
> ... When Ep20 aired, complaints poured in from the PTA. This infuriated TV Tokyo all the way up to the upper management, which made it impossible for Gainax to take any bold measures. Nowadays it's pretty much taken for granted that the only people who complain over every little thing in children's TV anime or manga are people like Kofuku-no-Kagaku* pulling a publicity stunt for their "evil book banning movement".... Still, at that point the TV Tokyo upper management issued the severe notice that "Any anime that is deluged with complaints from the PTA even once from now on will be canceled regardless of the reason." The anime "Bakuretsu Hunters" and "Fushigi Yugi" were airing on the same channel at the time, and these also caught flak and received strict warnings even though they had not done anything. (laugh) That's why there were so many unnatural changes in the story contents from Ep20 onward.
>
> So for these reasons, the Eva [TV] ending was made under conditions with Gainax's hands tied in terms of budget, time and content. Considering that the last two episodes were made under those conditions, Director Anno might even be viewed as amazing.... Nope, I just can't view him like that. (laugh) After all it was his own damn fault that things turned out that way.
>
> ... Anno said in some anime magazine that "Katsuragi Misato is modeled in part on my first love," but do you know who he was talking about? It's Hidaka Noriko, the voice actress for Jean in "Nadia and the Secret of Blue Water". (laugh) When the TV version of "Nadia" launched, Anno confessed his feelings to Hidaka Noriko. This is a famous story in the industry. Apparently Anno told her that he "looked at her not as an object of adoration/longing, but as a serious love interest!" (ROTFL!) Apparently he was even seriously thinking of marriage.However, Hidaka Noriko refused him flatly, saying "I have no intention of marrying someone in the anime industry." Wait, what? Don't we know now that she was married to some anime-related producer at the time? (ROTFL!) But Anno would not give up, and told her, "Well, watch my next work, and then decide!" In other words Anno was proposing an affair to the already married Hidaka Noriko. (laugh) Anyway, Anno next work was "Evangelion", so... Evangelion might be considered a work that embodies something of a stalker obsession.
>
> ... But it looks like there is no shortage of people willing to get paid and become famous for writing magazine articles on the subject. Isn't that right? Okada-san? Takekuma-san? Otsuki Kenji-san? (ROTFL!)

> Anno, as late as the November '96 issue of Newtype magazine, still denied that the last two episodes were a "lousy job" and argued that the Gainax crew worked incredibly hard to finish the series, which he thinks "ended beautifully." He regretted that fans cannot appreciate Gainax's efforts.
>
> Asked about the violence and uncharacteristic sex scene in episodes 18 and 19, Anno said that the scenes were necessary to develop the story and "to understand real life." He felt that children should be exposed early to the realities of life so that they do not grow up weak and sheltered and so that they will become immune to some of the harsh situations they will eventually experience. Many fans at the convention thought that this was an interesting viewpoint on his part.
>
> Do you wonder why Eva got so dark and psychological near the end? After all, Anno is the guy who directed Nadia of the Mysterious Seas, one of the liveliest and funniest anime I've ever watched. According to Anno, from episode 16 on, he began reading books about human psychology and became very interested. He wanted to explore "what the human mind is all about inside."
>
> "I wrote about myself. My friend lent me a book on psychological illness and this gave me a shock, as if I finally found what I needed to say," he says in the November Newtype.

> Much of the premise and many of the early elements of EVA are familiar, indeed stereotyped elements of Japanese TV science fiction: teenage boy is chosen to pilot a robot his father built and fight against the enemy. It's reminiscent of anime from GIGANTOR to GIANT ROBO ( on which Anno was special - effects director ) , and the weird organic forms of the enemy, who attack one at a time, are reminiscent of the " monster of the week " tokusatsu shows such as ULTRAMAN ( Anno's favorite television show ) . The director of EVANGELION began from an immediately familiar and recognizable template, but in an interview before the show first aired, put the question up front: " If a person likes robot or cute girl animation, can they still be happy with it after the age of twenty? " It may seem like an odd question for Anno, 36 year - old super - otaku, who created in EVA an anime full of robots and cute girls, to pose.
>
> But the director was quite serious: his studio, Gainax is known as the otaku who examine themselves. The personal, allegorical nature of their work was treated seriously in HONNEAMISE and humorously in OTAKU NO VIDEO, and it emerges throughout the length of EVANGELION, many of whose multi - generational cast of characters are painted masks for the show's staff and most especially for Hideaki Anno himself.
>
> ... but Gainax's continuing challenge to the industry is in some ways more intriguing, as it attempts to effect a revolution from deep inside-its otaku building their intricate fantasy castles in a super - detailed style of obsessive detail, then dismantling them brick by brick to show their sense of an underlying and inescapable reality.

The only known footage of him is _Hideaki Anno Talks to Kids_, and the video doesn't show very much: he sits normally, and is standing normally, and his bow doesn't seem odd - but those are undemanding actions which wouldn't be odd with a good prosthetic.)

> [Anno] The reason the game business prospered and grew so fast is because it was a venture.  But games have finally tanked too.  It happened pretty fast, didn't it?  Our generation is naturally a shallow one, and there's no-one who's trying to overturn things.  There isn't anyone trying to make "me-anime" now, is there?
>
> ...[Anno] The first time I saw "Virtua Fighter"[2], I thought, is _this_ what anime is up against?  It was quite a shock.  That's when I realized I'd have to level up somewhere other than the visuals, I guess right before I did "EVA". Visual impact is anime's strong point, but since games had followed on anime's heels, it had become a time when a methodology no different from the others just wouldn't cut it.  All the cards had already been dealt, so we had no choice but to change the combination, or turn over cards that were thought to be taboo. That's what I mean when I say that "EVA" didn't use even a single new methodology.
>
> [Ikuhara] Ah, like what the media talks about as creatorhood when discussing animated works.  But that's just an illusion, and actually in the anime business no such thing as a creator is anywhere to be found.  All there are are people who were brought along by the founding of the system.  The people who devise the form of the anime of today.
>
> ...[Ikuhara] There's somewhere where we'll give up, isn't there.  We're trying to fulfill our own ambitions virtually.  I suppose if we were doing it for real we should be trying to make more properly ideal cities and better human relations. I can't really say it in anything but pedestrian terms, but, like with things like the Aum[*1] incident, I can understand the feelings of the people who want to reorganize the world. [Anno] In order to see a made-up drama, there are even people who neglect their real lives, right?  That kind of person does things like become a seiyuu fan.
>
> [Ikuhara] I bet what they really wanted was to touch an anime character.
>
> [Anno] For something that could connect the virtual and the real, I too turned to the seiyuu.  But that was a mistake.  That's why I tried to show something different in "KareKano".  But altering the existing system is tough.
>
> ...[Anno] Yes, a world where something is done with the body alone.  Nothing else befits a documentary.  A world that shows nothing of creation.
>
> [Ikuhara] Take "Utena" and "EVA".  They take a fragment of our work and talk about us introducing impact into our animation, saying it's like Terayama Shushi[12]'s work or something.  It's nothing that narrow, is it?  I think that what appears in our works is the complex about the body that people who make made-up anime feel.
>
> [Anno] I use the word "lifelike-ness".  Compared to that, cel anime is pretty and virtual.  Because I feel a sense of thwarted life in current cel anime, I want to try to peek at it from a slightly different direction.  Like trying not to use any of the established seiyuu.

Horn's affirmation that Peter Svensson really did ask at '98 Fanime of Yamaga whether Anno was sane: <http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2006-August/003688.html>

> "The May 1998 issue would have been called "Book Two, Issue #3" on its cover (that is, it contained the third chapter from vol. 2, Stage 9). It contained a special feature transcribing some of Hiroyuki Yamaga's answers to audience questions at Fanime Con '98 after a screening of Evangelion: Death (True) and Evangelion (Rebirth). I believe Mr. Yamaga's panel was also covered in Protoculture Addicts, but they may have included some remarks and not others (and the reverse is likely true for my piece)."

    --[George Chen](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-July/017258.html), describing the notes accompanying the Japanese release of Genesis 0:12 and describing the changes & additions made as part of the Director's Cut

> Anno: Before that I read Mr. Matsumoto's Battlefield manga series, and I also liked Wadachi. I was hanging out in my neighborhood browsing through an issue of Adventure King when I saw the announcement for the first episode: "New series, Space Battleship Yamato." The title caught my fascination immediately. In our house we had one TV and the rest of my family wanted to watch Heidi, but I wanted Yamato. That was how it first pulled me in and got me devoted. These days we call it a 'hammer.' I think that was the first work to give me such an experience.
>
> Matsumoto: Well, one of the few people who was in our audience! Our ratings were close to zero.
>
> Anno: I went out and prosyletized for it. I told all my schoolmates, "watch Yamato!" They could always catch Heidi in reruns. Or maybe not. (Laughter)
>
> ...Anno: If not for that, I don't think I'd be doing my job now. That's for sure. I recorded episodes on cassette then, because there were no VCRs, so I think Miyagawa-sensei's music was the only kind I listened to. (Laughter)
>
> Yamato was an epic. It made us feel like we were seeing adult anime for the first time. It wasn't directed at children. The music was very adult, too. Of course, it had a huge visual impact, but since I was in the generation that listened to Yamato on tape, it's what gave me an ear for music. By the virtue of those two things, that's why I'm here now.
>
> Matsumoto: An eighth-grader, about 14 years old. That was the first age where you could really get into it. That's how it was with my generation, too, but we drifted away when it didn't suit us anymore. Yours is the generation that was assimilated into the screen.
>
> Anno: The influence of Captain Okita was very big. Goro Naya's voice telling us to overcome our fears and believe in tomorrow. I said, "Yes! That's it!" (Laughter)
>
> My view of life and the way I think about things was surely influenced by that.
>
> ...[Leiji Matsumoto]: Anyway, it [_Space Battleship Yamato_] was my first animation job. It was pretty hard. Honestly, I wasn't concerned about the ratings. I brought it up, but I don't mind it particularly.
>
> Anno: It had a lot of energy. The work of [Animation Director] Noboru Ishiguro was very good.
>
> Matsumoto: We're the same age. We were about 36 then. The main staff was generally about that age. That was the generation that wouldn't go down without a fight. We'd have shouting matches or turn a deaf ear and kick up a big fuss about things and stay up all night.
>
> Anno: Ishiguro once asked me if I was over 30. I said I was already 32, and he said "you've got three more years. You'll do the best work of your life at 35." That's about how old he was when he made Yamato, so it's true.
>
> I was 35 when I made Evangelion, so I guess that's my best work. 35 or 36 may be the right age.
>
> ...Matsumoto: It's a very powerful thing, a dream inspired by the feminine. It gives men a lust for life. To perservere through many hardships for the sake of a matchless beauty.
>
> Anno: Like hearing the voice of Starsha and flying all the way to Iscandar? I'd go for her, but if it was some scruffy guy instead, I wouldn't answer the call no matter how urgent. I wouldn't believe him! (Laughter)
>
> Matsumoto: Neither would I!
>
> Anno: If there isn't an incredibly beautiful woman at the end of the journey, there's no use. I'd want to go just to meet the woman.

> Tell us about your feelings vis-a-vis your character.
>
> As far as I'm concerned, Shinji is all grown up, as of the end of the movie. Everyone has their own feelings on the subject, starting with the director, but to me, he's finished wandering from child to adult. Thus I was pretty stuck when it came to doing this game. You see, this is still Shinji at that time in his life when he's lost, and it was pretty tough for me to recall that period. That may well have caused me to blank out at times, which might be just like Shinji, in some perverse way (laughs).
> To me personally, Shinji grew up, very naturally...and wouldn't want to go back to the way things were. I may well have made him a different character from the way he was before, in fact. I'm sorry (laughs).
>
> ... --What was it like squaring off with other characters?
>
> I only played off Hidaka Noriko, and the shows she worked on (Top and Nadia) had pretty different worldviews from Eva, which left me kind of stuck. Shinji was a very real sort of character, in that he didn't act like an anime character, but typically talked very quietly and sparingly, and it was like he was suddenly thrust into an anime world (laughs). Here I was, talking with Shinji's gloomy voice, and right next to me is Hidaka Noriko, with her positive, impassioned manner of speech. I thought that this must be what your average anime hero is really like (laughs). The gap in tension levels between these characters was so great that I'm worried that it might have put a crimp in her performance too.
>
> ...If you use Shinji, you're likely to lose, so I recommend against it (laughs)."

How about the complementation of Shinji's heart? Here the path of Shinji's complementation is described. This is just one form [katachi: shape, form; I am tempted to translate it as scenario, but I think I'd better preserve the original word as much as possible. The Japanese here "Kore wa mata hitotsu no katachi de atta" has the connotation that there are other "forms", which I interpret as other possibilities, or other endings.].
>
> At the very end of the episode, when Shinji is smiling and all that. The comment said, "Shinji's blissful smile. This is the smile of complemented Shinji. This is just one form, one of the many possibilities."

> Here, I've found what I had lost--Anno said this with a heartfelt voice.
>
> How could Toyoko Academy have nothing but nice people like this? No bullying, no violence, no failures to communicate...the editorial staff were themselves profoundly moved to find that a school such as this exists in a society full of ugliness, hate, and despair. Is it really like this, though? We asked the students to tell us more.
>
> ... Kashiwara: Even within a given class, we respect one another. It makes me feel good to have such good friends. We pat one another on the back when we do something good, and cry together when something sad happens.
>
> Anno: Here, I have found what I had lost. I guess I've just gotten hard and crusty. But my heart is bursting at the thought that people like you still exist.

  --<http://web.archive.org/web/20050211083730/www.gainax.co.jp/special/kiiteyo/toyoko02-e.html>

> Anno: There's really nothing I can say here. I mean, I've been aware of the existence of high-school students like you, intellectually. Right now, I'm working on an anime series based on a girls' manga, but the world of girls' comics, where everyone is nice, looks completely unreal to me. It's a major surprise to find that there are people in the world who praise others so unreservedly. I guess such people really do exist after all.
>
> Kashiwara: Do unpleasant things really exist?
>
> Anno: There's no need to go out of your way to find them.

> Kasagi: I think that's one of your good points, though, Aya (Kashiwara). You're confident in yourself, so you can't let anyone see even a little bit of breakdown. You practice in secret, out of pride.
>
> Anno: You should start by throwing away your public image.
>
> All: "Public image?"
>
> Anno: Yes, the image you decide on, where you are this or that character type.
>
> Kashiwara: There are times, though, when you think that you can't cry because you are who you are. You do have your particular character. I get the feeling that that's how the teachers really see the students. There are harsh things which they would say to me because I can handle it, but that they wouldn't say to a student who's more easily hurt by such things. I've never cried, even when I'm hurting, because I practice hard at home. I've made modifications to my home. I installed a barre and other stuff, and did it all myself.

> Murayama: I'd like to work with film and video. I was really impressed by Evangelion, and it's gotten me interested in anime and stuff like that lately.
>
> Anno: I apologize for getting you all worked up. You'd best stay away from it.
>
> ... Murayama: It looks incredible from where I'm sitting.
>
> Anno: I can't really be all that proud of my own work.
>
> Murayama: Is that so? I think it's terrific.
>
> Anno: It doesn't matter whether one does this kind of work or not, so you're better off not doing it.
>
> Murayama: I think it's great to be doing what you want.
>
> Anno: You've got it all wrong. This is the only thing I can do. Getting married, having kids, and raising them to be adults--that's far and away more of an accomplishment than making a movie. And the biggest accomplishment of all is to do all of that and make anime at the same time. In my case, I've managed to get this far because I gave up everything else. I don't see any need for anyone else to sacrifice everything else in life for this, though.
>
> ... Anno: But if you like it, who cares? You need to like this sort of thing a certain amount to be able to do it. And once you've given it up, you'll be OK.
>
> Takahashi: Once you've given it up?
>
> Anno: Right. The instant you wake up to reality again. When you realize that enjoyment alone won't see you through.
>
> Shibasaki: You mean, you give it up, but even then, you still keep doing it?
>
> Anno: Well, that's where you find out what you're really made of. To some extent, anyone can each a certain level of achievement if they try. Whether they can go beyond that point depends on the given individual. Going beyond that point requires quality. Hard work alone won't do it. And there will always be someone better than you. If you get carried away by how good you are, what do you suppose will happen when you discover that there are far better people in the world already?
>
> ... Anno: Exactly. I put my work ahead of everything, which makes me cold. I sacrifice people, including myself. Going that far is like being prepared to die.

> Takahashi: But don't your parents tell you things like, "That's why Japan is going into the toilet"? When I say that I think things are OK, my folks reply with, "That's what's wrong with the Japanese way of thinking."
>
> Mutoo: I hate America.
>
> Anno: (laughs)
>
> Mutoo: I've learned to hate it.
>
> Takahashi: I bet people who debate international relations all hate America.
>
> Mutoo: Is all they do in America to criticize others without looking at themselves? Don't they act like they're the greatest? Always saying they're the world's best.
>
> Hirata: I don't like America either. Right now, Japan's economy is bad. But when it was really good, America said that it was doing too well, and now that it's bad, they won't help us out. They just say that it's our own fault. Makes me think, who do they think they are, anyway?
>
> All: (laughter)
>
> ... Anno: Asia is where it's at now. We'd best get in good with our neighbors. The previous generation is with America. Those currently in their 50's typically think in terms of America. In reaction to losing the War to America, they all want to live the American lifestyle. Like all going to Europe, that sort of thing.
>
> Takahashi: I get that feeling when I read theses written by people of that time.
>
> Anno: It's like an America-first philosophy. In my generation, though, you turn more and more to domestic matters, look more inward. When I was in the boondocks of Yamaguchi, Tokyo as I saw it on TV looked so incredible, so I always wanted to go there. I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend college, that sort of thing.

> Anno: Put it on TV, though, and old ladies with time on their hands watch it. We got one such old lady calling the TV station while "Evangelion" was on the air, saying that we shouldn't have sexy scenes.
>
> Miyabu: Just for that?
>
> Anno: Yep. There's no sense of realism about high school students having a romance without sex, is there. I'm thinking about putting a message at the beginning of each episode telling grade-school students not to watch.
>
> Miyabu: Are the main characters of "Kareshi Kanojo no Jijoo" going to be junior-high or high school students?
>
> Anno: They're in their first year of high school, and in the manga they've recently had sex. And it just happened, without any buildup. I'm trying to figure out how to make something dramatic out of this. Could that be the way it is? Do they just do it?
>
> Miyabu: What do you think?
>
> Anno: I think I'm stuck. The male lead seemed to me to be so terribly upstanding, I figured he'd treat her better than that, when he up and has sex with her. He's not the character I thought he was. Maybe that's what it's like nowadays. People don't waste time, or something.
>
> ... Anno: Everyone defines pure love differently. But old biddies like the one who complained (about Eva) have never experienced it. They do things like that to kill time, because they're dissatisfied with kids today. They're not dissatisfied with themselves, but with their environment, their surroundings. They ignore any blame they may have for their situations, instead blaming everything on anime. I never thought I'd get caught up in it. Nobody sounds as loud as old biddies like those. They have so much time on their hands that instead of calling telephone dating clubs, they call TV stations.

>
> Anno: I didn't have any girlfriends in high school. I did manga and astronomy, as well as watch anime and play mah jongg. When there was a test, I'd tell my folks I was going to a friend's house to study. We'd play all-night mah jongg, then we'd catch a nap before eventually going to school, and when the test was over we'd go back and play mah jongg some more. It was all anime and mah jongg. Back then, girls avoided me like the plague, because I was so gloomy.
>
> ... Anno: In junior high, I had a little fling that seemed like love, but wasn't. It turned into a triangle with a pal of mine, and that turned into a crisis. All through high school, I decided that being the way I was, was fine, and had no romances the whole time. Some underclasswomen came on to me, but I showed them no interest. The world was full of things more interesting than women. I was much more interested in making movies back then than dating. I regret it now, though. My life might be different now if I'd had sex back then.
>
> ... Anno: I don't recommend technical schools. Everyone who goes to one of those places starts off by having the same field of specialty, after all, so monotony soon sets in. Take anime schools for example. You go to one of those, and you've got a gathering of people who've all been social and class outcasts up to now. You'll start suffering the illusion that the world revolves around you as a result. I haven't yet seen anyone who liked anime and who'd ever gotten any use out of what he learned in those places.

> Anno: I hate school, you know? And the thing I hate about it is no different from 20 years ago. Teachers also ought to have hated school, seeing as how they were about the same age as me. So they should have hated it too, you know? Why did becoming teachers change them into teachers?
>
> All: Sad but true.
>
> Anno: And it's scary to think that they had to have been students too. The world changes people. Parents too: they had to have been kids themselves once, and yet as parents they're so different.
>
> ... Noguchi: When it comes to law, you've got privacy safeguards, for example, but there are also things that need to be made public, and in cases where a choice has to be made, it ends up in a courtroom, with the decision being left up to the judge to make.
>
> Anno: Laws in the light of a trial are unreasonable things. School is acclimatizing you to that, so you won't complain about it.
>
> Ichikawa: We're being trained, like pets.

> Anno: I was basically the honor-student type up until junior high. I was always on student council, that sort of thing. I got into the best feeder schools in my area, up to high school. I swore that I wouldn't do any more studying once I passed my exams. I didn't like to study, so I studied only the areas and sentences that interested me, and that as little as possible. What good is algebra going to do me in real life, after all?
>
> ... Anno: When I got a zero, the school not annoyed because they were supposed to be a feeder school. So I made sure not to get negative marks. When I got to high school, all I did was play mah jongg and make 8mm movies. I spent all my high school years just goofing off. So naturally there were no universities I could get into, and at the time, Osaka College of Art had no entrance exams. Rather, I got in on my accomplishments. But I stopped going in my third year, and ended up getting expelled.
>
> ... Anno: What it boils down to is, society only sees the numbers. When it comes to movies too, there's a need to apply either of two labels, either that it was interesting or that it wasn't. School grades are the same way, because Japan only has one evaluation method, that of negative test scoring. I think cumulative test scoring would be more interesting, personally. In the final analysis, the system is about how can you avoid making mistakes. The top score is set at 100 points. It's a game, and the object is to figure out how to minimize your mistakes and keep teachers from reducing your points. I'd say that the problem lies with this negative scoring system, but if asked, I'd also have to say that cumulative scoring wouldn't solve things either.
>
> ... Anno: I think it's clear that they're a far cry from when I was in high school. They're smart. I get the feeling that they can see their own lives in an instant, by observing their parents and other grown-ups around them. And I'm enjoying that.
>
> Kawakami: I heard something to the effect that as part of making anime, you meet and talk with lots of different people.
>
> Anno: I think that's more or less what I said. Anime and manga are completely fictional picture worlds, and thus what happens in them is impossible in real life. Now, there are two approaches you can take. You can either make it look like a dream all the way to the end, where you bring it back to reality, or you can show reality all the way to the end, and finish up with a dream. A lot of anime starts out as a dream, and ends as a dream. This is no good, because it feels like you're using dreams as a retreat. And Japan is not such a tough place to live.
>
> I can't help but wonder why people are withdrawing into dreams in a reasonably prosperous country. A lot of these people in particular are anime fans, and for a while I couldn't deal with that. I got fed up with Evangelion too, for that reason. I can't stand people who run away, who refuse to face reality. Surely you'll find something for yourself if you face reality head on. If nothing else, take a good look at your immediate surroundings. Don't turn away from unpleasantness. Have a look at it too. With this in mind, ultimately I want to show a little reality in my works. If nothing else, I don't feel any realism in something that has no reality mixed in with it. Thus, while my next production will be a girl's manga about a high-school girl, it's also partly real.

> Ikeda: You may get really tired, but if you're not aware of it, it's the same as not being tired at all, isn't it? Even if I should realize it and keel over from exhaustion, that's fine, because my life right now is good. It's great. Right now, I figure I'll keep on going the rest of my life, in just this way.

>
> Anno: Yeah, I think it's better to believe that tomorrow is always with us, rather than that it can be cleanly cut away. That doesn't mean that you do the same thing tomorrow as today, though. It's important to form an image of tomorrow being even just a little different, say, even as little 3% or 5%, from today. If you believe that you want to be a certain way, chances are you'll move in that direction. Having a clear image is the key.

## 1998 S

> '"Everyone in _Evangelion_ is "seriously messed up," Anno's translator at 1996's Anime Expo offered. Having gambled and won on _Evangelion_, Anno can afford to dismiss his critics. But this ultimate "fanboy", who breaks into "Ultraman" poses when in front of the camera, is as hard on himself as he is on his industry and its fans. _Evangelion_ was a struggle against four years of his own cowardice - a hiatus from work where "all I was doing was simply not dying", said Anno to his American audience. "If I talk about the 'limitations' of the industry, after all, what does that mean? Aren't I really talking about the limitations inside myself? It is the creators who have to change their frame of mind." Most people who make anime, Anno said, have the kind of "autism" he himself has suffered from. "They have to try and reach out with their work, and communicate to others. What's the greatest thing anime has ever achieved? The fact that we're holding a dialogue right here and now." When a fan of the master asked for advice to those who'd like to break into anime, he shot back, "Be interested in other things *besides* animation."'

> Azuma Hiroki:  I think that this phenomenon is very new in Japanese cultural scene of the 80's: the multiplication in number does not mean that they socialize and get open. Anno is very conscious about such closeness. In other interviews [mit einschlaegigen Animemagazinen [_Animage_]] he says that in the beginning of making _Evangelion_ he wanted to enlarge the number of otaku. It was some kind of master plan for  "otakuzation" in order to break the closedness. But towards the end [of the production process] he had to break that pattern and to diffuse it. This change, that occurred in less than half a year is very important to Japanese culture, because it clearly shows that one typical strategy to implode a closed/specialized cultural terrain necessarily results in failure. The series _Evangelion_ can be divided in 2 parts. The first part is a well made Sci-Fi anime. The characters are described as happy and communicative; typical Sci-Fi anime characters such as Asuka. Rei is of course very exceptional. The first part seems to develop into a happy ending, which is of course the most desirable plot for anime fans. The way they watch these films is a process of identifying with the characters. They want to be Shinji or Asuka. But the later part diverges from such a typical pattern. The reviews and comments of Anime fans published in their respective magazines show their disappointment with the later episodes, since there is no hope for a happy ending and no space for their identification with characters. The mystery of the _Evangelion_ world gets increasingly critical and complicated. This is obviously not a typical Anime plot anymore. Another level is the level of imagery. The speed of cut ups is very high towards the end. When I asked Anno about influences he did not mention Nouvelle Vague, although I expected him to say Godard. He named Okamoto Kihachi, a filmmaker of the Japanese Nouvelle Vague, who was actually influenced by Godard. [_Blue Christmas_ was by Kihachi.]
>
>...[AH:] In episode 19 Evangelion punches the enemy, the black  Evangelion. This scene is very violent and brutal. Such cruel imagery cannot be accepted by Anime fans.
>
> KW: Was there a controversy about this particular scene?
>
> AH: Anno didn't speak  about this issue clearly. He just said that somebody made a claim. TV producers, advertisers, ... I don't know. It seems a delicate matter.

    This is a drama, and thus fiction.
    It is anime, which means it is all told in drawings.
    The production schedule is also impacted.
    But it is my hope to fill this work to the brim with the sense that this is what we feel.
    I hope that this work will touch your hearts and souls.
    I hope that it will reach you beyond just a sense of cuteness.
    None of us will ever truly understand anyone else.
    The bigger our hopes, the greater our failures.
    Reality has no mercy.
    But if there is a tomorrow, we will think again on those who matter to us.
    That means you as well as me.
    In hopes that we may all meet and fall in love with someone wonderful.

Gainax tradition indeed...

> Changing the subject, there's a window in direct line with the second-floor hallway of the GAINAX Building, with a chair right next to that window. It's for those who want to take a breather, look outside, and have a smoke. When I passed by there this afternoon, though, there was someone just sitting on the cold floor of the hallway, smoking a cigarette. It was Hirose, who's doing cel running for episode 8.

When I peeked in the production room about five minutes later, however, he was sleeping the sleep of the just. So much for that.

(In a similar vein, [Carl Horn](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=370539#370539) says that "Yamaga once asked an American fan who wanted to work at Gainax if she had ever seen the movie _[Das Boot](!Wikipedia)_, because he said that did a good job suggesting the work space".)

> "Their best original works--Yamaga's _Royal Space Force_, Takeshi Mori's _Otaku no Video_, Kazuya Tsurumaki's _FLCL_, and Anno's _Evangelion_--display Gainax's odd inside-out paradox of being super-obsessed fans who, through their meditations, nevertheless sometimes come to enlightenment about the nature of themselves, their medium, their industry, their times, and their world."

> Although Death and Rebirth  has not yet had a commercial release on video or disc in Japan, it recently aired on the Japanese cable channel WOWOW, and this copy was the source for the public screening at Fanime -- a screening believed to be the first in the United States.
>
> Death and Rebirth came out in Japan on March 15, 1997. A month prior to the film's Japanese premiere, Eva director Hideaki Anno called a Valentine's Day press conference to announce that while "it was my intent to conclude (Eva) with (Death and Rebirth)... the story expanded far beyond the vision I had when we began production, and we went vastly over the planned running length and frames of animation."
>
> ...  Death is an edited version of the events of episodes #1-24 of the Evangelion TV series, yet it is no mere synopsis; besides containing several new scenes (it opens with secret UN footage from their Antarctic Base shortly before the Second Impact), Death tells the story of Eva in a completely different order that leads the viewer to contemplate director Anno's choice of view and focus. Hiroyuki Yamaga compared Anno's editing method to that of a DJ, "sampling" the episodes in a complex, non-linear mix. In another, literal sense as well, Death is a musical composition -- the movie is structured as a string concerto in four parts, and we return at various points in the edit to the same mysterious locale where much of the events of Eva TV episodes #25 and #26 take place (thus strongly suggesting that despite the presentation of The End of Evangelion -- of which Rebirth is of course the first part -- as a "remake" of those final two episodes, it might be better regarded as another viewpoint on them instead) where various Eva characters perform, separately and together, musical selections from Bach, Beethoven, and Pachelbel.

> 'I was flipping through the old Japanese classics "Genji Monogatari" (Tale of Genji) the other day. It's been quite some time since I looked at the final part of this monumental work, and I found that the name of the hero in this part of the story is "Kaworu"!!
>
> I did some more research on this name. These are the facts about "Kaworu" that I find out:
>
> - The reason why "Kaworu" is written with a "wo" character is probably influenced by classics work like "Genji Monogatari". In the Heian ages and medieval period, "wo" and "o" were quite separate words. At that time "Kaworu" was indeed written with "wo" character. The two characters merged in their pronunciation in the Edo period and thus created the confusion as to why "Kaworu" should have a "wo" character. It is possible that some Japanese may not even know this, and it has become common practice to write "Kaoru". This creates more confusion.
> - "Kaworu" is a serious but also romantic hero in the last third of the Tale of Genji. And literally the kanji for "Kaworu" means fragrance (of incense wood). Indeed in Tale of Genji, Kaworu was born with a very special bodily feature: His body bore a sweet fragrance smell. So the name "Kaworu" is commonly related to the idea of intelligent, handsome and romantic hero.
> - And one more striking thing. "Kaworu" can be a girl's name as well!!This adds to the ambiguity of sex implicated by this name. Put it into the context that Kaworu is an epitome of shoujo-anime bishonen (handsome boy) with ambiguous sexuality. Now it seems to me that Gainax actually put some thought in choosing his name.
> - Lastly, it can now become clear that despite "Kaworu"'s Caucasian look, he indeed has a Japanese name.'

    --[Patrick Yip](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-March/011357.html) (Interestingly, in Anno's [2000 character name essay](#p-8), he has no idea what the first name signifies.)

> Well the PTA managed to stop Go Nagai's Shameful School (Harenchi Gakuen) from being published.  U-Jin's Angel was pulled from publication a few years ago after loud PTA objections, but then it came back in a new 3-D stereogram edition essentially uncut.  If EVA was a late night anime, the PTA probably wouldn't have raised a ruckus, if it ever did.  But since EVA was shown on primetime, when children (as well as adults) would likely be able to watch, concerned parents _might_ have objected to it.  From what I've gathered, EVA had more "mature situations" than any anime on primetime television.  It also had religious themes (or tose that could be _interpreted_ as such) that are virtually nonexistant in the medium.

> 'When the very first meeting was held before the title had even been decided, Anno had already provided the theme of "a battle between gods and humans".  Both Anno and I -- our generation -- was influenced by Go Nagai, so making something on a grand scale meant it ended up like "Devilman". The character design request from Anno was that "the lead character is a girl, and has an older-sister type figure like Coach next to her," so it was structurally similar to "Gunbuster". So I first designed an Asuka-type girl as the lead character, but after "Gunbuster" and "Nadia" I felt some resistance to making the lead character a girl again. I mean a robot should be piloted by a trained person, and if that person just happens to be a girl then that is fine, but I couldn't see why a young girl would pilot a robot... So I remember saying to Anno, "It's a robot story, so let's make the lead character a boy."  And just about that time, I was watching the NHK [public TV channel] program "Brain and Heart" and learned about the existence of the A10 nerve, and I told Anno about the idea that popped into my head at that time. That was the idea where "the dead mother is inside the robot, which is operated by mental/psychical bonding with the child. Moreover, parent-child relations are parched/strained due to the death of the mother at a young age."
>
> ...
>
> An easily recognizable silhouette is also important, but I designed the characters so that their personalities could be more or less understood at a glance.  For example, even the color and length of the hair expresses personality.  I thought that Asuka would occupy the position of an "idol" in the Eva world, and that [Asuka and] Shinji should be just like the relationship between Nadia and Jean. And then I set Rei as the opposing "Ying" portion.  It was my idea to have her wrapped in bandages.  The most difficult was Misato.  So I thought it would be interesting to have someone like the older girl next door as a military person.
>
> We had talked a lot in the beginning about wanting a title like "Space Runaway Ideon (Legendary Giant God Ideon)", so I think I did push that.  And to tell the truth, the story composition is also similar.  For example, Nerv can be considered the same as the Solo Ship fighting a lonely battle against both humankind and the Buff Clan, and then there are the incomprehensible robots that can only communicate with children and tend to go berserk, etc.  It might not be an exaggeration to say that if you add "Ideon" and "Devilman" together and divide by two, you get "Evangelion".

> [Hideaki Anno:] ...In brief, I was following the manga, and I arrived to the part of the "big battle". It was something unexpected, and for a child like me, it was shocking.
>
> Gô Nagai : And what marked you?
>
> H: For example, this scene where a character faced schoolgirl prisoners, who's clothes were torn, were hiding their breasts and the crotch, and tells them "Hands up !" It's remarkable, like a comical scene. I think it was one of my first memories of your work. But your influence on me is incalculable, impossible to evaluate. After all, even in Evangelion, I couldn't get away from the Devilman influence…
>
> G: Oh yes ? I was told that there were similarities, therefore I went to see Evangelion in the cinema with that idea, but I didn't feel that.
>
> H: No, but I think I didn't do it consciously… After that, people made me notice : "Ah this is Devilman", etc…
>
> ...[Interviewer] You both are from two different generations. What was your idea of a monster, when you were kids ?
>
> H: I wasn't a big fan of monster movies, not as much as Master Nagai… I didn't hate it, but for me war movies was rather my thing. After that, I started on hero stories like Ultraman.
>
> G: You were not watching Ultra Q, Ultraman's prequel?
>
> H: I saw it, but I couldn't get a hold of it. We were seeing only monsters, and scary stuff… We can conclude that I prefer giant heroes over monsters.
>
> G: Someone told me that Evangelion was visually inspired by Ultraman, is it true ?
>
> H: EVA is an "Ultramanian" character, sure. But to be honest, the visual inspiration also comes from Devilman.
>
> G: Really ?
>
> H: There's also some Shuten Douji in it. And also the idea that even demons and ogres with their scary faces. I think the thing we name "power" is something really scary. So when the design was to be made, I particularly insisted that he is scary-looking. If kids could start crying just by watching an episode, that would be ideal. To the point to make it an anti-hero, something which is scary. For that, Devilman was the perfect model. I had drawn a "rough" version of EVA which looked a lot like Devilman, with the curved back, la taille fine, a thick chest plate. It was the image that I made from Devilman. But EVA also has common points with Mazinger Z. Him too has a scary demonic face.
>
> G: For what is Devilman and Mazinger Z, I didn't have the intention to give them nightmare-esque faces, but that naturally came to me ! (Laughs)
>
> H: In Mao Dante, the ears of Ryo Utsugi become the eyes of a demon, right ? In the first version of EVA, when we looked at its eyes closely, we also noticed an influence from Mao Dante. Before that I did the Gunbuster ova, and for the robot design, I told myself that giving it two eyes was a bit dull. So I made it like a cyclop, but later I realized it was a mistake. Even with their shadow, robots like Mazinger remained recognisable, even if the eyes were no longer just two white shapes. In Gunbuster, with its unique eye, it didn't work well. I therefore told myself that next time, I will definitely make a robot with compound eyes, like an insect. For that, I coloured all of the body of the first version of EVA with a gloomy colour, except for the eyes, which I left in white, to attract attention.
>
> ...H: Still concerning the face, I love Mazinger Z in profile towards the first episode in the prepublication. It's his first appearance and Kouji discovers it with a stunning cry.
>
> G: The scene in the house of the grandpa, is that it ?
>
> H: Yes, it really marked me. That must be why I gave the same kind of eyes to the first version of EVA. When I brought these rectifications on the original drawings, I couldn't prevent myself from drawing the eyes in the style of Master Nagai.
>
> And in the first episode of Evangelion, the first appearance of EVA is a big shot on his face, right ?
>
> H: Euh yes, that's it. (Laugh) Sorry.
>
> G: Fancy that ? (Laugh)

### Platinum commentary

> From the planning stages, Hideaki Anno, a representative creator of GAINAX, was at the heart of the production work and his individuality colors every aspect of the show. Fascinating characters, a captivating sci-fi premise, dynamic battle scenes, and super-high density of information that incorporates Christianity and psychoanalysis. Each of those elements surpassed the realm of all anime that had come before it and made it a work worthy of the title "New Century (Neon Genesis)."
>
> From back when it was airing on TV, Neon Genesis Evangelion had the ardent support of fans and its popularity boomed even after it finished its run. Its influence was not limited to anime fans but also spread to the general populace, and it was even called the third impact, following Space Battleship Yamato and Mobile Suit Gundam.

> Reunited with Shinji for the first time in 3 years, the executive commander of NERV, Gendo Ikari, orders him to get on the Eva and out into the field on the spot. And faced with Eva Unit-00 and Rei Ayanami, he repeats over and over, "I Mustn't run away," as if he is trying to convince himself of it. "Communicating with others" is a vital theme of Evangelion and depicting how Shinji interacts with those around him is part of the story of Evangelion. The revealing of why Gendo treats Shinji so coldly is left to Episode Twenty-Six, "My True Heart For You," which was released theatrically.

> When Shinji comes to New Tokyo-3, he sees a girl that seems to be Rei Ayanami for just an instant. Considering how she is injured and wrapped up in bandages, when he later meets her in NERV Headquarters, the natural assumption would be to think that this was a phantom vision. But in Episode 26, "My True Heart For You," a different possibility is suggested. The girl that appeared for just one cut in this scene may be the Rei Ayanami who is "the existence that gazes upon man."
>
> ... Shinji was supposed to live by himself, but instead, Misato takes him in and the two begin their life together in her apartment.  In order to try to close the gap between her and him, Misato acts silly around Shinji and as if in response to that, Shinji acts exaggeratedly surprised by the presence of Pen Pen, the hot spring penguin.  Seeing Shinji's true intentions in his actions, Misato says to herself, "Maybe I'm the one who's transparent."  It is a most Eva-like depiction concerning "communication."  In the preview, the idea of her taking Shinji in is clearly stated as "Misato's arrogance."  The sense with which they coolly capture such events is also part of the appeal of Evangelion.
>
> ... Toji, who consciously behaves like a man, and Kensuke, who has his own world of his hobby concerning all things military and who also knows how to get on in the world, are very contrasting characters compared to Shinji. The names of these two characters are taken from the main characters in Ryu Murakami's The Fascism of Love and Illusions, which provides no small amount of inspiration for Director Anno.
>
> ... In this episode, Ritsuko talks about the "hedgehog's dilemma," which is a psychology term that originates from Schopenhauer's fable, and it expresses the complications and ambivalence that arises as people seek the psychological distance to maintain between each other. This is where the English episode title "Hedgehog's Dilemma" for Episode Four "Rain, Escape, and Afterwards" comes from. In addition, what Misato says in this same scene allows us to see what her thoughts on communicating are at this time, so that is also very interesting.
>
> ... Episode Four depicts the wanderings of Shinji, who has run away from Misato and NERV. Shinji and Misato hurt each other with their thorns as they try to get closer, and yet even then, they need one another. The relationship between these two is indeed just like the "hedgehog's dilemma" that Ritsuko had mentioned in Episode Three. There is no battle with an Angel and it largely stays away from addressing any of the mysteries, but when considered from a thematic perspective, this is truly Eva-like drama.
>
> In actuality, this episode was once omitted in terms of the series composition and it was planned that what is now Episode Five would come after Episode Three. But as production progressed, staff members voiced their opinion that perhaps there was a need to depict Shinji's relationship with the people around him after Episode Three, and thus, this episode was made, greatly changing the contents from what had originally been conceived. Because of this, the script for this episode written after the script for Episode Five had already been finalized. This is the one and only episode of all the TV and movie episodes in which Director Anno did not have a direct hand in the plot and script.
>
> In terms of performance, the highlight has got to be the final cut at the train station where Shinji and Misato gaze at each other. This cut, which has absolutely no dialogue or movement, lasts roughly 50 seconds. It is a silence that would normally be inconceivably long, but it depicts Shinji's feelings in finding it difficult to express himself in words.

> Among the footage shown are included a number of characters and images who appear towards the middle and end of the show as well. At the time this show aired, these served as signs of things to come and the presentation of mysteries to the viewers. How will the images of Unit-01's bloody hand and of the bloody utility poles and Unit-01's foot unfold and appear within the story? What is the giant of light that possesses a silhouette that looks like an Eva? Who are the pencil sketches of the woman and the boy with the piercing gaze? What about the mysterious letters in the final scene? Or why does the caption "ANGEL" appear after the scene of the boy's face and the scene of Rei Ayanami? All the answers to the mysteries presented in the opening are presented in the show and the movies.

  --<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol2_introduction.htm>; Yes, what *about* those mysterious letters? TV script for the OP calls them ['angelic script'](http://wiki.evageeks.org/FGC:OP_Cut_085) and they resemble but don't match the real [angelic script](http://www.steliart.com/angelology_celestial_alphabet.html). [Patrick Yip](http://lists.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-March/011349.html) writes that a number of Japanese fan books analyze the script as distorted ancient Chinese for the NERV slogan "God's in His Heaven" etc.

> The name "Operation Yashima" is a reference to when Yoichi Nasuno shoots the fan with his bow from atop his horse on the beach in the "Battle at Yashima" in the first year of Bunji (1185). That's Chief of Operations Katsuragi for you, quite the intellectual. In addition, "Yashima" written differently is also the old name for Japan. Thus, the name also contains a reference to the operation gathering electrical power from all of Japan.
>
> ... You can also enjoy the Kihachi Okamoto-esque camerawork that Director Anno excels at. The drama of communication between Shinji and Misato also hits a plateau. The segment From Episode One to this episode can be thought of as the "Prologue Arc" of the series.
>
> Misato is normally slovenly, but here, she gallantly stops the J.A. without any regard for her own life. Shinji is disappointed by the enormous difference between these two sides of her, but at the end, he learns that the reason she shows that defenseless side of her to him is because that's how much she trusts him. Back-to-back with that is revealed the ironic truth that the J.A. going out of control and the miracle that Misato and the others brought about were all plotted by Gendo, but the way Shinji begins to walk forward when he understands that his relationship with Misato has become closer is refreshing enough to even erase the sense of upset.
>
> ... The name of J.A comes from the robot, Jet Jaguar, which appeared in the special effects film Gozilla vs Megalon (1973). Jet Jaguar was a robot whose design was chosen from submissions from the public, and when it was initially announced, its name was Red Alone. Jet Alone is a name made by combining Red Alone and Jet Jaguar. It is truly a geeky GAINAX-like name.
>
> ... This episode depicts the actions of Eva Unit-02 and its pilot, Asuka Langley Sohryu. Starting here, the series charges into the second part, the "Action Arc," which depicts battles with various Angels in standalone episodes. The spirited character of Asuka ushers in a new phase of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Apparently, Asuka's character became solidified in Director Anno's mind when he came up with the lines "This is my Chance!" and "What are you, stupid?!"
>
> ... The contents of the trunk that Kaji is carrying looks like a human embryo and Gendo calls this "the first man, Adam." In Episode Seven in the SSTO conversation, they were talking about the "revised budget for the sample collection," but that sample is probably this Adam. Adam's existence is one of the greatest mysteries in this show. Could it be related to the Adam that appears in the Old Testament? The name of Adam's wife in the Old Testament is Eva.
>
> ... Episode Nine is also the episode where Asuka's character gets filled in. At the beginning in the scene where she talks to Rei at school, she is standing on the edge of the flower bed, but this is because in Director Anno's plans regarding her, one of the things was "she is a girl who endeavors to stand at a higher spot compared to the person she is addressing when greeting people." In Episode Eight, she also addresses Shinji from the top of the elevator.
>
> Asuka says, "This is the wall of Jericho, never to fall!" of the sliding door that separates the two rooms, but the "Wall of Jericho" is a reference to the Western film It Happened One Night (1934, America). In the movie, a rich runaway girl and an unemployed newspaper reporter end up spending a night in the same room, and they put a blanket as a divider, calling it the "Wall of Jericho." Incidentally, the original "Wall of Jericho" is a castle wall that appears in the Bible. Also, she says, "It is proper that boys and girls sleep apart after the age of seven," but the correct proverb is "it is proper that the boys and girls sit apart after the age of seven." This is a saying in the ancient Chinese Confucian text of The Book of Rites, and the seat refers to a straw mat. In ancient China, sitting on the same mat meant that the two were husband and wife. Is it the genius girl's pride that leads her to want to use difficult sayings, even though she's not supposed to be used to Japanese yet?
>
> ... At the beginning, Hyuga compares the data on the Seventh Angel and says, "Pattern blue, confirmed as an Angel," and at the time, the screen displays "BLOOD TYPE: BLUE." In the scene before that, with the data on the Sixth Angel that Ritsuko had analyzed, it also has "6th ANGEL pattern: BLOOD TYPE: BLUE." This indicates that it is an Angel. The term "BLOOD TYPE: BLUE" comes from a sci-fi film directed by Kihachi Okamoto called Blue Christmas (1978, Japan).
>
> [This Commentary tallies with [Patrick Yip's](http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/1998-October/022195.html) claims: The Japanese SF fans manage to trace the influence behind the decision of making "Blood Type Blue" the signal for discovery of "alien". They trace this to a quite-well-known Japanese SF writer (forgot his name) which wrote a SF in the 60's about some "blue-blood" people being hunted down by "ordinary" people and the main character in the story was forced to kill his girlfriend because she has "blue blood".']
>
> ... There is also a scene depicting the three operators taking a break between work. Maya Ibuki is reading a romance novel. Makoto Hyuga is reading a comic magazine. Shigeru Aoba has a music magazine next to him as he mimics playing a guitar. Aoba's hobby is to play the guitar, and in Episode Eleven, he can be seen coming to work with a guitar case containing an electric guitar. This was never realized, but there was an idea of having him play his guitar and singing nearby Shinji and the others in the final scene on the hill.
>
> The model that the Eighth Angel was based on was the Anomalocaris, the largest carnivore of the Cambrian Period. The Anomalocaris was taken up on the NHK Special Life - A Long Journey of 4 Billion Years (1994, Japan), and at the time the show aired, the creature was a hot topic.

> Furthermore, this is also the one and only Angel that appeared somewhere other than New Tokyo-3. Its object is believed to have been one of two things, either the Unit-02 being transported by the Pacific fleet or the contents of Ryoji Kaji's trunk.

  --<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol2_angel_profiles.htm>; shouldn't you guys know?

> This episode depicts the commotion and a battle with an Angel with the great blackout at NERV Headquarters in the background. Paper fans, candles, buckets and other small props that are generally not seen around NERV Headquarters make an appearance here. The "It's lukewarm" at the end of Part A is the one and only gag utilizing Gendo, but there are numerous humorous scenes, including when Hyuga takes over an election PR car and the various raggedy antics of the three Children. The glimpse into an awareness of the problem of modern life relying too much on a technological civilization could also be said to be very Director Hideaki Anno-like. The English subtitle is a reference to a sci-fi movie classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951, America)
>
> ... The animation for this episode was handled by Studio Ghibli, known for their work on such films as My Neighbor Totoro. Nozomu (written as "peek") Takahashi, the city assembly electoral candidate, who only appears as a name is a twist on the producer of Ghibli, Nozomu (written as "aspire") Takahashi.
>
> ... At the sea at the South Pole, where Gendo and Fuyutsuki travel on board an aircraft carrier, the waters are red and there are giant pillars of salt. This is also due to the effect of the Second Impact. Gendo calls the post-Second Impact South Pole "a world that has been purged, untainted by the original sin." In general, original sin refers to the sin Adam, the father of mankind, committed in "Genesis" of the Old Testament, as well as to the sin that all of mankind was burdened with as a result of it. In the conversation in this scene, it is revealed that Fuyutsuki and Gendo disagree on various topics, such as the Second Impact, mankind, and science. Fuyutsuki says, "I prefer the world where man lives, no matter how tarnished by sin it is." One wonders how he felt being involved in the Human Instrumentality Project.
>
> "By the hand of man" and "a miracle has value when it is brought about" are two lines that are familiar from some of Director Anno's previous works. In this episode, it is revealed that Rei dislikes meat, but Nadia: Secret of Blue Water was also a vegetarian. Director Anno himself is also famous for not eating meat. Incidentally, Rei orders a garlic ramen without the pork at a ramen shop, but the script has Rei ordering seaweed ramen. It is a rare example of pure adlibbing on the part of a voice actress in this show.
>
> ... The supercomputer MAGI is composed of three different computer systems, Melchior-1, Balthasar-2, and Casper-3. Various calculations, problems and operations are examined by these three. The naming of the MAGI come from the three wise men from the East, who foretold the birth of Jesus in the "New Testament." The names Melchior, Balthasar, and Casper are also taken from each of the wise men. The word "magi" also means "astrology" and is the origin of the English word "magician."
>
> In order to prevent the Angel from invading the lower regions of NERV headquarters, Gendo completely physically seals off the region in the Central Dogma below the Sigma Unit. The pyramid-shaped building standing in the Geo-front is but a small part of the NERV Headquarters. Stretching directly below the square lake adjoining the pyramid-shaped building is an incredibly deep facility going down approximately 7km. The majority of this incredibly deep facility is called the Central Dogma and the Sigma Unit is a part of it. Incidentally, the name Central Dogma came from biology. Genetic information is transferred DNA=>RNA=>protein, and this flow of genetic information is called the central dogma.
>
> ... Every so often, the show was aired at an irregular time in the Tokyo region, such as on January 3rd, when it was aired at 8 a.m., and thus, Episode Fourteen was created as a recap episode of sorts. The English subtitle is also a reference to the fact that this episode is a recap.
>
> ... Part A has no BGM, and there is also very little dialogue. The lack of "sound" and the heavy use of Bold Mincho captions create a stifling tension. The structure of displaying the subtitle at the end of Part A was also effective. In addition, in Part A, the names of the Angels and operations that had appeared up through Episode Twelve "The Value of a Miracle" became clear. The names of the Angels are the same as the names of angels that appear in the Bible, and each of their spheres of influence, characteristics, and the situations in which they appear are consistent. At the end of Part A, the terms "Dead Sea Scrolls" and "SEELE" appear for the first time. Generally, the "Dead Sea Scrolls" refers to the ancient documents discovered in a cave on the west bank of the Dead Sea in 1947. They contained the "Old Testament," the "Apocrypha," and other religious writings not included in the Bible. They are thought to be writings from around 200-100 B.C., meaning around the era that Christ was alive. Though it is said to be the greatest find of this century, full disclosure of it to the public was dragged out for another 45 years. Additionally, there is speculation that parts of it have been deliberately withheld from being released due to it containing writings that shake the very foundation of Christianity. It is unclear whether the "Dead Sea Scrolls" that they speak of are the actual "Dead Sea Scrolls." SEELE is the controlling organization of NERV and its members seem approximately the same as the Human Instrumentality Committee. Seele means "soul" in German.
>
> ... In the final scene, what Unit-02 is holding is the Spear of Longinus that was being transported from the South Pole in Episode Twelve. In the Bible, the Spear of Longinus is the spear that pierced Christ on the crucifix.

  --<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol3_episode_commentaries.htm>

> Starting with this episode, the drama is presented more densely, entering into the third part, which drives the theme strongly. The first episode in this part, Episode Fifteen, shines a spotlight on the human relationships between such people as Misato and Kaji, Shinji and Gendo, Asuka and Shinji, etc.
>
> ... Through Kaji's investigations, it is revealed that the organization created to select Eva pilots, the Marduk Institute, is largely insubstantial. The name for the Marduk Institute comes from a Babylonian god said to have 50 names. The god Marduk had 50 names, and the Marduk Institute in Eva was using 108 names.
>
> The homeostasis that Ritsuko mentioned is a biology term that refers to a quality that creatures have that allows them to maintain their physical and biological condition within stable levels and to survive in response to various changes in their environment. The American biologist Canon (Walter Bradford Canon: 1871 - 1945) proposed it as a universal principle of life. Combining that with its companion concept of transistasis to come up with the idea that "having these two contradictory qualities is what defines life" is original to this series.
>
> ... Episode sixteen depicts the fight against the Twelfth Angel that takes its opponent into imaginary space and Shinji's struggle within the inner space. This is an episode that could only be a part of Eva, possessing two very disparate appealing aspects in its depiction of sci-fi drama and the abyss that is the "human heart." And the scene of Shinji's inner space in the latter part of Part B could be said to be one of the finest examples of this. This sequence on board a train car at dusk with no one else present depicts the world of Shinji's heart in a most vivid way by using methods that could even be called experimental, such as expressing the character as a white "line" on a black screen and interjecting various images throughout the sequence. In addition, the image of "inside a mother's womb" can be taken from the entry plug that Shinji can't escape from, and the image of "giving birth" can be taken from the scene where Unit-01 escapes from within the Angel, covered in blood. Thus, this is also an episode with strong symbolism.
>
> In the inner space sequence, the question, "Is it okay to live by stringing only the happy things in life together like a rosary?" is presented, and later on, it becomes one of the themes carried throughout the series. In the same sequence, Shinji's mother, Yui Ikari, appears for the first time. Shinji's line, "No. Mother was smiling," serves as a foreshadowing to the mystery involving Yui. Also, there is a directional reason for why she is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara, who also voices Rei Ayanami.
>
> The episode title is a reference to "The Sickness Unto Death" (Sygdommen til Doden, 1849), the most important work put out by the father of existentialism, the philosopher Soren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-1855) of Denmark. "The sickness unto death" refers to "despair," and in the introduction of this work, Kierkegaard says that for a Christian, "Even death itself is not 'the sickness unto death.' Not to mention any of the suffering on Earth known as destitution, illness, misery, privations, misfortune, pain, anguish, grief, or regret." The English episode title, "Splitting of the Breast" refers to a psychological process by which an infant's impression of the breast becomes split into two, a "good object" and a "bad object."
>
> The "Dirac's sea" that took Shinji and Unit-01 in is a concept that the British theoretical physicist Dirac (Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac: 1902-1984) used in his hole theory. A vacuum is filled with negative energy electrons, and this is what is called "Dirac's sea."
>
> ... The three episodes spanning Episode Seventeen to Episode Nineteen are a serial piece called the "First Child Trilogy." This serial piece is the greatest climax in the middle of the series and also holds important meaning in terms of Shinji's drama. The first of these episodes, Episode Seventeen, is one that focuses on depicting daily life. The main plot is of Toji being chosen as the fourth Eva pilot and of how he finds his resolve concerning that, but at the same time, such things as Shinji's growth as a person, Rei's emotional uncertainty, and Hikaru's romantic feelings are also depicted. Episode Eighteen and Episode Nineteen, which follow, become more intense in terms of both drama and action. This episode is meant to be "the calm before the storm."

  --<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol4_episode_commentaries.htm>

> In a conversation with Kaji, Shinji says, "You know, I'm a man." So far, Misato and Asuka have repeatedly harangued him about, "You're a man, aren't you?" and he never offered a response, but now, he says this without a hitch. Does this mean he is feeling more at ease, just as Toji had said in Rei's room? It is also noteworthy that he looks at Toji with a smile as Toji stubbornly declares that cleaning is not a man's job. In Shinji and Kaji's conversation at the watermelon field, the topics covered are once again "enjoying" and "suffering," following up on the inner space in Episode Sixteen "The Sickness Unto Death, and..."
>
> The people who performed the English operator dialogue at the beginning were Michael House, George A. Arriola, and Hiromi Arriola. Michael House was a GAINAX employee at the time, who did m-house translation work. George A Arriola and Hiromi Arriola were friends of his and are apparently husband and wife.
>
> The English title for this episode is "Ambivalence." Ambivalence refers to a state where two contradictory emotions or attitudes exist at the same time within an individual. It was originally a psychoanalytical term, which was first used by a Swiss psychoanalyst, Bleuler (Paul Eugen Bleuler: 1857-1939). Perhaps the title of "Ambivalence" was given to this episode because Shinji is conflicted between his mission to defeat Unit-03 and his emotional reluctance to fight Unit-03, which has a human pilot on board.
>
> ... As the story unfolds, Shinji resolves to fight on his own and gets on board the Eva. And with a fierce battle that can truly be called "a man's battle," Episode Nineteen is upheld by the fans as having the most exciting content in the series. However, what in fact defeats the Angel is neither his resolve nor his fighting spirit, but the berserk Unit-01. Having aggressively faced the Angel, Shinji is taken in by Unit-01 as a result, and there is not even any portrayal of him realizing victory. In that sense, this episode also has a most Eva-like ironic structure.
>
> The English episode title "Introjection" is a psychoanalytic term meaning "to take in." It refers to taking in various attributes of another person and making it one's own. It is one form of a defense mechanism. For example, by taking in a mother's prohibitive or denying aspects, the super-ego is formed. Introjection is a term that refers to a phenomenon that occurs in the world of the psyche, but in this episode, it is likely used both in terms of its original meaning and how Unit-01 took in the Angel's abilities.
>
> In the entry plug, Shinji's body has become one with the LC.L. and separated from his psyche, Ritsuko sets a plan in motion to reconstruct his body and get his psyche to anchor itself in it. As the English episode title "Weaving A Story 2" indicates, this episode is a summary of sorts, like Episode Fourteen. In point of fact, it is made largely centered around the reuse of already existing composite material and film, however its contents do not look back on what happened in the past but tell a completely different story. Having become an existence solely consisting of his psyche, Shinji agonizes and suffers over things like "his relationship to others" and "the establishment of self." Depictions in his inner space is the locus of this episode and just as in Episode Sixteen, experimental methods are abundantly used. Also, with this episode as a turning point, This show begins to show a stronger tendency to directly portray "the human mind."
>
> Ritsuko says that the Eva "contains a human will" and that the fact Shinji was taken in "might be the Eva's will as well." Misato felt she was saying it jokingly, but when considered along with things like how the story unfolds later and how Ritsuko said, "So, she's awoken..." in Episode Nineteen, it becomes clear that what Ritsuko said is conveying the truth to Misato to a certain degree.
>
> Towards the end of Part A, Shinji recalls that he knew the Eva even earlier and that when he found out, he ran away from his mother and father. And the images of that flashback are the scene of the experiment from Episode Twenty-One "NERV Is Born," in which Yui Ikari is the subject. Shinji ran away from that site, and that incident is likely what planted the compulsive idea that he "must not run away".
>
> While the final scene at the love hotel contained no explicit images, the love scene was depicted boldly, which caused quite a stir when it was originally aired. After touching upon Misato's tryst, Ritsuko's line, "I guess I'm in no position to talk," is also curious.
>
> The English episode title "oral stage" is also a psychoanalytical term. The oral stage is the first stage of development in Freud's (Sigmund Freud: 1856-1939) libido development theory. It is the time period when the mouth serves as the principal source of pleasure. It is said that the oral stage starts at birth and ends around the age of 1 1/2. in the scene where Misato and Ritsuko are in the car, a radio DJ show can be heard from the car radio. We can suppose that this is the same show that was airing in Episode Twelve. A woman DJ is advising a listener on their romantic problems, but the term "oral stage" appears here as well. In this case, the oral stage refers to the oral personality. In other words, it points to personality tendencies that strongly lean towards being dependent and needy for love People with an oral personality happily sacrifice themselves in order to obtain the love of others. Shinji could be said to have an oral personality at this point in time.

> Neon Genesis Evangelion has numerous mysteries to engross the fans. After all 26 episodes of the TV series were aired, the remake version of Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode were released as a theatrical piece, in which several of the mysteries were resolved. Or there were clues presented with which to think about the mysteries. Furthermore, in the video version (released on LD and VHS at the time) of Episodes Twenty-One through Twenty-Four, which were released after the movie opened, new footage was added that also presented information regarding the mysteries.
<http://www.evamonkey.com/platinum_vol6_introduction.htm>

> If you look at Eva as a story whose protagonists are Gendo and Fuyutsuki, then the heroine would be Yui Ikari. She fascinates Fuyutsuki and she says, "He's quite a sweet person," of Gendo. Gendo's resolve to advance the Human Instrumentality Project is surely also related to her disappearance. Many mysteries, such as the Eva and Adam, the circumstances of Ayanami's birth, Unit-01 going out of control, etc., are linked with Yui's existence.
>
> ... When it was first aired on TV, it seems no few fans suspected that it was Misato that shot Kaji in this episode. In the "video version," dialogue explaining that SEELE has discovered that Kaji has delivered a sample of Adam to Gendo and has made his position precarious has been added and the way the scene where Kaji is shot connects to the next scene has been changed. It leads the audience to think that the culprit is someone on SEELE's side.
>
> ... In the fourth part, the drama unfolds taking an even deeper look into the characters. Not only Shinji, but Asuka, Rei, and Misato are put through hearth-wrenching experiences. In Episode Twenty-Two, the spotlight is on the Unit-02 pilot, Asuka Langley Sohryu. It becomes clear why she had been so hung up on the Eva and worked so excessively hard, and when that is uncovered by the Angel, she loses her psychological balance. Just as it holds true for the Fifteenth Angel that appears in this episode, non of the Angels that appear in the fourth part launch brute force attacks, but instead, try to shake the Eva pilots psychologically.
>
> The big additions in the "video version" are the carrier at the beginning, the scene where Asuka is looking at Shinji and Rei at the station, and the bath scene. The highlight is the struggle in Asuka's inner space when she is being attacked psychologically, which took as much as 70 cuts to accomplish. In the station scene, she speaks nastily of Shinji and Rei's relationship, saying, "He is totally back to his usual thing again." Perhaps Asuka thought that the two were a couple or at least in a relationship close to it. Note that in the struggle in her inner space, a scene where she is hanging her head in dejection with the sliding door closed has been newly inserted after the scene from Episode Nine, "Moment and Heart Together," where she shuts the sliding door. And likewise, after the kiss scene from Episode Fifteen, "Lies and Silence," there is a new scene showing her looking frustrated after rinsing her mouth. And from Asuka's dialogue that overlaps these scenes, it becomes clear that she has been looking for help and love from Shinji.
>
> ... In the fourth part, the effectiveness of certain important scenes has been increased by the use of well-known classical pieces as BGM. The piece used in this episode is Handel's oratorio "Messiah." Messiah means savior and the lyrics have been taken from the Bible. The piece portrays the prophecy of Christ's birth all the way to his resurrection in three parts.
>
> ... Episode Twenty-Three is the episode where the spotlight falls on Rei Ayanami. The secrets of her inner thoughts, her death, and her third self are depicted. This is also the episode where Ritsuko's drama is depicted, and just as the title "Tears" indicates, Rei cries in the first half and Ritsuko cries in the second half. The way the story unfolds in a cool, detached way in spite of the fact the episodes portrays the life and death, and the love and hate, of the characters is very much in character with this show.
>
> ... Standing before the Reis in the tank, Ritsuko speaks of the relationship between Rei and the dummy plugs, and also of the relationship between "God" and the Evas. It is a scene that provides the greatest amount of information regarding the mysteries in Eva. What exactly is this "God" who disappeared 15 years ago? Was it not Adam appeared 15 years ago? She said that the "God" humans resurrected was Adam, but is this Adam the embryo-like Adam that showed up in Episode Eight? Or could it possibly be the giant underground? In the same scene, Ritsuko says, "The Chamber of Gaf was empty, you see." The Chamber of Gaf, according to Hebrew legends, is a room in the house of God in Heaven where the souls dwell. Babies receive a soul from this room before they are born. It is said that if there are no more souls in the Chamber of Gaf, it is an omen that the world will fall to ruin.

> Up to this point, Neon Genesis Evangelion has depicted themes surrounding "the human heart" and "communication between people" through the stories of the main characters.  However, the climactic episodes, Episode Twenty-Five "The World Ending" and the Final Episode "The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World," reverse the relationship between the story and the theme. What would normally be considered the story is kept to the bare minimum and "the theme itself" is told. The material is theoretical and experimental, and without a doubt, something never seen before in TV animation. When it originally aired, it became an incredibly hot topic and divided the fans in their opinion.
> The conclusion to the drama and illuminating the mysteries. In response to fans clamoring for those two things, it was decided that there would be a remake of Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode.  The result of that are Episode 25 "Air" and Episode 26 "A Pure Heart For You," which were released as the theatrical "The End of Evangelion."
> Thus, the story of Eva would branch into two stories with the diverging point being the end of Episode Twenty-Four "The Final Messenger."  The two stories each unfold differently and arrive at their own climaxes.  Episode Twenty-Five and the Final Episode tell the theme directly.  And the other version, Episode 25 and Episode 26, depict the same, following the story.  It is not that one is the complete version and the other is incomplete.  Just like the multiple endings of a game, two different endings were prepared for one story.

> Kaworu only appears in this episode of the show, but his unique atmosphere and his relationship with Shinji led to his character garnering overwhelming support from female fans. When you disassemble the character for his last name, "Nagisa", it becomes "shi" and "sha". Thus, it is a play on the sub-title, "The Final Messenger (saigo no shisha)". The "Nagisa (shore)" also forms a pair with Rei Ayanami's "nami (wave)".
>
> Only the fourth movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Opus 125 "Choral" is used as BGM in this episode. Event what Kaworu is humming when he first appears and what Shinji is listening to on the S-DAT are from No. 9, showing quite a thoroughness. During the climax, it plays for over 7 minutes making a strong impact on the audience. The lyrics for the choral "Ode to Joy" are from the poem "To Joy" by the German poet and playwright, Schiller. There is a passage in those lyrics that goes, "We enter, drunk with your fire, Oh heavenly one, into your sanctuary." it can be thought of as linking to the content of the second half of this episode.
>
> ... This is a singular piece of work with an exceedingly experimental structure. In spite of the story unfolding only through monologues and conversations between characters, the directing does a brilliant job maintaining the high tension. When it was originally aired, many voiced their opinion that they could not understand the story in Episode Twenty Five and the Final Episode. However, there is actually a bare-bones explanation of the story within the show. That being… Gendo uses Rei to execute the Human Instrumentality Project and the complementation of man begins. Seeing the remakes, Episode 25 "Air" and Episode 26 "A Pure Heart For You", may in fact make the content of Episode Twenty-Five easier to understand. The depictions of Misato and Ritsuko being shot to death, Unit-02 hugging its knees in the lake, and Asuka likewise hugging her knees within Unit-02 all correspond to Episode 25.
>
> Gendo says, "All souls will become one and find eternal peace". His Instrumentality Project must have been for all human souls to be combined as one and to compensate each other for what they have been deprived of. In the story that follows from Episode 25 "Air" to Episode 26 "A Pure Heart For You", he was not able to execute the scenario he had drawn up. It may be that it was in Episode Twenty-Five and Episode Twenty-Six that his wish actually came true.
>
> The English subtitle, "Do you love me?" is from the book of the same title written by a British psychotherapist named R.D. Laing (Ronald David Laing: 1927-1989). It is a work that is done in a distinctive style as a discourse between individuals, and the style in which this episode is advanced through conversations between the characters is reminiscent of "Do you love me?"
>
> ... "Vividly drawing people" is a distinct quality of this show, and it was also the creative theme. In that sense, stepping deeper into Misato's mind using the reason she slept with Kaji as a lead into it can be called the end point for Neon Genesis Evangelion in depicting people.
>
...
> This is the final episode of the TV series. The year is 2016 A.D., and the complementation of mankind is ongoing. Shinji agonizes over the value of his existence and his relationship with other people and comes to a conclusion. The subtitle "The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World" is from a story by American sci-fi author Harlan Ellison (1934 - ) of the same name. Taking the subtitle of the final episode from a sci-fi novel is a tradition of Director Anno's works, continuing from Aim for the Top! and Nadia: Secret of Blue Water. The "love (ai)" being written in katakana is likely a play on the "love (ai)" and the English "I".
>
> The final episode also takes the unusual route of unfolding entirely within what appears to be the world within Shinji's mind. In terms of technique, there are also various modes of expression used in abundance, such as still photographs, paper anime, and illustrations. Director Anno and the animator You Yoshinari are the ones who did the key animation for the paper anime.
>
> ... The moment that Shinji gains conviction that it is okay for him to be there, the background changes, and the blue Earth spreads beneath his feet. However, there are no continents on this Earth, and it is covered by a gigantic coral reef. It seems this is the Earth that has been transfigured by the Instrumentality Project. This episode ends with the captions "To my father, thank you." "To my mother, farewell." "And to all the Children." "Congratulations!" Eva is something of an Oedipus complex story, where a boy feels love and hatred for his father and mother, so the first two captions can be thought to means that Shinji has come to an understanding with his father and grown out of his dependence on his mother. Perhaps the latter two captions mean, "This is a world where all the children born into it deserve to live." It is left for the audience to decide whether this ending is the Best Ending or the Bad Ending.

> Taking him to the airport after Fanime one year, I asked Hiroyuki Yamaga about Anno and Miyamura, whether it was true they were going out (which was the story I had heard--not the story that she rebuffed him). If you've ever seen THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO, he was kind of reclining back in the car seat at the time like Jigen was, just before they blew the tire. He sort of gave a "where'd you hear *that*?" response. Mr. Yamaga is usually not shy about gossiping about Anno, which leads me to believe either 1. they were never going out (90% possibility) or 2. they were but jealousy forebade him from confirming it (10% possibility).
>
> ... It's quite possible that this struggle was interpreted instead as a struggle with Anno, which certainly made for juicier rumors. Nor was it all that far-fetched, as there was at times a great deal of tension within Gainax over the making of EVA.
>
> Anno was also at one time romantically linked with Ayako Fujitani, whose novel "Shikijitsu" he, of course, adapted into film. They apparently first met when she was starring in the remakes of the GAMERA series (Yamaga claimed at one time the real reason Anno walked away from KARE KANO was because he was too busy editing his "making of GAMERA" documentary). Ms. Fujitani is, of course, also the daughter of Steven Seagal, making the rumored relationship not without great personal risk.

> Bryan was taking some video of the people walking by as a snapshot of everyday people. Because it was Saturday afternoon, some of the people traveling through the station were school students returning home after a half-day at school. Of course, they were wearing uniforms of the style we learned to expect in anime. Although it may appear obvious and natural to some of you, my impression of everything we saw in Japan that matched what I had seen in anime was changing my impression of the country and its culture. What I came to realize is how accurately anime portrays many elements of Japanese culture. This means that I had to reevaluate the impression of Japan that anime had given me, and look more closely at what I had previously not considered accurate portrayals of everyday life: the sound crows make, the layout of city streets and railways, the hustle and bustle of daily life at a train station, the zoning laws, what people wear, what they look like, how they color their hair (^_^), what they eat for breakfast, the size and thickness of one slice of bread (^_^), and so on.
>
> ... Note: I'm not absolutely certain these are the reasons, nor are they necessarily the sole reasons, for Anno's departure from the production of Kare-Kano.
>
> Anno objected to the restrictions placed on TV anime by TV Tokyo after the Pocket Monster incident, so in protest, he decided to have nothing more to do with TV Tokyo and left the production of Kare-Kano in the hands of Sato, who joined Gainax after having worked for the government in a public works management position.

> What was I agonizing over, you ask? Well, when the subject of buying drapes came up, I asked Anno if he had any color preferences, and he replied, "Red." If I were buying scarves, that would be one thing, but come on... (Translator's note: If you get the "Red Scarf" reference, go to the head of the class, and explain it to someone who doesn't--if you dare.--MH) There really isn't much in the way of red curtains, at least, not off the shelf. So I settled for a color mix that would at least show that I'd made a hard try to meet Anno's request.

> "The End's main characters are a man and a woman, Shinji and Asuka, and director Hideaki Anno when he does not present himself through Misato, Gendo, or every other character in the series identifies with them both (gossip links him romantically with Asuka's voice actress, Yuko Miyamura). As Anno explained at the outset of the series, in an essay reprinted this month in Viz's collected Book One of the Evangelion manga, he began this because he felt sick, and the final line of The End, spoken by Asuka back to Shinji, could not put things any more plain."
>
> "This is The End of Evangelion. It is the same ending as that of the television series. It is told big-budget, stitched with bullets, limned with guts, and tagged with blood, in case it was too subtle the first time. But it is the same ending. You will see all this: a man, stunted in emotion, has a special gift within him. He can move his human hands and feet with the stride and reach of a giant. Because he knew love once, and lost it, he sketched one map on his floor where he stood and one in the sky above, until he had drawn between them a world of mysteries and wonders, a world of things to love and of those in love. But when they put their hands towards him, he drew away; when he put his hands on them, they were cold and still. In his frustration, he tightened his grip to take satisfaction by force: a load shot to nowhere, a stranglehold on beauty, clenched fists battering down his creation, until there was nothing left but himself again."

> By breaking with the long-standing tradition of basing their animated works on pre-existing stories and folk tales, GAINAX has been credited with freeing animation from the constraints which have allowed it to be perceived as a derivative medium. In so doing, they have established animated film as a self-sufficient art form (Time Magazine, November 22, 1999).

>  In a recent issue, Rolling Stone proclaimed Nirvana's Kurt Cobain to have been, for western popular music, the Artist of the Decade. I have no problem with that assessment, any more than I have in saying Evangelion's Hideaki Anno should hold that title for Japanese animation. But both made their statement when there was still plenty of Nineties left: Cobain killed himself in 1994 and Anno's pop culture suicide happened in either the spring of '96, when Eva had its controversial TV ending, or in the summer of '97, with its even more talked-about movie ending-you may take your pick. Therefore, the reason Cobain and Anno deserve the title is not that their talent bestrode the decade like a headless colossus, but because they posed the question of what will you do, now that you know to all those that came after them. Evangelion suggested, as Nirvana did in both their first and last song, "you could do anything, you could do anything..." Yet it seemed that few in TV anime chose to respond to Eva's example of freedom of expression. In 1998, serial experiments lain (the title is in lower-case) came and went from Japanese television in a mere thirteen episodes. But it was enough to show that lain's creators, scriptwriter Chiaki Konaka (whose previous Armitage III was also produced and released by Pioneer) and newcomer Ryutaro Nakamura had understood the possibilities and chose to seize upon them.

> Evangelion is an ambiguous product. On the one hand it strongly appeals to otaku's sensibilities, (2) but on the other it implies radical criticism against otaku's mentality....
>
> In a sense, Evangelion is extremely interior and is lacking in sociality, so that it seems to reflect pathology of the times. I think for some people it is nothing more than a bad product which is simply to increase otakus.
>
> For instance, some Japanese critics, such as Eiji Otsuka and Tetsuya Miyazaki, criticized Evangelion TV series on the grounds that the last two episodes, in which interior monologue of Shinji, the hero, went on all the time, were like brainwashing or psycho-therapy, and it was only a self-affirmation of otaku's autistic tendency for escapism. Yoshiyuki Tomino, who had once directed several epoch-making animes such as Gundam and Ideon, (3)-these animes had a great influence on Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion-also criticized Evangelion bitterly on the grounds that it is something like clinical records of a morbid person who confines himself to the world of information and cannot realize actuality....
>
> The latter half of Evangelion TV series, especially the last two episodes clearly had intention to break the closed domain of anime that keeps on offering narcissistic pleasure to otakus, that is, Evangelion had intention to crack the closed domain of anime, not from the outside, but from the inside, remaining within it, just as its purity is highest, or to make joy of anime self-destruct at the utmost limits.
>
> The last part of Evangelion TV series-in which the progress of the story was stopped by Shinji's interior monologue and he came to affirm himself groundlessly, saying "I can stay here!"-was not a play for the salvation of the self-some people misread it so-like brainwashing or psycho-therapy, but something like harassment with malice and irony to some anime fans. I think the last message of the last episode of the TV series-"Congratulations to all the children!"-was a quotation from the last scene of Yoshiyuki Tomino's anime movie The Ideon (1982), as many people have already pointed out it. In the last scene of The Ideon, after the human race had died out, the souls of the dead characters were drifting in outer space and they heard the singing, "Happy birthday dear children!" That is ironic, in short, the last episode of Evangelion TV series implies that closed and self-sustained interiority is nothing other than a kind of "death." It is death of the self as loss of the other. It also implies that the world of joy for otakus such as the first half of Evangelion TV series cannot help coming to a death on account of its closeness....
>
> The world of the first half of Evangelion TV series, which had been full of joy of anime, collapsed gradually in the latter half: In the 18th episode, Evangelion Unit-01-Shinji was inside it-attacked Evangelion Unit-03 as an "Angel," and Touji, the pilot of Evangelion Unit-03 and Shinji's classmate, got badly wounded and lost a leg. In the 22nd episode, Asuka, the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, became as good as the living dead because of Angel's psychic attack, getting non compos mentis. In the 23rd episode, Rei, the pilot of Evangelion Unit-00-in the episode it was found that she was something like a clone created from Shinji's mother-blew herself up in order to protect Shinji from Angel's attack, and the city Shinji lived in-Third New Tokyo City-became a ruin. In the 24th episode, Shinji was forced to kill Kaoru, a boy who was Shinji's beloved friend, as an Angel, or enemy. In the last two episodes, the progress of the story was stopped and the work Evangelion itself broke down as if to reject a completion of itself as an anime. It is, as it were, closing of the world, or "death" itself....
>
> The latter half of Evangelion TV series, in which a world of joy was collapsing and closing because it was simply hedonistic and regressive, reminds me of Mamoru Oshii's anime movie Urusei Yatsura 2 Beautiful Dreamer (1984). (4) In Beautiful Dreamer, an endless slapstick comedy at a high school like Urusei Yatsura TV series-Oshii himself had directed the TV series-is depicted as an ideal world to Lum, the heroine, or an occurrence in Lum's inner space. In the world, the progress of time has stopped and one and the same day-the day before the school festival-is being repeated over and over. In the inner space, the people who were hindrances to Lum vanished one after another, and the town she lived in became a ruin except for the house Ataru Moroboshi-the hero and Lum's "darling"-lived in and a convenience store nearby. The more the purity of the world as Utopia to Lum is enhanced, the more the closeness and fictitiousness of the world become prominent. Ataru wandered about in the world of inner spaces like this and then tried returning from the infinite chain of the inner spaces like "dreams" to "actuality."
>
> The End of Evangelion presented the thesis that actuality is the end of a dream. Concerning the thesis, Oshii's Beautiful Dreamer precedes Anno's Evangelion. If the world of Urusei Yatsura TV series had switched suddenly to the level of Beautiful Dreamer, it would have been similar to the last two episodes of Evangelion TV series. The reason that Evangelion TV series seemed to break down at the conclusion was that the shift-from fiction to meta-fiction-was too sudden and self-destructive. It may be that the people who showed rejection reaction to the last two episodes of the TV series could not bear its irony and self-referentiality.
>
> The world where Shinji operated Evangelion Unit-01 and fought against the Angels, the world of a comic love story at a junior-high school, in which there were no Evangelions or Angels (the last episode of the TV series), the world where the people congratulated Shinji and he came to affirm himself groundlessly, and the world where Shinji, Asuka, Rei and Kaoru were rehearsing a string quartet at a hall of school (Evangelion: Death)... It can be thought that each of these worlds was an occurrence in inner space, or one of parallel worlds. The theme of Evangelion is, so to speak, the world as interiority.
>
> ...Maybe Evangelion gave up being a story at a certain point in time, I think. In the 6th episode of the TV series, Shinji and Rei, who were "closed-minded children," fought together against an Angel and "opened their minds," exchanging smiles with each other. Although this scene was probably first climax of the series, maybe Neon Genesis Evangelion as a story of "growth and independence of a boy"-like a Bildungsroman-ended there once. Evangelion as a story has stopped there.^[It is interesting to compare this to Anno's [comments in _Prano_](#prano) - how he thought Rei's character development suddenly stopped at Rei's first smile and he had made a mistake by letting it happen so early on.]
>
> ...The End of Evangelion, released as a movie, is a remake of the last two episodes of the TV series, and it is the last program of Evangelion series. I think the largest point in dispute connected with the evaluation of this last program is this. Did Evangelion only end in a self-affirmation of closed interiority, or did it show the way to get out of prison of self-consciousness?
>
> It seems some people anticipated that the movie version of Evangelion would end as a story of "growth and independence of a boy," like a Bildungsroman, but The End of Evangelion avoided such a popular ending and was completed as works that renewed the last two episodes of the TV series in another way. The End of Evangelion is a repetition and variation of the theme presented in the latter half of the TV series. It is not an ending of a story.
>
> ...This [EoE] ending can be regarded as criticism against religion, because it avoided an ideological/aesthetic solution and faced the ugly reality. It is highly ethical. The people, who equated Evangelion with motivational seminar or the Aum Shinrikyo cult and called it 'techno-mysticism', should be ashamed of their thoughtlessness.
>
> In my view, The End of Evangelion ended on the phase when Shinji, the hero, found Asuka as "the other." For Shinji, Asuka is an ambiguous existence. On the one hand she lectures and inspires him because she minds him, but on the other she is also an existence beyond his control-the other that can never be interiorized. Asuka's ambiguity is also the ambiguity of the work Evangelion as it is.
>
> The last two episodes of Evangelion TV series and The End of Evangelion have a relation like a Möbius strip. They are the two views of one and the same theme. The discovery of the other in The End of Evangelion is the reverse expression of the loss of the other in the last two episodes of the TV series. The unsophisticated people who could not read the irony in the last two episodes of the TV series will probably overlook the critical essence of The End of Evangelion as well.

> "...Hideaki Anno's TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) has a soundtrack that is so Japanese it will be decades before Occidental forms of audiovisual entertainment begin to successfully mimic it. Not only does Evangelion have many memorable vocal performances (Shinji, his father Gendo, the other 'children' Rei and Asuka) but there is a total logic to the sound design which both typifies its 'Japaneseness' and qualifies the role of the recorded voice within its aural netting. In fact, it should never be forgotten that 'sound design' is the creation of a sonic logic wherein all elements are orchestrated in accordance to our peculiar and precise understanding of how an imagined reality would acoustically operate and psychoacoustically resonate. To understand how any one element - a voice, for example - appears, happens and/or is rendered in a narrative form, one must wholly investigate the narrative's sonic logic. Neon Genesis Evangelion exemplifies 4 primary categories of audiovisual narrativity which define the sense of its soundtrack: mecha design, musical eclecticism, spatio-temporal rupture, and emotional compaction.
>
> The design of mechanical devices and machines - known as mecha design - is an important area of pre-production in Japanese entertainment. In manga and anime , objects are imagined, envisaged and designed as if they have to be used. That is, their logic is based less on their 'look' (a very Western notion that joins DaVincian optics and modernist sensibilities) and more on their tactility. Virtually all Japanese design promotes an erotic relation between user and machine, between object and hand, between shape and body. This pervades everything from a Kawasaki motorbike to Sailor Moon's skirt. Most importantly, the 'look' of objects in Japanese design is accepted as a separate and auxiliary aspect of the objects' purpose and function. Bank machines can be based on the look of tomatoes; skyscrapers on milk cartons; cars on deep sea crustaceans; perfume bottles on carburettors. They each will do what is required of them, so there is not real reason for them to speciously prove their existence through their look. (This is but yet another aspect of the 'calligraphic' in Japanese culture, where an image or a look is embraced as pure visual substance with no referent to the real.) The design of machinery in Japanese manga and anime is therefore a prime textual layer in the many futuristic scenarios wherein man and machine exist in a complexly modulated harmony. It is no surprise then that Japanese sound designers for anime obey the logic of the mecha design, carefully analysing issues of weight, density, force, energy and mass before they even start to imagine the acoustic and transmissive properties of the machines.
>
> ...Secondly, each of the Angels (the diabolical threat to Earth) has their own look and an equally distinctive sound. This is especially noticeable due to the design of the Angels whose visuality references a series of modernist and ancient archetypes of biomorphic form - from Aztec wall paintings to Miro's murals to Donald Judd cubes. Amazingly compounded sound effects accompany their terrible force, based on the power of violence they unleash on Tokyo 3. And despite the problem in designing sound for such impossible imaginings, an effective 'mismatching' of unexpected sounds with unexpected forms/shapes/beings runs throughout Neon Genesis Evangelion .
>
> ...Japanese anime has consistently offered alternatives to the Wagnerian leit motiv approach to serially repositioning a melodic refrain or theme throughout a film score. While this approach has typified both romantic and modernist film scoring, anime employs a string of motifs which effectively cancel each other out - or at least render their significance fluid and unfixed. Americans have often commented on how the Japanese place their music cues in the 'wrong' place - as if George Lucas and John Williams control the universal imagination. The use of New Jack Swing in Blue Seed (1995), Electro-Ambient in Please Save My Earth (1995) and Prog Rock in La Filliette Revolutionaire [_Revolutionary Girl Utena_] (1997) as score rather than sourced songs further typifies this seeming 'wrongness' about anime. The European orchestral machine is employed in anime for pure effect - not because 'that's how movie music should sound'. Further, there is usually no governing or determining style in any one anime. Shiroh Sagisu's score to Evangelion at varying times sounds like The Thunderbirds, FM-soft rock, Steve Reich and Ken Ishii. but the result of this eclecticism is not arched, strained or postmodern: it simply mutates and evolves in response to the surges and pulsations in the location and dispersion of dramatic energy.
>
> While the score to Evangelion seems to simulate a radio station programmed in a chaotic random fashion, there is a purpose behind such chopping and changing. For the future in Evangelion - like the post-apocalyptic continuum which paves the way for Japan's unsettling existence - is on the brink of destruction, and all that is calm is merely the potential for radical destabilization. Spatio-temporal rupture thus rages throughout Evangelion. Often we are caught in the claustrophobic mind of young Shinji as he grapples with an aching existential dilemma of how to live alone, divorced from social and human contact. The screen will go black, white, or assault the eye with Pokemon-style strobe-cutting; radical shifts in sound density will accompany these visual ruptures. Silence screams and pierces the soundtrack; detonations capitulate to a soft roar; all energies are continually inverted and reversed to complement and counterpoint their dramatic weight. Sometimes complete sections of plot disappear to convey Shinji's loss of consciousness inside an Eva. Sometimes his psychic sensitivity teleports him unexpectedly to ill-defined locales and spaces. The musique concrete collage of sounds and atmospheres which play with these spatio-temporal ruptures is never gratuitous. If the sound design - like the music - in Japanese anime sounds 'wrong' it is not simply because we aren't listening carefully enough, but that we are not cogniscent of the way that Japanese sound reflects narrative, rather than neutralizing it as does Western audiovisual entertainment.
>
> ...Not that Japanese characters behave 'differently', but that the schisms which we perceive as corrupting and interfering with a character's identity are acknowledged as the substance of a character's identity. In the West, we will crudely designate the hero, the buffoon, the cynic, the sage, etc.; in the East, characters are founded upon their schizophrenia, established through their multiplicity, and defined by their inability to be grounded. Evangelion's characters - especially the three 'children' who complexly represent Japan's own problematized Generation-X - are formed by means of emotional compaction. Joy harmonizes grief; suffering prompts laughter; compassion folds violence; hatred suppresses innocence. Evangelion's characters are quintessentially good, bad and ugly. Music, sound and voice dance in intricately orchestrated lines that map out these characters not as containers or vessels of emotion, but shimmering and shifting apparitions of emotional complexity - not 'rounded out' by authorial conceit, but unrefined as befits the prickly irrationality which dictates our everyday exchanges."

> Tomino: For instance, Brain Powered came out after Evangelion did, so I am often asked questions similar to yours about the connection between them, but in reality the plans for Brain Powered and the overall story had all been completed before Evangelion came out. I never meant Brain Powered to be an antithesis to Evangelion. I knew when I saw Evangelion that Brain Powered would be called an antithesis to it, but I didn't want to change my plans any, so I just resigned myself to that.
>
> This is connected with my wish for more animators to see themselves as entertainers. I don't think I succeeded with Brain Powered, and I don't think it was very good with entertainment--but there was one thing I did try to do with it. If 100 people come to see an anime with giant robots, then chances are that not every one of those 100 people will be a huge fan of robot anime. What I wanted to do was to make an anime that had a truly interesting story that wouldn't cause the people who watched it to have a nervous breakdown. I also tried to make a story that would tell anime fans that there were often other things out there better than anime. That's the goal I challenged myself to do. I don't think the series itself was a success, though, I have to admit that.
>
> So I was very upset when I saw Evangelion, because it was apparent to me that the people who made it weren't thinking at all about making fun for or gaining the sympathy of the audience. Instead they tried to convince the audience to admit that everybody is sick, practically in the middle of a nervous breakdown, all the time. I don't think you should show things like that to everybody. It's not entertainment for the masses--it's much more interested in admitting that we're all depressed nervous wrecks, I thought. It was a work that told people it was okay to be depressed, and it accepted the psychological state that said if you don't like the way the world works, then it's okay to just pick up a gun and attack someone. I don't think that's a real work of art. When people see that, they begin to realize they are the same way. I think that we should try to show people how to live healthier, fuller lives, to foster their identity as a part of their community, and to encourage them to work happily until they die. I can't accept any work that doesn't say that.

> Some of the jokes, gags, and elements in FLCL are subcultural, and if it was very difficult for him to explain some of the elements to the staff, it may be even more so to Americans—or so is his assumption. Tsurumaki told the Otakon panel, "Honestly speaking, I'm very happy that Americans like my work, but the Eva TV series and movies, KareKano, and FLCL are basically made for the Japanese audiences. So when I hear that they are being well received by American audiences, I feel very happy; but at the same time I feel a little awkward."
>
> When PULP asked him what he meant by that, Tsurumaki said, "For example, in Eva, I thought Shinji's character would only be understood by Japanese fans of this generation. But I was very happy—or actually, shocked—to find out that his kind of character is also understood by Americans." I appreciated the director's implied vote of confidence in us, but wondered whether the oft-remarked-upon Japanese sense of cultural singularism was strong enough to cancel out the universal fact of youth disaffection, let alone the worldwide reporting on incidents such as the murders at Columbine.
>
>Another person at Tsurumaki's press conference took up that question. Tsurumaki averred that Shinji's character was based personally on that of Hideaki Anno. Tsurumaki's version of the metaphor was that Shinji being summoned by his father to pilot the Evangelion stood for Anno being "summoned" by Gainax to direct their first anime in four years, and his in five—he traced Anno's ambiguous feelings about his craft back to Nadia. At the same time, said Tsurumaki, Anno felt, "But maybe by doing Eva I can change, I can grow."
>
> Most of the Gainax shows are also targeted, Tsurumaki said, for an audience "that tends to be rather weak and has problems with their family"—and the directors at Gainax are those kind of people. "A lot of families in Japan a generation ago—and perhaps even now—had fathers that were workaholics and never home. They were out of their children's' lives. My own father was like that, and I hardly ever got to associate with him until quite recently. I'm the same sort of person as Hideaki Anno. That probably influences the type of anime I create."
>
> Nevertheless, if Tsurumaki feels that he will never be safe, he will never be sane, he wanted to express that frantic inside in a comedic mode, rather than with the violent convulsions of Evangelion. Simply put, he personally was ready for a contrast to that apocalyptic darkness. Tsurumaki compares the bizarre robots popping forth from Naota's head to stir up the town in FLCL to the bizarre ideas popping forth from his head during its production, stirring up the post-Eva Gainax. For someone involved with such a talked-about film, Tsurumaki hardly ever watches movies himself, telling the panel he receives influences instead from Japanese TV dramas and manga, his favorite being those of Leiji Matsumoto.

> None of the Evangelion production staff are themselves of a Western religious background. Tsurumaki, for his own part as assistant director, said at Otakon that he always envisioned the extensive use of Judeo-Christian iconography in Evangelion to be more of a way for the show to distinguish itself visually in the mecha field. Evangelion's eschatology is in fact too well-developed to be regarded as a mere motif, however if it is a syncretic, symbolic and esoteric approach, it is not an ignorant one. Tsurumaki remarked that Eva, being a show only meant for Japan, allowed Gainax to creative freedom in the use of Western elements, removing any concern about how their interpretation might cause offense. By the same token, Yamaga has expressed a sense of relief that Gainax couldn't be easily smeared with the media hysteria over Aum Shinri Kyo, since Evangelion's own high-tech cultists used Western, not Buddhist, revelations. It should be obvious that if this is viewed as an armor for Evangelion to comment on contemporary Japanese events, it is an effective one—an applicability many Japanese critics in fact accepted.

> P: Do you think, then, that the distinctive Gainax projects are the ones which actually originate from within the studio, rather then their adaptations of someone else's work?
>
> KT: It depends on the time in which it was released, but yes, works like Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise, Gunbuster, Nadia, and FLCL would be considered the ones with the true Gainax flavor, their milestones.

> Tsurumaki said he was surpassed that Shinji Ikari was understood so well by North American Evangelion fans, and admitted that Shinji was modeled after the director Hideaki Anno. "Shinji, he gets summoned by his father to ride a robot, and Anno was summoned by Gainax to make a big animation show after he had had a problem with Nadia of the Mysterious Seas and didn't know if he still wanted to direct." Some fans think that the extreme violence in End of Evangelion was inspired by fans' disapproval of Anno, but Tsurumaki said that was not the case. "It wasn't a bitterness toward the fans. A lot of people think anime should always have happy endings, but that's not always the case. We wanted to educate the fans that anime can have bitter endings."

> "Why does Evangelion end violently, and somewhat unhappily?
>
> KT: People are accustomed to sweet, contrived, happy endings. We wanted to broaden the genre, and show people an ugly, unhappy ending.
>
> Why is the character of Shinji portrayed as he is?
>
> KT: Shinji was modeled on director Hideaki Anno. Shinji was summoned by his father to ride a robot, Anno was summoned by Gainax to direct an animation. Working on Nadia [Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water, one of Anno and Tsurumaki's earlier projects] he wondered if he still wanted to work like this. He thought that working on Eva could help him to change.
>
> Is there any particular reason why so many Gainax series feature very anxious, unhappy young male protagonists with no parents?
>
> KT: Yes, the directors at Gainax are all basically weak, insecure, bitter, young men. So are many anime fans. Many Japanese families, including my own, have workaholic fathers whose kids never get to see them. That may influence the shows I create.
>
> Could you explain the mecha bursting from Naota's head in FLCL?
>
> KT: I use a giant robot being created from the brain to represent FLCL coming from my brain. The robot ravages the town around him, and the more intensely I worked on FLCL the more I destroyed the peaceful atmosphere of Gainax.
>
> Why doesn't FLCL follow one story?
>
> KT: In the third episode Ninamori was almost a main character, a kid who, like Naota, has to act like an adult. After episode three her problem was solved so we wrote her out. She has many fans in Japan and we got plenty of letters about that decision. For FLCL I wanted to portray the entire history of Gainax, and each episode has symbols of what happened behind the scenes on each of Gainax's shows. Episode one has many elements of KareKano; episode two, a lot of Evangelion references, etc.
>
> Where does the title FLCL come from?
>
> KT: I got the idea from a CD in a music magazine with the title Fooly-Cooly. I like the idea of titles that are shortened long English words. Pokemon for "Pocket-Monsters" for instance, and an old J-pop band called Brilliant Green that was known as "Brilly-Grilly."
>
> Is there any reason why the extra scenes added to Eva for the video release were cut in the first place? Did you think the story would mean something different with them intact?
>
> KT: The scenes that were added to Eva for its video release aren't that important. We added them as an apology for taking so long to get the video out. Maybe they'll help people understand things, because the episodes were done under tough deadlines the first time around.
>
> Earlier today you said that you were trying to broaden the genre by giving Eva a sad ending. Does the sameness of much of today's anime bore you?
>
> KT: First of all we didn't use a sad ending to annoy fans. When they're upset, that really bothers us. Personally, I think a happy ending is fine, but not if it is achieved too easily. That's no good.
>
> Can you explain the symbolism of the cross in Evangelion?
>
> KT: There are a lot of giant robot shows in Japan, and we did want our story to have a religious theme to help distinguish us. Because Christianity is an uncommon religion in Japan we thought it would be mysterious. None of the staff who worked on Eva are Christians. There is no actual Christian meaning to the show, we just thought the visual symbols of Christianity look cool. If we had known the show would get distributed in the US and Europe we might have rethought that choice.

> "The question of what worked and what didn't therefore doesn't seem a pertinent one to me; to me the show is about dysfunctionality: of the artist, of his creation, and of his artistic attempts to phrase and portray that creation. If Evangelion "worked" it would be Gasaraki or Brain Powerd. Less flippantly, it might be Gundam or Getta Robo G. But what would have been the point of making them again?"
>
....
>
> "We've seen instances, from Anno in interviews, to the pseudo-exposes of Otaku no Video, to comments by people we know, that they eventually got tired of the grinding unreality of anime, which became quite as oppressive as the grinding reality they thought to escape by becoming an otaku. The problem with that explanation for me is that I don't believe one ever escapes from reality, the challenges of existence, the issues of having been born into this world: of being a human being.
>
> Rejecting the otaku and his works isn't going to teach you how to see, any more than the rigorous motions of otaku culture will make you go blind. Upon embarking upon his post-Eva project KareKano, Anno remarked as an epigram for the show that "reality has no mercy". He based his approach to the series in large part by talking to students in contemporary Japanese high schools: trying to restore the conversation he had cut off when he was their age."
>
> ... "The complaint may certainly have some validity within Gainax itself. Anno himself foresaw this in "What Were We Trying To Make Here?", when he said, "I know my behavior was thoughtless, troublesome and arrogant. But I tried. I don't know what the result will be, because I don't know where life is taking the staff of the production. I feel that I am being irresponsible. But it's only natural that we should synchronize ourselves with the world within the production." The synch rate wasn't always 100%. Masayuki, Kazuya Tsurumaki, and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto had their own ideas; Ikuto Yamashita, the man most responsible for the distinctive mechanical designs of Evangelion, had his detailed scenario for how the story should end (it would have involved the "emergence" of the Eva units).

<http://web.archive.org/web/20071103111305/www.cjas.org/~leng/hikiko.htm> "The current status of "otaku" and Japan's latest youth crisis"


> Much has been made of the fact that the sense of anger, disgust, and confusion pervasive to Studio Gainax's smash-hit series NEON GENESIS EVANGELION  wasn't something done simply to follow the tradition of anime's angst-filled robot jocks, but was rather a personal emotional confession of its director, Hideaki Anno. Not only did Anno frighten and shock new audiences when they glimpsed an intense, reflexive honesty anime creators rarely think (or, perhaps, think better than) to put on display, but towards those converted to hardcore fans, Anno displayed a sometime mocking attitude towards their obsessions and expectations for EVA (and as an otaku himself, this was of necessity also self-mockery). Horrified or vilified, it didn't matter?audiences ate it up with a soupline ladle, and EVANGELION became the greatest commercial success in Gainax's history.
>
> But Gainax had tried this once before, and it was their greatest commercial failure. It was a different time, 1991, and the approach was satire, not drama. Some have even gone as far to say it was the chilly reception of their forth production, 1991's OTAKU NO VIDEO, which ushered in the four-year absence of the studio from new anime ventures, broken spectacularly with EVANGELION. Actually a compilation of two videos released separately in Japan in that same year, OTAKU NO VIDEO 1982 and MORE OTAKU NO VIDEO 1985, AnimEigo's release of OTAKU NO VIDEO is a unique document in anime: Studio Gainax's confession of their feelings as obsessed fans, or "otaku" -- part satire, part autobiography, and part wish-fulfillment. OTAKU NO VIDEO's structure cuts back and forth between anime and live-action. The anime portion, with unforgettable character designs by Ken'ichi Sonoda (BUBBLEGUM CRISIS, GUNSMITH CATS), tells the story of Kubo, a clean-cut young university student who gets gradually sucked into the otaku lifestyle and, subsequently rejected by society, vows to become "Otaking," and attempts to "otakuize" the human race through building a mighty corporation that will sell "otaku culture" to the world. The live-action portions contain mocking, purported interviews with "real otaku" whose identities are concealed in the style of a tabloid-TV "true crime" show.

> ... But OTAKU NO VIDEO hardly bore an auspicious name as it sat on store racks. The name of Tsutomu Miyazaki -- a serial killer arrested in 1989 whose otaku background was exploited as a media circus (in a manner not unlike the live-action segments of ONV) -- was still fresh in the public mind, and made Gainax, to any potential mainstream audience, appear to be merely exposing a distasteful pathological subculture. Which, of course, is what they were, in fact doing, for the purpose of laying all their cards on the table. American anime fans are often concerned about the image the mainstream media may present of their devotion; in the light of such fears, ONV was a pre-emptive strike. The black-comedy truth is that any mainstream-media exposé could not possibly put otaku in a worse light than the one Gainax shines on itself. Yet ONV's satire also branches out to encompass the larger society, as it portrays scenes of "normal" people who would never fall prey to obsession and bad culture like an otaku, standing in line for hours to buy a designer-label sweatshirt or going to quality fare like a revival of KRAMER VS. KRAMER. And of course, respectable corporations in ONV are quite happy to take over and market the creations of otaku operating out of six-mat offices and give those same creators the old heave-ho.
>
> ... And Gainax was clearly out to bite the hand that fed them?the bent-over, twitching, hentai computer game-otaku, socially paralyzed, hiding from the sun, has got a card from Gainax's own NADIA on his PC-98, and is activating his manual hand release to Gainax's own dirty on-screen program, "Cybernetic High School." The contrast between ONV's anime portion -- upwardly-mobile, world-striding anime otaku designed by Sonoda, overcoming every setback to make their culture the culture of all mankind -- and the otaku of ONV's live-action portion -- stark, low-res, poorly lit, crudely obscured, and not likely to ever leave that room -- gave ONV  a schizophrenic quality that must have made it difficult for many hardcore fans to bear.

"It seems like all [older?] men see younger girls as better than anything else. I guess it's because of their age. They have this incredible energy which older men are lacking. In fact, there's no energy left in Japan."

> What is your usual day at work like?
>
>  'The production of anime is very hard, time-consuming work. There are times where there are more things to do, and times where there are less. During the production of Evangelion, I was only able to sleep six hours a night and spent the rest of the time working. I slept at the studio and only went home very rarely. Evangelion was an extreme case, I normally work twelve hours a day. '
>
>
> ...Does it surprise you that Evangelion, Nadia and OMG are considered "classics" in Germany? Do you occasionally hear of the reactions from Germany in Japan?
>
> 'I know that anime is very popular in America. I wasn't aware that this also applies to Europe by now. There is almost no information or feedback about fans in Europe. We get a lot more information from America.'
>
>
> How come that one Episode of Kare Kano was not produced with drawings, but with "paper figurines"? Wasn't that very laborious?
>
> 'This is something only Gainax could do, since it's very unusual to produce an episode in such a different fashion. At Gainax, we have people who like live action movies, Science Fiction and special effects, as well as others who simply want to produce ordinary anime. Another group likes to mix different stylistic elements, which was very apparent in Kare Kano. Hideaki Anno already used to produce "amateur animes" with special effects before he started working at Gainax.' [This is an understatement; Gainaxers were much more heavily involved in that sort of thing, see _The Notenki Memoirs_.]
>
>
> ...Ikari Gendo is a very controversial character. How do you see the role of Ikari Gendo in Evangelion?
>
> 'Ikari Gendo is not exactly popular in Japan. Many think that he is too stern with Shinji and that he generally exudes the aura of a hard, traditional, strict father. Gendo was meant to be a strong father who should have a positive influence on Shinji so that he could grow to be more confident and adult-like. [!] Many modern fathers in Japan are "mollycoddled" which was another reason to make Ikari Gendo into a strong father. '
>
>
> ...What meaning does the cross symbol hold in Evangelion?
>
> 'We didn't think that using this Christian symbol would lead to problems outside of Japan. In Japan, there were none. It's meant to make the series look more exotic and mysterious, there isn't any particular religious aspect to it. We thought that the mixture of science and religion would make the series more interesting.' [cf. Tsurumaki and Yamaga's other statements on this topic]
>
>
> ...Who killed Kaji? What's your version of it?
>
> 'This is a question that many Japanese fans also wonder about. Kaji wanted to investigate a deeper part of NERV (SEELE) and learn of its secrets. He was tricked by one of his informants and then killed. It wasn't Misato or Ritsuko.'[^killedkaji]
>
>
> ...Is the scooter in front of the Gainax shop really the vehicle from the FLCL ending?
>
> 'Yes, it's the Vespa from the ending, and it's mine. Alas, it cannot fly.'
>
>
> Why are the male protagonists in Gainax-animes often "whimps"?
>
> 'There are animes like Dragonball where the protagonists keep getting stronger and stronger, but we at Gainax tend to base the protagonists on Otakus, and that's why we can't make a story where the characters get stronger and stronger.'
>
> ...What do you think of Anime Music Videos that are often made by fans?
>
> 'I own a small broadcast station in Japan and I really like music videos. I don't have any problems with such videos - FLCL is already pretty close to a music clip, anyway.'
>
>
> Do you know the Fan-Video "Kodomo no EVA"? There are rumors that Gainax employees were involved with it.
>
> 'No, these were real Otakus, not Gainax employees.' (grins)

> "To be fair, Eva does seem to contain a host of personal symbols. It is said that the troubled relationship between Shinji and and his distant manipulative father is based on Anno's own childhood. But the lasting success of Evangelion seems to indicate that by somehow trying to create a very personal work, Anno wound up tapping into something very universal."

> [Miyamura:] At first I didn't... how do I put it? I've never played a role of a character like her, so I tried really hard to find ways to connect to her. By now, she's already become a part of me. Now, she's absolutely adorable. Um, now, she's the... girly part of me that I haven't been able to express before....My Asuka had a sad ending in the anime series, so I'm hoping for something different in this movie.
>
> ...[Sadamoto:] Having a necktie or not, even with the same white shirt, could change his [Shinji's] whole character. I drew him wearing a regular shirt, in just an ordinary school uniform so he seems like an average character.
>
> [On Misato] There's a character called Mine Fujiko in an old series called Lupin. And when I was young, I was... err... thought it was really interesting. She looked like she's still 20, but she also seemed like she's in her 30s. As for her bangs, well, I just stuck Usagi-chan's bangs on her. It started as a joke. But now having the voice actor, Mitsuishi-san and all, it's no longer a joke.
> [On Rei] One of my favorite bands is called the Buff Girl Team and in one of their songs, there's this line "a white girl in bandages." I had an image of her even before I started Evangelion. Like a girl with a dark past. I thought it'll be interesting to have a girl in bandages. And maybe she'll have the antibacterial smell like hospitals. If I had known her when I was 14, I would have hesitated to get close to her. She's cute, but her world's the farthest away from mine. But I end up admiring her. In the anime, I designed her as kind of an idol figure.
>
> [On Ritsuko] I got a rare request from Anno-san to make a hot girl. He wanted a sidekick girl for Nishimura Shinobu. He wanted her to be really girly, so I took that and added my own ideas to her. Matsushita Yuki-san in the drama "He's there when I turn around" is wearing... not a miniskirt, but hot pants under her white lab coat. That left a really strong impression on me, so I thought I'll try making Ritsuko wear a miniskirt under her lab coat.
>
> Not just with designing characters, but when I'm making a Gainax story, I can influence the story quite a bit. For example, this time, my most influential work was called... _Mind and Soul_, one of the shows on NHK. I got my themes from that, and I tried to convey my idea to the fans. When they ask me why are the main characters are only 14 year-olds, or why is it that only kids can ride in it, I actually didn't think of a reason why at first, so I got those ideas, and others, from that show.
>
> My very first characters were Gendo and Shinji. I made those two quite easily. I was aiming for a character that's both realistic and ordinary. I wanted a character that'll be hard for others to make.
>
> ...Q. What role does school play?
>
> [Assistant Director Tsurumaki Kazuya:] By having it pre-exist, it makes the story as a whole more cheerful... or rather... less serious. By inserting a school-setting, or a romantic comedy, like more teenager-like aspects, it makes it easier for the audience to connect to the story. But actually...parts of it have become like...a school anime, and other parts have...gone a bit off the original intent.
>
> [Hideaki Anno:] There are certain things that only work on a TV show. In the closed world of animation, there's a feeling of closure and suffocation among those who've been locked in together. Some people feel it, and others don't. At least I felt it. And you want to express that feeling somehow, but it's a little hard to do in movies. That's where you realize there are some things only TV can do.
> The main character this time is both an introvert and righteous. He also tends to categorize things. And those kinds of characters usually have something hidden. Like a way to escape from that closure. Not suicide though. Suicide is what's left after hope is gone. It's not loss of hope. Well, I don't think humans can lose hope. We might be living, trying to see what losing hope is like.
>
> So the question becomes, how can an introvert like him change? Well, all the characters are introverts by nature. Like they don't last long in team work. Their loose human relationships are reflected in the movie. Some people feel sympathy for them, and others might feel threatened by them. But we're prepared for that. Well, we expect that.
>
> "New Era" becomes "Neon Genesis" in English. The "Era" is translated using its alternate meaning. On the other hand, its Japanese counterpart has another meaning. This is done to express both meanings. The word doesn't look very good in Katakana, so we used English and Japanese to play on the pun. This comes from our desire to make something new from the anime.
>
> That's all.
>
> It means both the new era and the new genesis that marks that. That's what the title means.

> The main difference in the GAINAX of today compared to the past is stability in animation production. "For a dozen years or so, we just kept going without much planning," says Yamaga--it's the 'without much planning' part he wants to drop. "I guess we didn't really start thinking about how to run the company more effectively, like a company should be run, until maybe two or three years ago. Seriously." It's a matter of taking on work, defining the goals and checking to see if they're being fulfilled. "I mean, none of this is anything new," he remarks. "I guess normal people do it that way from the start."
>
> ...Of his thoughts regarding Evangelion, Yamaga replies, "Before then, we were aware that this thing called 'anime' was making waves, but it wasn't the kind of thing where famous personalities would get up on TV and say, 'I watch anime'--I doubt KimuTaku [Takuya Kimura of the group SMAP] would just suddenly go 'Evangelion!' you know." Yet he found the series was continually being mentioned and incorporated into TV drama material at the time. "From that point on, the distinction between 'someone who likes anime' and 'a normal person' began rapidly disappearing. That's the thing that impressed me the most."
>
> The series was not only a landmark in the industry and for GAINAX; financially speaking, it was the first anime production to actually make money for the company. "Not making money is one thing, but that doesn't mean they weren't hits," stresses Yamaga of their pre-Eva works.  "The others were certainly hits, but the contracts were at fault."
>
> "We never had very good contracts," he admits.  "In fact, we didn't have a very good contract for Evangelion, either, but it was just so popular. So basically we made money on the products we put out ourselves. They said on the news how Evangelion had passed the 30 billion yen mark, so even if the contract only gave us 1% of that, it's still be 300 million yen!"
>
> Until then, the games division kept GAINAX running. Yamaga recalls that Takami Akai, who'd been with the group since their college days, suddenly bought a computer and announced, "Let's do games! If we do games, we can make money."
>
> "According to him, at that time with Japanese computer games, the art was done by the programmers, so it totally sucked," Yamaga explains.  Since Akai was a painter, he'd be able to create decent images, even with the limit of 16 displayable colors at the time. "He was like, 'If we do this, there's no way we can go wrong!"
>
> Akai's concept was literally on the money. "Princess Maker (1991) was a big hit, and that paid our salaries for quite a while," Yamaga says on the princess raising simulation. "Unlike the anime and films, we make the games all in-house and sell some of them ourselves, so it's not just that we have the rights; we get to keep the take in those cases, so hit or no hit, the amount of money coming in is totally different."
>
> ...Highly anticipated by GAINAX fans is Yamaga's grand project, Aoki Uru, which some say is a sequel to Honneamise. Yamaga says there's nothing he can impart on its development just yet, though he assures us that the project is maturing and moving forward. It's tied in with how GAINAX will evolve, their position with respect to the industry and the position animation occupies within Japan.
>
> ...A regular US convention guest, he observes that compared to Japanese fans, overseas fans--especially the ones also studying Japanese--tend to approach anime intellectually, akin to how Japanese study European film or foreign literature. As an example, Yamaga mentions the dictionaries and reference books created by fans.  "It's such an academic atmosphere."
>
> ..."That debate's been going on for a long time, but we've gone along ignoring it, making things that target Japan, and they're still very popular overseas. Sen to Chihiro was an extremely 'Japanese' film, wasn't it? There were parts that even Japanese viewers couldn't understand without some research." He stresses the point with an analogy: "I really like French wine from Bordeaux, so do I want something that the businessmen over there have whipped up especially for Japanese? No--give me the stuff the French people like."
>
> ...Among the production materials on Hideaki Anno's desk is an area occupied by various toys from Thunderbirds, UFO, and Space: 1999. Anno is a big tokusatsu (special effects film) fan--he shot a live-action Ultraman parody on 8mm film during his student days--so it's not surprising to also spot a collection of the ultra heroes standing in formation, as well as a set of similarly arranged Kamen Rider figures. Although he hasn't been getting into recent movies and music, tokusatsu hero shows remain a favorite viewing of his. "I've been watching Kamen Rider 555 and AbaRanger," he says. When asked about the long-running Kamen Rider series' evolution over the years, Anno replies, "I haven't seen them all, but I think change is a good thing."
>
> The acclaimed director of anime has shifted gears in recent years, with credits that include two live-action films, Love and Pop and Shikijitsu, adaptations of novels by Ryu Murakami and Ayako Fujitani, respectively. While tight-lipped regarding details of a new live-action work he's currently directing, Anno says it's an action movie, due to wrap toward the end of the year. In the meantime, Shikijitsu is slated for DVD release this summer in Japan. "It's the story of a man and a woman meeting, and what happens during their one month together." Author Fujitani also stars as the lead, and director Shunji Iwai (of Swallowtail Butterfly fame) is also cast in the film.
>
> Anno believes that his first feature, Love and Pop, was visually very light in comparison. Shot on digital video with experimental camerawork and a documentary-like presentation, it depicts schoolgirl Hiromi's foray into the world of subsidized dating to acquire the funds for a much coveted ring.  "It didn't have any tricky elements to it or have a heavy feel," he states. "Following that up with something with the exact same feel would be boring. That's why on Shikijitsu, I tried to liven things up by using 35mm film and Cinescope, and by threading the images together in a visually appealing way. I wanted to shoot some really good-looking images."
>
> "The novels were interesting, but there was also the more realistic aspect of it: that I could do this," Anno says of the factors that drew him to develop the novels for the screen. He didn't know how much money he'd be able to round up, but believed the projects could be realized with relatively small budgets.  "I assembled a staff of very talented individuals, from one person who did a couple of films out of his own pocket when he was at university, to another who's an incredibly gifted producer. I think that's why, even though I was heading into uncharted territory, I was able to make the transition from anime director to live-action, and make movies with a minimum of problems."
>
> Comparing the two mediums, he remarks that live action offers more freedom. "Anime is an altogether different story; you have to create the visuals in order to move ahead. With live-action, you can end up with visuals that you hadn't expected, or that are different from those you'd imagined. Actually, the part about live-action that I liked was that it didn't turn out as I'd planned." We comment that Love and Pop seems to exude spontaneity from the cast's performance to the camera work, freed from the rigidity of anime once the storyboards have been set. Anno agrees. "It was all about that."
>
> He suggests that budding live-action filmmakers should reference both anime and live-action works and incorporate the best of both worlds. Indeed, anime-inspired shot compositions lend a unique feel to Love and Pop's visuals.
>
> ...Regarding his other early works, we mention a 1991 Japanese interview with manga artist Kazuhiko Shimamoto, in which Anno remarked that when he saw Nadia in its entirety, he was sad because he felt it was too geared toward children.
>
> I don't think it was 'sad'" he clarifies. "The nuance was a little different when translated into English. NHK's vision for Nadia was very, very strong. I was able to do what I wanted within that vision, but I couldn't change the basic parts. I was able to do a lot of the things I wanted to do, but I couldn't do everything that I'd really wanted to do. Which, I think, gave it the nuance of being a more child-oriented work. And that's why, even though I did everything I possibly could, Nadia is a work that I still have regrets about. I wonder if that's the nuance that came across in English."
>
> ...Then there's Oruchuban Ebichu, a hilariously perverted series brimming with dialogue (mostly from its diminutive star) and containing situations unprintable in this publication, There's a misconception that Kotono Mitsuishi (Misato's voice actress) originally brought the manga to Anno's attention during the production of Evangelion, which led to him planning the anime adaptation--it was actually another friend who introduced him to the work.
>
> ...The same friend introduced Anno to the Kareshi Kanojo no Jijo ("His and Her Circumstances") manga. When we comment on its deft balance between comedy, personal struggle and drama, he replies, "I didn't really care much about the underlying struggle; the comedy was what was interesting.  The story relied on comedy as its base, and it was very east to turn the atmosphere of the original into the anime."
>
> ..."Now, seven years later, the show has been a hit, so they gave us a bit of money and time [for the Renewal remix of _NGE_. Both the picture and sound are radically different.  Different, but also the same as was present in the original." The extra audio channels courtesy of Dolby Digital 5.1 opened up new sonic avenues. "It's a remix, with us fixing parts where the sound wasn't good enough before," he comments. "We fixed over 100 parts of the picture." The remaster boasts sharper, jitter-free visuals with intensified colors; the enhanced audio is palpable as soon as the opening song fires up, when percussion elements and back-up vocals are introduced via the surround speakers in an enveloping effect. Action scenes give subwoofers a noticeably increased workout.

## 2003 S

> "...This is the opening for EVANGELION: DEATH and an introductory part of Bach's unaccompanied cello suite #1 played by a boy who looked just like Shinji.
>
> ...This BGM was played also when the Strategic Self Defense Forces attack the NERV HQ. The established ferocious image of the BGM actually emphasizes that the enemy for humans are other humans. [cf. _Blue Christmas_, _Battle for Okinawa_]
>
> ...As the title ["The Beast"] indicates, this song is used mainly in the scenes where the EVA unit goes out of control just like a beast. [Not an Antichrist reference]
>
> ...The coordination of the song was done by the executive producer, Mr. Toshimichi Ohtsuki (however, his name is not on the credits in the film). He requested to change the streaming melody into a crispy notching style in the demo stage. To support the atmosphere aimed by Mr. Ohtsuki for the opening direction, the anime staff pushed themselves with rapidly changing edits which reflect their amazing efforts and good sense. As per Director Anno's request, we cut out the male chorus in order to emphasize maternal affection for the opening song.
>
> ...This one ["Asuka Strikes!"] is also a cheerful song with the country style to bring out the charming point of Asuka's unyielding spirit. Further, ASUKA'S THEME was played for Rei's appearance scene as a transfer student in the World of Possibility, the last episode of the TV series, and MISATO'S THEME was played when Asuka was introduced as Shinji's childhood friend. I wonder if these are also an audio indicator for giving the suggestion of "another possibility."
>
> ...The production of DEATH and REBIRTH was announced and was supposed to be a brand new story for the final episode; however, the concept of the story got so big that the real final episode was carried over to that summer. And it was decided in haste that the middle of episode 25, AIR was drawn instead. Although such a fact was already announced prior to the opening, loud stirring noises were echoed in the theater when the beginning of the song started playing in the scene with the EVA series. The world of the endless summer that was described in EVANGELION is the season of incidents that lets a boy grow or the season that has a lot of homework in store. So it's no coincidence that the final episode was released in summer. [gatotsu911: Is he implying that the film was deliberately held back to get a summer release?? Oh Anno, you rascal!]
>
> ...21. Expansion of Blockage
>
> This is the most amazing BGM that is played dramatically throughout the TV series and the movies. It is no less than impressive that throughout this nearly 7 minute long BGM the pictures are perfectly in synch. Director Anno previously made a comment that he wanted to "break down the blockage" in his TV anime making. He thinks that one of the reasons EVANGELION had such a huge success is that this blockage that he talked about synchronized with general society's own blockage. Apparently this series jumped out from the frame of anime and became the EVANGELION boom; however, it's not like it was delivered to society. More or less society stepped into the world of EVANGELION...? In contrast to the more open visual scenes (set aside either from self-ridicule or sarcasm), it is a title that consciously expresses something.
>
> 22. THE HEADY FEELING OF FREEDOM (OP Strings)
>
> Although it came to such a climax when Episode 24 of EVANGELION was aired on TV, none of the mysteries were solved in the last show, Episode 25 [Sic]. Due to the consistent effort to portray an avant-grade, play-like depiction using experimental techniques, fans' shock and confusion were not measurable. It was just like Shinji would say, "You have betrayed me!" However if you watch AIR and SINCERELY YOURS along with the last two episodes from the TV series, you'll realize their stories have common story lines although their expression methods are different from each other. Coincidentally, we have put together Track 21 and 22's strings, and Track 23 and 24's piano's beginnings and endings which are naturally connected to make a suite from the last two songs from the TV series and movies.
>
> 23. Good, or Don't Be. (OP - 2D type)
>
> Generally an in instrumentally arranged opening theme is used very often in the film as a BGM, but in EVANGELION, only previously mentioned Track 22 and this one are used in the final episode. Therefore, this song would have become a suitable song to decorate the finale with such a sense of accomplishment. The TV series ended with the impact of destroying a stereotype that in an anime's final episode everything had to be settled.
>
> 24. Opening of a Dream (Piano - Leave It To Version)
>
> Shinji's independence that he bid farewell to his mother and chose to live in the world of others despite the fact that he would hurt others is portrayed in this song with a somewhat sad piano solo. It is as if it suggested the relationship between the project of EVANGELION and audiences.
>
> [Komm, Süsser Tod / Come, Sweet Death]...Opposite from the rhythmical arrangement, Director Anno's lyrics have a sense of heartrending sorrow. MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM III ENCOUNTER IN SPACE ('82) is a project which used the song written by the general director in the crucial scene of the final version.
>
> ...This CD concludes with this phantom song that we once planned to use as "one other possibility" along with Track 25. By the way, during the production of this album, we received news that Hollywood will shoot EVANGELION as a live action film. Who will play each character?

- _Neon Genesis Evangelion 2_

- [Classified Information](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Classified_Information_%28Translation%29); [Newtype USA](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=237672#237672) says NGE2 draws on 10 hours of interviews with Anno, but it's unclear what of the CI is straight from Anno and what is from the game-makers; see the [forum debates](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?t=4534) on canonicity.
     - [Kaworu's Good Ending](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=341191#341191) includes considerable background not included in the CI; but as this is just one possible ending, it's probably even less canon than the CI...

> Mr. Anno ("Evangelion") apparently never read the Bible, despite the heavy Christian symbology of his work; he just (according to Mr. Okada) picked out a few interesting technical terms. Likewise, the anime creation staff might open a book on psychology and, rather than read it thoroughly, simply go through it picking out "great technical terms" to use in the anime!
>
> ... How have otaku in Japan changed in the past 20 years due to the influence of computers? Mr. Okada said that, in the past 10 years, otakus have seen less and less of a need to hide their otakuness. But more than this, the Internet helps them connect with other otakus and make friends. However, a drawback is that they no longer sit under tremendous pressure - the dual pressure of loving anime and of yet having no outlet. The dual pressure often led to the person going out and doing something, but now, the fact they have outlets means they don't have the pressure pushing them to action any more.

> Secondly, the job demands dedication. Mr. Leiji Matsumoto, creator of "Captain Harlock" and "Galaxy Express 999," apparently was talking with Mr. Okada and Mr. Hideaki Anno at one point, and remarked: "Any man that takes more than four baths in a year cannot do anything truly great!" The idea: a person who truly devotes himself heart and soul to a project won't have the time or inclination to bathe for months on end. But the truly shocking part of the story was that Mr. Anno, standing next to Mr. Okada, was nodding and making noises of agreement!
>
> ... "Daicon IV" was deliberately made to be the same length and cel count as "Daicon III" - however, its particular theme was slightly darker, along the lines of destroy the old to create the new. It also played with the fun of half-losing one's sanity - the semi-insanity necessary to devote oneself to anime.
>
> For example, an audience member happened to ask about the "GAINAX bounce," a characteristic jiggling of the female cartoon character's breasts. This was apparently introduced in "Daicon IV" by Mr. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who added in the margin of the animation instructions: "Make this scene a little erotic (H)." The animation industry reacted with shock to this animation ("Is it OK to do this kind of thing?") and of course the technique was promptly adopted by other animation houses, including Cream Lemon's porn features.
>
> With "Evangelion," Mr. Okada said the animators were not quite confident about it, so they ran a manga 4 months before, both to garner some popularity as well as increase the odds of funding.

> Regarding that interview segment, the onscreen text listed him as "Shon Hernandez". According to the Otaku no Video liner notes, that's a reference to Shon Howell and Lea Hernandez, "who, together with Craig York (the real person in this segment), were the core of General Products USA."
>
> I read an interesting interview with Lea Hernandez where she talks about Craig York being filmed for Otaku no Video.
>
> ... At Fanimecon 2003, Gainax-member Hiroki Sato mentioned that he was one of the Otaku no Video interviewees, and that unlike the other interviews which required some setup time, they just came to his home and starting filming. My best guess is that he was the garage kit otaku, who was listed as "Sato Hiroshi (pseudonym)". If that was him, he had quite a place ^_^;

> 'interviewer: "Being a know-it-all..."

> Anno: Yes. Escapism is a "medium"\*, among other things. From behind reality, there's a refuge when it comes to "equipment". Sort of like winning a girl's heart, it looks unpleasant. During the time we shouldered the film (97 was when it played in theaters) originally such plans were transparent. Audiences were doused with water\*\* right away, something that enlightened them and made them want to go home. That's the sort of thing I wanted it to be. And so, I picked up on that "service".\*\*\*
>
> Anno: I think audiences picked up on a good thing. They continue to stay within their comfort zones, but I also think that one service in Eva's case is it was already a hopeless atmosphere.
>
> Anno: At least becoming enlightened seems to give a motive that it's necessary to do something... That good thing seems to be what audiences say; the conclusion developed from that sort of thing. I can confidently say I picked up on such "service".
>
> Notes:
>
> \*This term was used in EoE. Best example comes from EoE's Theatrical booklet: "[Medium (YORISHIRO)] An object which attracts divine spirits (= souls) or which acts as a media through which these spirits manifest themselves. In episode 26', Fuyutsuki refers to Eva-01 as a "Medium" (Well of Souls) when SEELE uses it to create the Tree of Life."
>
> \*\*Purification ritual, akin to baptism that is performed before material arts and such. Because it sounds similar to "being hit with a bucket of cold water", perhaps Anno is referring to how the start of EoE shocked audiences right away with the masturbation scene...
>
> \*\*\*Anno seems to mean fan-service as well as a general kind of "service" (favor/action) being performed for somebody else.

> Hour: Why did you decide to direct the movie version of this anime? Were you a fan of Cutie Honey when you were younger? What did it mean to you?
>
> Hideaki Anno: As a child I was a fan of the original author, Mr. Go Nagai....
>
> Hour: What inspired you in making _Cutie Honey_ in terms of its retro feel?
>
> Anno: Since the original was created in the '70s, I valued the original image. I think that the '60s and '70s were a time when energy was full of people, for Japan. Therefore, I thought that I wanted a spectator to remember the vitality of the time. I myself like the design line of the time, and think that it is more interesting than a present-day one. And I reflected it in the movie.
>
> ...
>
> Hour: What do you think is the message of _Cutie Honey_, or is it just about a pretty girl called Cutie Honey?
>
> Anno: Strong will which responds to reality and makes a living. And power of surviving life.


> "I wanted to say, ‘Don't run into the virtual world of fiction, but live in an actual life,'" says Anno in an e-mail interview with the Mirror.
>
> ...He also earned a reputation as one of the most "controversial" filmmakers in Japan, and reporters accused him of being defensive and antagonistic at press conferences when asked about his followers' reactions. He seems to have come to terms with negative feedback since then.
>
> "A work is also a fan's thing, from when it is released," says Anno. "I think that they are free to react how they choose. However, I have recognized that there are many of those who judge people with insufficient sensitivity."
>
> Although Anno went on record admitting he liked the ending of his series, out of respect to his co-workers on the set, he buzzed off all his hair, which he says is an ancient Japanese custom that expresses remorse and taking responsibility for one's actions.
>
> "I shaved my head because the TV series was not completed in its original image," he says. "My feeling of apologia was to the staff and the cast."

> "Recent remarks by Gendo and Fuyutsuki of NERV seem intriguingly to confirm that certain details of the Angels differ in this version of events. Although the first Angel to appear, Sachiel [in Stages 1-5], had been previously assumed to be the Third Angel as so coded in the anime, it is now suggested that in this version of events it was actually the Second. Fuyutsuki commented that the Angel Sahaquiel [Stage 30]--the Tenth Angel as coded in the anime--was actually "[number] seven," to which Gendo replied, "Yes. And five remain." According to this differing classification, then, the Third Angel would be Shamshel [Stages 9-10], the Fourth, Ramiel [Stages 15-19], the Fifth, Gaghiel [Stage 20], and the Sixth, Israfel [Stage 22-26]. Note that the Angels Sandalphon and Matarael--the Eighth and Ninth respectively--have not appeared in this version of events, as they did in the anime where they followed Israfel and preceded Sahaquiel."

> Over the next year, I watched the series numerous times, read every explanation I could find, combed fan sites, forums, anything I could take in to understand the ending.   I don't think it was until  I spoke with Matt Greenfield at a panel at Otakon 2001 that I finally understood.  I rewatched the show, and it all made a newfound sense.  The catharsis, the introspection, it all resonated within myself.  I cannot say when it began, but it was an epiphany that would become more and more apparent and integral within myself.  I felt very much like Shinji at the very end of the series a little more each day.  My depression faded, the apathy waned, and I began to find a respect for myself.

> "Well. I think that the world of animation is cyclic and has not evolved much for 20 years. At the time, the large madness was around Zeta Gundam, and 20 years later, Gundam is in the news and very popular. With regard to Newtype, I will say that you do not have to be concerned. As long as there will be series of popular animation, the magazine will continue to exist. However, I think that the industry rests too much on large successes like Gundam, which you could call the "Old Type," which is a little annoying with a magazine which is called Newtype. As I said earlier, the world of animation follows a regular cycle. The cover of the 10th anniversary issue was Evangelion, the cover of 20th is Gundam-- thus it is logical that the cover of the 30th will again be Evangelion. You'd better reserve it as of now."

> [Miyamura:] "I had been thinking directors should convey their ideal how the show shold be to us. But Anno pitches us questions such as "What do you think for yourself if things went on such and such ways to you?" After recording all lines of the movie, I was called to the studio because the final line needed to be revised. Ogata came there too as it was Asuka and Shinji's scene. Asuka's final line was "Anta nankani korosareru nowa mappira yo!" in the film scenario. Anno didn't live with my line no matter how many times I tried. Ogata and I were at a loss how we should play what Anno wanted to express; she even tried to ride on me and choke me to meet his demand. He must have been pursuing reality. Concerning the final line we adopted, I'm not sure whether I should say about it in fact. At last Anno asked me "Miyamura, just imagine you are sleeping in your bed and a stranger sneaks into your room. He can rape you anytime as you are asleep but he doesn't. Instead, he masturbates looking at you, when you wake up and know what he did to you. What do you think you would say?" I had been thinking he was a strange man, but at that moment I felt disgusting. So I told him that I thought "Disgusting". And then he sighed and said "... thought as much." He said. " I thought as much. "

> "If in the room where Miyamura was sleeping, when you were sleeping by yourself in your own room, through the window came a man whom you did not know. And moreover you still did not notice it and kept sleeping, and although it was a situation where you could be attacked at any moment, you were not attacked. He just looked at where I was sleeping, and although it was not really the scene of Shinji just before, he masturbated and when he was done you woke up. How about that?"

> "When I first met Anno in college...the first thing he told me was how he knew every line in SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO, except for the first episode, and the reason he didn't know every line in the first episode was because he didn't record it, and the reason he didn't record it was because he didn't know if the series would turn out to be any good...What you saw in OTAKU NO VIDEO is pretty much what happened."

These are not firm plans, but more an early draft for a potential project.  Now before any fanboys start gushing, let me emphasize again that this is just one of many project proposals and drafts that Gainax has drawn up, and even though it would be a guaranteed money maker (albeit on a much lesser scale than Eva itself), it may still never get made.  At present it is just one of many ideas.

> Today it's common for anime to be made specifically for and about otaku (COSPLAY COMPLEX, COMIC PARTY, GENSHIKEN), but Gainax, being the original gangstas, did it first. Compared to such recent titles, OTAKU NO VIDEO is both more idealistic and more insulting about being an otaku; ONV keeps cutting between the anime segments, where the young members of Gainax (called "Grand Prix" or "Giant X" in ONV) boast that they will "otakuize" the world, and live-action interviews with pathetic, ashamed, and anti-social otaku in reality. Both images, as far as Gainax was concerned, were, of course, true.'

> '"Twelve years is enough time for you to be able to look back on earlier works objectively", he explains. "Shortly before we started this project, Anno had a big Eva marathon where he watched the whole series in one go.
>
> The first thing he said when he finished watching was, 'This show really is interesting, isn't it? I never realized how interesting it was'. That comment really shook me."'
>
> ...  "Everyone was completely burned out during the second half of the original TV run and the movies, but now they're fresh and enthusiastic again. They've gotten older, but they're still full of energy. It's almost like watching kids prepare for a holiday celebration. The staff will also include a bunch of younger twenty-somethings who decided to join the anime industry after watching Eva and being inspired. " [Otsuki?]
>
> ... "It's true that Eva was a huge hit," Otsuki says. "But its success spawned a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding in the in the industry, the end result being a bunch of mass-produced junk. That mindset has persisted for ten years, but now we're in a position to prove it wrong. We're determined to close the door on the post-Eva era for good.
>
> ..."The new story takes place in the same period as the 1995 TV series, but the plot is completely different," producer Toshimichi Otsuki elaborates. "This isn't a remake or a quick fix. It's a totally new production."
>
> ..."It'll be something viewers can enjoy if they've never seen the TV series," Otsuki continues. "I want everyone--from hardcore fans of the original work to people who only know it because of the licensed stuff--to look at it as a standalone film series.
>
> The complexity has been somewhat lessened to make it more accessible to newbies, but it'll still take a bit of thought to understand." Otsuki adds that they're removing much of the deliberate obfuscation that made Eva infamous: "Filling works with difficult words and concepts in order to create confusion among viewers was a good technique 12 years ago, but not anymore, and one of our primary goals for this project is to turn everyone's expectations upside down."
>
> The core creative team from the TV series has reunited, with original director Hideaki Anno (Gunbuster) overseeing the production. Kazuya Tsurumaki (FLCL) is taking on the mechanical design. Anno himself came up with the storyline for the first installment, while fellow GAINAX co-founder Shinji Higuchi is responsible for storyboarding. A number of new staff members will also be brought on as the production advances.

>
> "I mustn't run away," a line Shinji mutters repeatedly to himself in Episode One, would become a mantra that summed up the entire Evangelion series in Japan.
>
> Until Evangelion, anime had ignored concepts such as having an ordinary person piloting such an elaborate and powerful machine as the Eva. (What?)
>
> "We had to think deeply about how we were going to present Shinji. And because we were thinking along these lines, we set our minds on the idea that the entire series would largely focus on how Shinji deals with things going on inside himself," Gainax's Sato recalls.
>
> ...Sato sees Episode 16 was of particular importance. A spherical black Angel called Ririeru (Leliel in English) appears and Shinji's Eva Unit 01 is absorbed into it.
>
> Normally, such close contact between an Evangelion and an Angel would have resulted in combat. Instead, in this episode, Shinji is confronted by another version of himself.
>
> The two Shinjis engage in conversation as the young boy probes "himself" about who he really is and the meaning of "self."
>
> The episode clearly shows how Shinji explores his inner self as he continues asking why it is that he has been selected to pilot the Eva.
>
> The series continues in this way with a strong focus on Shinji's internal struggles until Evangelion draws toward its climax.
>
> A controversial ending In Episode 24, Evangelion took a major change of focus with the appearance of an Angel called Kaworu.
>
> Kaworu was almost indistinguishable from an average human, which allowed the Angel to get close to Shinji and eventually befriend him before they being forced to take opposing sides in battle.
>
> Their fight scene is conducted with Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony" playing in the background and the intensity of the battle with a foe that should represent the final enemy seemed to be setting up an appropriate ending to be carried out over the series' final two installments.
>
> ...When Episode 25 first aired the following week, nearly all viewers felt betrayed.
>
> The story did not develop at all and focused almost entirely on what was going on inside Shinji, a plotline that had been pursued numerous times in the past.
>
> Episode 26, the final show of the series, was much the same as it explored the thoughts of Shinji and two other major characters, Asuka and Misato.
>
> The TV series ended with people gathered around Shinji, praising him for saving them and the young boy finally realizing that he belonged in the world and apparently feeling at ease.
>
> Some people claimed the convoluted ending to the series came about because the production team had been unable to make deadlines, or that the team was too concerned about the movie version of Evangelion that was due to hit theaters shortly after.
>
> Anno never clearly spoke out about the final two episodes and why they were made the way they came out.
>
> Bitter disputes broke out on online bulletin boards, with some critical of the producers for failing to provide a clear-cut end to the story, and others who praised the finish for being "typically Evangelion-like."
>
> But when commentator Eiji Otsuka sent a letter to the _Yomiuri Shimbun_, complaining about the end of the Evangelion series, the debate went nationwide.
>
> "The debate that erupted over the ending went way beyond our calculations," Gainax's Sato chuckles. "Anno probably knew what was going on. He realized that media other than anime had taken notice of Evangelion."
>
> Otsuki, the show's producer and a close collaborator with Anno, agrees. "Anno loved it when the media wanted to report on him.

> "...Distinguished less by the quality of its animation than by its dark subject matter, nonlinear storytelling, and heavy, depressive stoner vibe, the series is regularly praised by animators, novelists, cultural theorists, and visual artists as the flower of Japanese pop culture. It has been credited with defining gender roles, influencing attitudes toward the environment, and spawning the madly obsessive — and immensely profitable — otaku subculture embraced by tens of thousands of geeky fans who spend their lives unraveling the larger message of the show and collecting pornographic comic books featuring the show's female characters.
>
> In person, Hideaki Anno, dressed in a military-green jumpsuit and black boots, slouches deep in his battered office couch and glowers. In a country where conformity is still a virtue, Anno stands out on account of his curly black hair and large, cauliflower-shaped ears, which, in combination with his jumpsuit, give him the appearance of an angry hobbit in black-rimmed glasses. Before creating his famous anime, Anno went through a four-yearlong depression, during which he did no work and spent most of his time alone in his room. In 2003, Gainax sold the live-action rights to Neon Genesis Evangelion to a film producer that is collaborating with Weta Workshop, a company whose principals include Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson. I am particularly interested in talking to Anno about the character of Rei, a depressive, suicidal girl whose big eyes, girlish body, and blank expression have been the model for the central female characters in Japanese anime for the past decade.
>
> "Rei is someone who is aware of the fact that even if she dies, there'll be another to replace her, so she doesn't value her life very highly," Anno explains, slouching ever-deeper into the couch. "Her presence, her existence — ostensible existence — is ephemeral. She's a very sad girl. She only has the barest minimum of what she needs to have. She's damaged in some way; she hurts herself. She doesn't need friends."
>
> Anno understands the Japanese national attraction to characters like Rei as the product of a stunted imaginative landscape born of Japan's defeat in the Second World War. "Japan lost the war to the Americans," he explains, seeming interested in his own words for the first time during our interview. "Since that time, the education we received is not one that creates adults. Even for us, people in their 40s, and for the generation older than me, in their 50s and 60s, there's no reasonable model of what an adult should be like." The theory that Japan's defeat stripped the country of its independence and led to the creation of a nation of permanent children, weaklings forced to live under the protection of the American Big Daddy, is widely shared by artists and intellectuals in Japan. It is also a staple of popular cartoons, many of which feature a well-meaning government that turns out to be a facade concealing sinister and more powerful forces.
>
> Anno pauses for a moment, and gives a dark-browed stare out the window. "I don't see any adults here in Japan," he says, with a shrug. "The fact that you see salarymen reading manga and pornography on the trains and being unafraid, unashamed or anything, is something you wouldn't have seen 30 years ago, with people who grew up under a different system of government. They would have been far too embarrassed to open a book of cartoons or dirty pictures on a train. But that's what we have now in Japan. We are a country of children.""

> "While Tsurumaki freely admits that the first of the four film installments--slated to hit theaters in Japan sometime mid-2007--will run like a digest of the TV series, employing key scenes to bring viewers up to speed on the basic story and setting, no one is very willing to speculate on the content of the second, third, or final films.
>
> "Frankly, it just got too chaotic," Tsurumaki comments on the brainstorming sessions that were initially meant to provide an overall plot outline and final resolution to the story. "We're all working from the assumption that we weren't able to reach our destination with the original TV series, but the exact nature of that "destination" is still unclear to everyone on the staff. Since we're going to all the trouble of making these new productions, we'd at least like to take the story as far as we took it back then, but it's been an uphill struggle so far. I get the feeling this project is going to be a very unstable project--in a lot of ways."

> "The running out of cash thing isn't true - that's something that's become a popular theory more recently, which confuses me a bit because at the time, there was absolutely no debate over what happened to the final episodes. In fact, it was reported in Japanese newspapers at the time - it was quite a big news story, given Eva's huge popularity in its original terrestrial broadcasts.
>
> Anno and the rest of the Gainax team had been pushing production of the various episodes up closer and closer to the deadlines issued by their TV station, to the extent that they were actually biking episodes over to the broadcast centre on Beta tape only minutes before the broadcast time. This was tolerated, because Eva had some of the highest ratings of any show ever - until Episode 24.
>
> Episode 24 arrived at the station so late that it couldn't even be watched before being broadcast - it was slapped in a Beta drive and transmitted directly, without being reviewed by any staff at the station. Episode 24, you'll recall, is the Kaworu episode, which aside from the homosexual overtones (probably not actually an issue), ends with, er, a pop :) Bear in mind that this was broadcast in a 6.30pm weekday slot on Japanese national television.
>
> The network went apeshit - it may have been in silhouette, and he may have been technically non-human, but you can't show a 14 year old popping his 14 year old friend's head off at 6.30pm on TV, even in Japan. Gainax, and Anno specifically, were accused of deliberately holding back the episode to prevent the network from seeing it before broadcast - and the network staff demanded to see the storyboards for the next two episodes.
>
> Since the storyboards they were then shown were the two episodes which ended up in EoE, it's no surprise that the network execs told Gainax that they were having a bleedin' bubble, and insisted (with seven days to go!) that they make new episodes instead. Hence the original episode 25 and 26; all re-used footage, with a few random bits and bobs of footage that had been animated for other purposes or cut from earlier episodes, and a few frames of new footage. 25 and 26 were the "fuck you" episodes, absolute nonsense thrown together on an incredibly short schedule after they were told that the original planned episodes wouldn't be screened.
>
> (I think that the theories about Gainax running out of cash may be down to people getting confused over some other facts about the studio - Gainax DID run into major financial trouble, but this was several years after Eva was released. In fact, the trouble was down to the fact that they hadn't paid their taxes on a lot of the money they made from Eva, and the fines levied by the government as a result almost bankrupted the company...)"

The Internet has made it so easy to zero in on others with your own interests that we've raised a generation of nerds mired in their own tiny spheres of influence.

[No, we always hope that our work is successful and appreciated by many.] On m'avait demandé de faire un personnage assez sombre. [I was asked to make a rather bleak person.] A vrai dire ce personnage a été inspiré d'une chanson assez populaire au japon qui parle d'une jeune fille toujours entouré de bandelette.

> "How did you come up with the idea for Gurren Lagann?"
>
> The answer: Toys. Yamaga-san seemed happy to answer this one. I'm paraphrasing the answer. He was quicker than what I could write down. He said that he met with a business contact who asked him, "Do we make a Gundam-like animation?" The contact continued, "Gundam is awesome, appeals to little kids and old school fans, and it can alternate between the two audiences easily." Yamaga-san then pointed out that another company is responsible for Gundam and continued that this person was an earnest person and took the advice seriously. He then later ran into a president of a toy company who told him that "Giant robots are eternal. They never go away."
> "Being a creator, I took it as a challenge. Trying to make a robot show that appeals to kids and adults."...The two GAINAX guys did talk briefly about their other giant robot show and how they wanted Gurren Lagann to be different from that one. What is interesting is that they came up with the basic mecha concept and the name, but most of filling out the story was left to the director and the scriptwriter.
>
> ...The next question concerned the sixth episode, and if GAINAX drew inspiration from their older work. "We are GAINAX. We will parody ourselves." (Bandai later clarified that the TV version of the sixth episode will be shown on Sci-Fi, but the DVDs will have the DVD version or maybe both versions.) A big part of why they had two episode sixes was that they had a hard time with the Japanese censors. It was not because they were running late or whatever.
>
> After that, a question about GAINAX's financials that was answered with "We walk a tightrope of bankruptcy and lowering our animator's wages." (Note: most of the animators were in the audience.) "We don't do more than 26 episode series because we'll go bankrupt."
>
> ...Keeping with the naming question, how did they come up with the name, "Gurren Lagann"? "'Gurren Lagann' sounds Japanese and foreign, so that was good. Honestly, the meeting to decide the name lasted three minutes."
>
> ...Next question was "Why did it start airing on Sunday morning? Wouldn't afternoon be a better time?" The panel (don't remember who, my notes only said, "ZOMG, cute Nia cosplayer in the third row.") answered that Sunday morning is actually the new primetime for anime. They said that a few years ago, the weekend afternoons were great for anime, but now it has shifted that Sunday morning is where the ratings are at. They aimed Gurren Lagann for that time slot, and they had to deal with more censors or something to that effect. My notes aren't clear…
>
> ...After that was a question on the large faced mecha design… "Director's idea to do robots with large faces. Because it is strange, we do it."
>
> ...Then I got to ask my second and final question, "Are Simon and Kamina apologies for Shinji Ikari?" Brought the room down with laughter as well as a face palm from a few panelists. Yamaga defiantly said, "What do you mean apology? Why does we have to apologize? Shinji is a great character." He seemed like he meant it.


> 1. Whose idea was the new Evangelion movie series project, and how did it come to be?
>
> The project came to be through director [Hideaki] Anno. All I know is after he developed the concept, he pulled together the team of which I am a part.
>
> ...6. Was it hard getting the original cast from the TV series together to do the films?
>
> This is something that I wasn't involved with, but it seems that the director was able to just pick up the phone and everyone flocked back.
>
> 7. Without spoiling anything, what are some of the differences fans can expect to see between the original TV series and the upcoming movie series?
>
> There's quite a bit of new visuals, some new designs, the coloring has been updated. Because we recorded the voice overs first, we were able to get a different sort of expression from the voice actors. There will be new plots and new stories involved as well. It's a brilliant work and I hope fans will really enjoy it.
>
> 8. What was the hardest thing about making the films?
>
> I wouldn't say that there were any real obstacles or anything difficult; it was quite the opposite because the original Evangelion was such a huge hit in Japan that many of the staff in the intervening time have become the top of their fields within animation, so to be able to work with the top people in animation was an incredible opportunity, and I don't remember any true difficulties.

> Interviewer: Mr. Nishizaki, how did Yamato production start?
>
> Nishizaki: At first I hit on the idea of a flying battleship. There was a prototype of this in a magazine called Boy's Club at the time. The ideas coalesced into Space Battleship Yamato. It began 34 years ago, in 1974. Anno, when did you first see it?
>
> Anno: I was an eighth-grader. I was already a fan of battleships, but when I saw the anime it was unprecedented. At the time, though, we didn't say 'anime,' it was 'TV manga.' I was fascinated just by the opening title. It was something adults would not be embarrassed to watch.
>
> I did 'missionary work' for Yamato at my school. I drew my own poster and put it up on the campus to spread the word! (Laughs)
>
> Nishizaki: The staff and I were very particular about making it as photographic as possible. If we could find anyone who could describe a real battleship I'd say 'I'll be there in 30 minutes," and jump in my car.
>
> However, our ratings were bad. We had planned to do 39 episodes, but we were reduced to 26. Heidi of the Alps was on another channel, and that was everyone's popular pick.
>
> Anno: A whole family would watch Heidi together. But as for Yamato, it was just me (laughs). But my father was soon tempted, too. After all, it was a program adults could enjoy.
>
> The first episode was a big surprise, and I became an instant fan. When the 2nd episode came on, I put my cassette recorder next to the TV. I noisily begged my parents for one to help with English study. After listening three times I could repeat all the dialogue (laughs)!
>
> Nishizaki: The sound effects were very good. Which did you like best?
>
> Anno: The main guns firing. In fact, we used that sound in Nadia and the Secret of Blue Water. Those sounds should be preserved for posterity!
>
> Interviewer: By the way, did you actually use that cassette recorder for English study?
>
> Anno: (Laughs) No, only for recording Yamato! I also recorded the commercials. I can recall all the catchphrases even today.
>
> Nishizaki: Was Yamato the model for Nadia?
>
> Anno: Your favorite works are always your model, whether or not you admit it. But Yamato's influence was large, especially on the spaceships.
>
> ...Interviewer: Nishizaki's dynamic connection! By the way, there is a rumor that Dessler was modeled after you. Is that true?
>
> Nishizaki: That was probably an accident! (Laughs) I sympathized with the role of Dessler. He was faithful to his desires. Some said that in that way he resembled me very much! (Laughs)
>
> Anno: Dessler's a great character. A lot of anime villains would attack without reason, but with him there was always a good reason. He completely overturned the morality of anime works. His story did a lot to spread the Yamato worldview.
>
> ...Nishizaki: If Yamato failed, I was thinking about quitting the anime business. So I'm really grateful the fans liked the movie and the TV reruns.
>
> Anno: We fans should thank you. If not for Yamato, Japan might not have anime now. Neither anime fans nor Otakus would have been born. Yamato started it all.
>
> Nishizaki: I'm glad the idea of a realistic anime was accepted.
>
> Anno: When I first saw Yamato, I was at the age where we were expected to "graduate" from watching anime. Because I saw it, I continued watching after middle school. It was my whole life in high school. The first animation cel I painted was of Yamato. I shot it with an 8mm camera to make it look like it was flying forward. That was my first self-produced anime. Seeing Yamato got me into anime.

> ANN: Gainax has had to deal with concerns from television stations regarding mature images and themes in previous series. For _Gurren Lagann_, airing at a child-friendly time slot last year, did any television stations raise similar concerns about the series?
>
> [Yasuhiro] Takeda: Well, it's not Gainax's problem — it's the television stations' problem (laughter). We had a number of problems though — in particular, episode 6, the bathhouse episode. If only the television stations would just look through the original scripts when we submitted them instead of waiting until the animation footage was made. When we actually first suggested [the episode], they said, “Oh, it shouldn't be a problem.” Yet, when we completed the animation footage and showed it to them, they said, “There's no way we can show this.” The biggest issue was that peeking into the women's bath — that act alone — is illegal. Therefore, we can't show that during a child-friendly timeslot. Why couldn't they have told us that when we gave them the script before? So we had to do what we could to get it on the air. I mean, we took the script to them, we took the storyboards to them, and eventually, when we finally took the animation footage to them — only then, did they finally say that they had a problem with it.

   --["Interview: Gainax on _Gurren Lagann_"](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2008-07-28/gainax-on-gurren-lagann); possibly relevant to discussions of censorship and rushing in the final episodes - perhaps the network approved the script, per this scenario, even though they would have rejected the animated version

> Toshio Okada on old-school, hundred-proof  "Otaku 1.0" from the Eighties: "individuals who chose to pursue childish hobbies as a means to intellectually and emotionally isolate themselves from society."
>
> Toshio Okada on the current generation of otaku: "a growing ghetto of weak individuals who blame society when others fail to understand their personal interests."
>
> Toshio Okada on himself: "I'm done."
>
> ... He portrays the rise and fall of Japan's otaku in three stages. The first generation are called "otaku aristocrats" -- early adopters from the late Seventies and early Eighties who felt the need to proselytize and convert their friends to the lifestyle. This sense of noblesse oblige eventually gave rise to the second generation of "otaku elite" from the late Eighties through the late Nineties, who spurned and scorned anyone without the good sense to share their taste in entertainment. And finally, this self-centered attitude reached its apex in the current generation of "moé-otaku," purveyors and consumers of anime, comics, and video games that feature infantile female characters instead of plotlines.
>
> Okada defines the otaku crowd he grew up with as a group of "individuals who chose to pursue childish hobbies as a means to emotionally and intellectually isolate themselves from society," defending their behavior as a form of rebellion and empowerment. According to Okada, this early generation of otaku weren't outcasts but rather noble outsiders, individuals who were more than willing to face public scorn rather than give up the things that were important to them. Essentially discriminated against by society at large, they had no choice but to circle their wagons and wall themselves off from it, like native Americans (yes, that is his parallel) forming reservations in an attempt to preserve their way of life. In other words, it wasn't a hobby, it was an cultural group, a tribe
>
> ... In contrast, Okada takes the current generation of otaku to task for continuing to "ghettoize" themselves, retreating ever-deeper into individual virtual worlds when they encounter any sort of resistance to their interests. Where's the sense of pride, of camaraderie? he wonders. He decries their inward focus, their passivity, their apparent lack of desire to learn about or interact with subcultures outside of their own tiny worldviews. (The last is a hallmark difference, at least in Okada's idealized view, between the moe-otaku and traditional old-school otaku, who actually forced themselves to partake of genres or titles they didn't particularly like in order to broaden their horizons.)
>
> ... In the end analysis, Okada's swansong is as much about the collapse of Japan's bubble era (which fueled the super-consumerism that allowed the otaku to flourish) as it is about the collapse of a subculture. Whether you consider him an astute analyst or a sentimental relic pining for times long gone by, there's no question that Okada played a key role in articulating the subtleties of otaku culture to the outside world. Now that he's officially declared Otaku 1.0 dead and buried, who will speak to the secret lives of their modern counterparts?

> 'Hey guys, I've got some interesting tidbits of info from ADV C.E.O. John Ledford while I was at Anime Expo, and they actually sounded somewhat positive. Should I post them here or in the general Anime Expo thread? ... Anyway, John Ledford had some interesting things to say about "Neon Genesis Evangelion". As far as the "Rebuild of Evangelion" movies go, we're not likely to see those come out in North America anytime soon. It has to do with Hideaki Anno, the creator of the original series. These movies are done entirely under his control, they're independent films basically, and he has his own ideas about how they should be released overseas, specifically he thinks they should be released in North America in a way where people will get to watch it for free. Also I know a lot of fans believe ADV likes to hold onto their T.V. shows just to fill up their Anime Network and not take priority with other channels, but it's not as bad as some would think. They've been trying hard to get "Neon Genesis Evangelion" on Cartoon Network since 1997, and obviously we saw some fruits in that with Giant Robot Week, but of course I started talking to John about how that thing just wasn't done well. I asked then why it took so long for them to get it on [adult swim] when they apparently were always interested in it, and he said, "Well it was just Cartoon Network's decision at the time."'

Rumors on the EML nearly had _Eva_ airing on MTV rather than Cartoon Network, and I have heard nothing to the effect that Funimation paid little for _Rebuild_; on the other hand, Anno feeling like that would explain why _Rebuild_ keeps running in theaters despite meager sales & not qualifying for Oscars regardless.

I'm taking Anno's story as a basis, and filtering it through the lens of my own interpretation. I've always considered Evangelion to be, at its heart, the story of the relationship between a father and his son. I've been pursuing this angle from the outset of the manga series, and I'd like to pursue it to the end.

S: The new films were originally intended to be a sort of "digest" of the original television series, but as you can see particularly with You Can (Not) Advance, they've begun to take a direction of their own.

That said, I'd like it if fans appreciated the new films and my manga version as separate stories.

S: Around the time Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise came out, I was young and competitive and channeled all of my efforts into drawing characters that were as detailed and realistic as possible. Taking note of this and reflecting upon it as I began the character designs for my next project, Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water, I tried to make characters that were more animated and expressive, the way that they are in manga. Moving from that project to Evangelion, then on to The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and eventually to Summer Wars, I think that I've slowly eased back into a more detailed and realistic style. Well, FLCL and Diebuster are exceptions, of course (laughter).
>
> Particularly with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summer Wars it was important for me to create designs that fit (director) Mamoru Hosoda's ungilded style of presentation, with the result that, visually, I think the designs do share a lot in common with the designs I did for The Wings of Honneamise.
>
....
>
> S: The new films are so accessible! It really surprised me; it wasn't what I had been expecting. There are certain small details in the presentation, like the way music from the Showa Period is played in the background, that I thought were very Anno-esque, though (laughter). In general, the new films are something just about anybody can enjoy and appreciate. Anno's really calmed down since getting married (laughter).
>
> A lot of people are saying that Shinji is much more optimistic and willful in the new films, particularly in You Can (Not) Advance, but I've always thought that the original film, End of Evangelion, was the exception. Shinji is pretty dark and introspective in End of Evangelion, but I never got that impression of him watching the television series. I was really moved by Shinji's strength and unwillingness to give up in You Can (Not) Advance. I also thought that Rei's character was much less of a question mark. She was more fleshed out. Her speaking style is so rapid fire (laughter)! I really thought that you can perceive her gradual change in character in the new films. Asuka's also more approachable as a character. In a bit of a change from the original series, she doesn't just reject Shinji outright, but actually displays a degree of jealousy. Her character feels more like an actual teenage girl.
>
> The original series, the original film, and the new films are all windows into Anno's inner world, so it's interesting to see all of these changes.
>
> ... S: I thought it was fitting that the new films should include a new character. I really strove to design a character who was distinct from Asuka and Rei, though I do worry that there are some small but telling similarities that remain. My idea was to create a character so distinct from the other Evangelion characters as to almost feel out of place in the Evangelion world. I suppose I could've designed her as a sort of "halfway point" between Asuka and Rei, but Asuka and Rei are both such strong characters, in their own separate ways. I wanted to bring something completely different to the table with Mary.
>
> For Mary, I'd been asked to design a character who "goes about with a parasol, like the sort of heroine you see in an anime". As I initially designed her, she was very adult-like, having attended a strict private Christian school in Britain. However, in the original script, there was a scene where she returns home to a room full of birds and dogs and begins talking to them, to indicate that she was also rather idiosyncratic. Mr. Anno had also requested that she be more adult-like in appearance and manner than either Asuka or Rei, to set her apart. And that she have a huge chest (laughter).
>
> There was a television drama I'd really been enjoying at the time I began designing Mary. The heroine in this drama had a pair of long ponytails. I really liked this character feature, and worked it into Mary's design. After all was said and done, we ended up with the design that we have now, although there are still many elements of my personal tastes and interests of the time in Mary's design (laughter).
>
> Incidentally, I decided to give Mary glasses because I thought that this would be a simple yet affective way to set her apart from the other characters. Some people have said that she "doesn't seem like an Evangelion character", which is exactly what I was aiming for. I'm glad to see, though, that the majority of people have appreciated her character.
>
> YA: How did you go about designing Mary's uniform and plug suits?
>
> S: I'd been asked to make Mary seem very British, so I tried to design accordingly. For her school uniform, I thought that a large bow and long socks, along with a traditional checked skirt, would look the part.
>
> For Mary's old plug suit, I combined a rich green that seemed to me very reminiscent of British clothing with the design aesthetic of the space suits the Soviets were using around the time of the Cold War. The Soviet space suits are the reason for the checkered pattern of the lower half of the suit. Because Unit Five uses a lance, I also looked at a lot of fencing outfits and tried to incorporate elements of those into the design of her suit, as well. However, I also included what look like large plugs where pipes and the like could go, to convey the impression that this is, after all, a plug suit just the same as those of Shinji and the others.
>
> On the other hand, when I designed her new plug suit, I wanted it to look more sleek, capable and well-crafted than the other plug suits. I wanted it to have the appearance of something that was just manufactured using the latest technology. For inspiration, I looked at the design differences between the Lotus Elise Series I and Series II. Lotus' vehicles really have that feel of a classic design updated to the cutting edge.
>
> ...
>
> YA: We don't suppose you can drop any hints about the upcoming, third Evangelion film?
>
> S: Actually, I've yet to hear anything from Anno at all, so I really can't (laughter). Even with things like Mary appearing in both You Are (Not) Alone and You Can (Not) Advance, the story followed that of the television series to some extent, but who knows? Maybe the next story will be a complete departure from the television series. Given the possibilities, it should really be interesting to see where things go from here.
>
> YA: Which do you think will end first, the new films or the new manga series?
>
> S: Hmm... good question (laughter). I think I'd like to wrap up the manga series first, and begin to devote my time to Q, my upcoming project.

Key quotes respectively ([lightly edited](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=362339#362339)):

- Share with us your impressions after reading the script.

— [Megumi] Wow! I did not expect! This is a breakthrough! Otpad, I burst!

...

- Do you think, what actually changed "Eve"?

— [Megumi] It has become a bit brighter, such as light of heart, but that's all. In the same series, before sharing feelings with each other, Asuka and Shinji just playing games, just having fun with Kensuke and Toji. And it's all very strange. There is clearly some kind of trick.

- What are you so impressed in his story?

- [Maya] I said that Marie had destroyed "the former Eva".

...

— Parting words filmmakers somehow affected the result?

— [Maya] When I heard about the "destruction", then realized what an important role, and at the same time extremely responsible mission entrusted to me.I'm sure: to destroy the so ingrained image of the product, the new creation must be a monstrous adventure. And I threw all worries about leaving "Old Eva", and decided to voice Mari as some kind of an alien element, that today's Anno needs.


> 2 - Can you give us the status of ongoing projects including Aoki Uru and feature Tadashi Hiramatsu (Ghost Rhapsody)?
>
> Aoki Uru est un projet de Hiroyuki Yamaga et constitue une sorte de suite au premier long métrage du studio, Wings of Honneamise. [Aoki Uru is a project of Hiroyuki Yamaga and is a kind of sequel to the first feature film studio, Wings of Honneamise.] Ce projet datant d'une dizaine d'années, il fut interrompu assez rapidement faute de sponsors. [This project dating back ten years, was interrupted quickly enough due to lack of sponsors.] Actuellement, M. Yamaga aimerais relancer l'idée qui a mûrir sur de nouvelles bases depuis. [Currently, Mr. Yamaga like to revive the idea that has since matured on a new basis.] Personnellement, ce projet étant quelque chose d'innovant à tous points de vue, j'ai le sentiment que la production s'avèrera difficile si cela doit être produit uniquement au sein de notre studio. [Personally, this project is something innovative at all points of view, I feel that the production will prove difficult if this should be produced only by our studio.] Il est vrai que nous sommes entrain de faire « grandir » Gainax notamment pour que ce projet puisse être réalisé entièrement par notre société. [It is true that we are spirits to "grow" Gainax to include this project can be fully realized by our company.]

There was an interview with Tsurumaki in which he confessed that during the production of "Ha" they still weren't sure about what to do with Mari, even the name which was tentatively "Mariko".

> We don't decide the music on our own at Gainax. Depending on the series we have different sponsors, like Evangelion had King Records, who said we had to use their musicians. For Gurren Lagann we were working with Aniplex, which is part of Sony, so we had to use Sony artists. We actually wanted a guy rock band to do the opening music, and Sony said that they didn't have one, so how about using Shokotan, and that's how Shoko Nakagawa sang the opening song. So sometimes stuff like that happens, and that's how music gets selected. Weird coincidences and stuff.

> Someone asked if Neon Genesis Evangelion ended the way it did due to budget problems. Yamaga responded that the problem was with time, not with budget. He then stated that the television ending was planned to be as it was from the beginning; Gainax thought "Wouldn't it be interesting if the show ended this way?". I brought up that the 1993 proposal created to attract sponsors contains a different ending in its summary, and asked if the proposal's ending was made up because nobody would sponsor a show if they knew what the real ending would be. Yamaga knew nothing of the proposal and told me that if I got my information off the Internet, somebody probably made it up. I responded that the proposal was in Newtype, and upon the translator's request repeated that the proposal was from 1993. Yamaga responded that he didn't believe the show had an ending at that point.
>
> ...Someone asked about the canceled Wings of Honneamise sequel. Yamaga said it was never canceled, but is on indefinite hiatus. The man who was to sponsor it was arrested for financial matters the translator was vague about, but he's out of jail now and building a rocket that he intends to fly into space.
>
> ...A man said "You probably get asked this a lot, but" the television ending of Evangelion was "not well received by a lot of people", and asked if End of Evangelion was created as revenge against the fans. Yamaga said that everyone at Gainax was satisfied with the TV ending, repeating that it had been planned that way from the beginning, but once the show was over the staff still wanted to do "more Eva", so they made the films. For the sake of making sure Yamaga had to repeat himself a third time, Sailor Stardust asked if the script for episode 25′ was based on the intended script for episode 25, and Yamaga said once again that the television ending was the one they'd always intended. Fans like to make up rumors.

In the same vein, <http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=359336#359336>:

> According to Hiroyuki Yamaga, they had no budget problems with Eva, but they did have scheduling problems. This is consistent with Tsurumaki's statements in the Red Cross Book. What I found really surprising, because I've never seen this stated anywhere, is that Yamaga insisted that Neon Genesis Evangelion's television ending was planned from the beginning. In his (translator's) exact words, they thought "Wouldn't it be interesting if the show ended this way?". I asked if the alternate ending in the 1993 proposal was made up because they knew nobody would sponsor the show's real ending, but Yamaga didn't know what I was talking about. He said that if I got my information from the Internet, someone probably made it up. I said the proposal was printed in Newtype, repeated (at translator's request) that it was from 1993, and Yamaga responded that he didn't believe the show had an ending at that point.

Yamaga must be treated cautiously <http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=359409#359409> as NAveryW remarks:

> "Yamaga has made contradictory statements in the past and even during that one panel. For example, someone asked about the international anime industry and Yamaga mentioned that anime studios, including Gainax, now have an international audience in mind and try to make series Americans will like. However, a few questions later, Carl Horn asked about how the language barrier affects internationalization, and Yamaga responded that it's impossible for them to tell what shows foreign audiences like so Gainax just does things the way they've always done-- making shows for Japanese audiences."

...

> That's good, because some fans out here feel like some studios are pushing out moe  show after moe show and that they aren't really trying to push the boundaries anymore. Do you have any thoughts on that?

> I don't think it's just Gainax that's trying to push boundaries…the companies that are still around are the ones that are doing it right. But with so much moe anime out there…I think that only one or two of those titles really sold well, and anyone can see that, but they keep producing it…which is why I don't want to do it! But if moe was really selling that well, we'd probably do it too.

...

> What do you think is the biggest fan misconception about Gainax-- one thing people might assume about Gainax and its employees that just isn't true?

> That we have lots of money. That's so not true. I remember some fans from overseas came to see our office, and since Gainax is such a well-known name they thought they'd see some impressive building, a big high-rise or something...but it's just a regular small building, they were quite shocked.

...

> Was that a specific goal in designing the EVA units? Bigger than Gundam?

Carl Horn [writes](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=369167#369167) about [rumors](http://www.japanator.com/rumor-gainax-and-evangelion-remakes-splitting-up--15139.phtml) that Gainax & Khara are bitter enemies:

> "Anno and Yamaga go way back; they were in the same dorm at college, and have been making films together just as long. I asked Yamaga-san directly about the Gainax/Khara split. He said that it wasn't that he and Anno had a fight or anything, it was more that in 2006 Yamaga wanted Gainax to make _Gurren Lagann_, and Anno wanted Gainax to make _Rebuild_. Since they couldn't make both at the same time and Anno was set on _Rebuild_, they came to an understanding that Anno would form his own studio for that purpose; i.e., Studio Khara--and that way, of course, both anime got made."

But Miyazaki rejected this idea.

But Miyazaki did not allow it because there was no time. So, five pieces animation cel were used. And Miyazaki did not allow the use of three colors for a shade. He did not allow two colors either at first, but accepted it. Anno says "There was a memo "If you use three colors, I will kill you" from Miya-san."

For whatever it's worth, here's some interesting information from the 2.22 booklet (that comes with the DVD/BD): "Test Plug Suit: This design, based on rough drawings by Hideaki Anno, was the culmination of the ideas of pop idol-loving staff members, and derived from "Aim for the Top Gunbusters (sic) 2", an anime by Shigeto Koyama, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and Kazuya Tsurumaki. Based on a proposal by Koyama to position the sensor array like buttons so that they penetrate to the center, the final refinements were made by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. The head sensor retains the bunny girl image originating in a proposal by Anno."'

> CF: Were you surprised how different the Asuka in 2.0 is compared to the Asuka in the television series?
>
> YM: Yes, I was. Not only because of her personality change but also because she has a different name. In the first series her name was Asuka Langley Soryu. In the new movies it has changed to Asuka Langley Shikinami.
>
> CF: Why your character's last name has changed?

> CF: What are some of the biggest challenges you have to undertake in the role of Asuka?
>
> YM: The role of Asuka in the new movies was easy for me because I have been her voice for many years. However in the new movies I also did the voice acting for Evangelion Unit 3. It was my first time doing the voice of character/creature, so that was very challenging for me.

> CF: Did Megumi Ogata (Shinji) really strangle you while recording the voices for the End Of Evangelion to get a realistic performance?

> Sadamoto: As in the concept, we wanted it to be “genuine EVA seifuku”. In animation we have to draw numerous cells, so we have to keep it simple. This goes for the expression of the characters and other details. We have to abbreviate many details when making an anime. But I wanted to include all the abbreviated parts of the anime into the detail of the genuine seifuku to make it real, even though imaginary. The seifuku in the anime is simplified, so lets make the original – this became the concept. Let's not just reproduce the drawing, lets make the genuine seifuku that the anime is based on.

   <http://www.sekai-seifuku.org/en/interview1_1/>

> asianbeat: Which part of the uniform were you particular about?
>
> Sadamoto: I suppose it is the lines rather than the total shape. The fine shirt fabric, the starched lines and folds, the body in places with room – I thought these areas are the most attractive parts….though some may say it might be a fetish (LOL) Maybe it is because I am an anime artist that I am fussy about the body. When I first started drawing I drew white cloths with definite folds and lines. Perhaps it is because I draw that I reacted to the “smart lines and folds”. I reckon that if you get the right fabric it can give an impression of being genuine.
>
> Aiura: Well the fabric we have used for the shirts is the same as what we use for actual seifuku. Fabric selection is of the utmost importance. The checked skirt that the new Evangelion character Mari wears is a woven tartan check with warp and weft weave. There is no comparison between a mere print and the real woven fabric.
>
> asianbeat: In the projects you have been involved in, have you been particular about what seifuku you want a certain character to wear?
>
> Sadamoto:No, I haven't been so particular about design. It is more of a means to depict a character. Some wear their uniforms neatly, and others wear their pants low on the waist. But by lining the two types together I can create a contrast in character. That's how I use it. I don't make many anime where all girls wear seifuku. It is very difficult to use seifuku in animation, like where the skirt is pleated and waves as the character moves. I once was in charge of a scene where four to five girls wearing seifuku walked into a restaurant and all sat down. It took about three days, but it was on air for an instant. Just hearing the word “seifuku” makes me say “aahhh”.
>
> asianbeat: For an animator the thought of seifuku seems to bring a reaction of "this will be hard”. In depicting the different character and style of the girls was it difficult to make the seifuku?
>
> Sadamoto: Hard…well it was difficult to, let's say find a loose fitting one for Ayanami with her indifferent character, where Asuka needed to wear a more tight fitting one. I had that kind of, image of what suited who. When I got the first sample from CONOMi and saw the baggy form they had worked on, it wasn't quite there.

    <http://www.sekai-seifuku.org/en/interview1_2/>

> Sadamoto: Seifuku itself was on the scene before with the Russian girls unit t.A.T.u. But I think the reason for its recent popularity is largely to do with Japanese anime. Recent Japanese animation is full of soft high school dramas where nobody gets killed or hurt, and I think people long for this kind of school experience. Everyone getting together and having fun – I think this is what people prefer.
>
> Sakurai: Speaking of seifuku, when I went to the Salon del Manga in Barcelona in 2007 (Spain's biggest ever Japanese anime/manga event) I interviewed two girls wearing seifuku. I asked them "Why do you wear seifuku" to which they replied "Japanese high school girl's seifuku is a symbol of freedom".
>
> Sadamoto: Freedom!?
>
> Sakurai: I double checked to see if I got their answer right to which they replied "yes, it is unmistakably freedom". Overseas girls didn't have a concept of school uniforms being fashionable, but when they see Japanese girls shortening the skirt length and arranging their seifuku freely, overseas girls begin to think the seifuku fashion is cool and pay the Japanese school girls respect.
>
> Sadamoto: That's interesting, especially because seifuku was originally designed to restrict fashion freedom.
>
> Sakurai: It seems like they are taking our culture as a sort of a counter culture. And Chinese high school girls have said, that to them, Japanese high school itself is seems like a fantasy. Dying their hair brown, wearing seifuku – unheard of in China. To them it seems like the reality of Japan and the world of anime are one and the same. This is symbolized by their desire to wear seifuku. The seifuku in the anime has become the object of girls' desire – especially in China.
>
> Aiura: For us in the seifuku making industry we get a lot of inspiration from anime, movies and TV dramas when creating a garment. On the other hand, I think animators use actual high school seifuku to base their creations on. Anime is not necessarily detached from reality, and it is a bit like the chicken and the egg. I feel that kawaii seifuku is a result of this mutual synergy.

   <http://www.sekai-seifuku.org/en/interview2_1/>

> Sadamoto: I have asked people why they prefer the world of anime and manga, and they reply that they used to be fans of idols in their early twenties. But those young idols grow older and get married, and when they do it is a cold shock to the system – but Lum Invader will never get married! They say "I would rather be in the anime world where you never age", and I can see where they are coming from. If you are going to follow an idol who is out of reach, you may as well follow a two-dimensional anime/manga idol.
>
> Sakurai: Anime is a big factor behind the popularity of seifuku among junior and high school girls overseas. There have been some cases of anime seifuku being reproduced overseas, but to tell the truth the quality wasn't much good. They must long for the seifuku that Japanese wear. Is it difficult to draw seifuku in anime?
>
> Sadamoto: Yes it is. You can't cut corners drawing seifuku. Drawing pleats sends a shiver down my spine. For example, with Mari's skirt, I have instructed that only the outline of her skirt be pleated. We don't draw the pleat lines. We only draw the check lines. We don't draw any vertical lines, just draw the outline fluttering. Just think of how difficult it is. Ayanami's Tokyo-3 First Municipal Middle School Girls Uniform has two pleats in the front and one at the back and I'm always thinking how to reduce the number! If you have a pleated skirt and you want to make the skirt flutter the pleats make it really difficult. If only I could even reduce just one line… Perhaps I am being too pessimistic here?
>
> ...Sakurai: Mari's seifuku is a kawaii design that you could wear to school as is.
>
> Sadamoto: Yes. When I got the instructions on Mari's seifuku design, the document consisted of only two lines: British-style and Christian Missionary School-style. When I asked the general director Anno-san "What is Missionary School-style", he replied "I don't know, create an image from the words"! I then asked him for some reference material and a few days later he brought some photos of British school girls and said "Like this". All their skirts were long – 15cm below the knee – and some looked so old! Looking at all the photos I found that many used check designs, most school girls wore tights and the blazers had colored edges. I used these features in creating the design. I told Amano san that if she didn't wear a blazer it wouldn't look very British. In the trailer of EVA 1 you know Mari is wearing a Blazer, but in EVA 2 it would not be right if she wore one so I changed the design.
>
> ...Sadamoto: I think the Tartan check looks cute because of the combination with the mini skirt. If it was longer it just wouldn't look so cute. It has become a bit of a boom recently.
>
> Sakurai: Come to think of it, Tartan check mini skirts are a Japanese invention aren't they?
>
> Sadamoto: You may be right. Also, with the combination of black knee-high socks to make the zettai ryoiki is also a Japanese original.

   <http://www.sekai-seifuku.org/en/interview2_2/>


> Sadamoto: Yes, pink is the symbol of femininity. In anime we can't really use white. It would break up the background. We add a shade of another color to white, sometimes green and sometimes blue to match the character's complexion, so we often add a little pink to the white background. However, I think I put in blue for Ayanami. Pink has been popular for a long time in the anime world. Speaking of pink, at first it wasn't used at all for Mari's plug suit and we didn't even test it. For over two weeks we would try green, then yellow, and then it struck me "Pink is it". We photoshopped in pink and it was perfect, and decided on the spot to make it pink.
>
> Sakurai:Wow! I can't imagine Mari's plug suit being any color other than pink – it's perfect.
>
> Sadamoto: Ayanami's plug suit is white, and Asuka's is red. Pink is in between these two colors and it loses some impact, so I did think about making it a more outrageous color. Black would be more British, but a bit harsh, so I went for green. Mari's older model plug suit is green, but I was surprised how much pink suited her.
>
> Kitamura: This pink is a very kawaii color. I feel more kawaii just by wearing pink. My image of Mari is not kawaii, but the color really suits her.
>
> ...Sakurai: Well, America has the chain store culture. For example, if an American opened a maid café, rather than giving each store their own special atmosphere they would probably make it into a chain store franchise. High school girls adjust the length of their skirt, trying to look different to others in a way that nobody really notices, is important to Japanese. Japan likes this kind of minute, unique adjustment. I think seifuku and anime goods have reached this stage.
>
> ...Sadamoto: Character design is much the same – trying to be the first to put out the opposite of what is in fashion. Ayanami's black socks are an example. When it was first broadcast the loose socks were in the middle of a boom. I thought to myself that it would be embarrassing to draw loose socks at a time when they are so popular, so I went the other way and drew black socks. I was rather hesitant at first about drawing something "not in fashion" back then, but I thought that they would suit a character like Ayanami. Now, fashion has caught up with her and you see black socks everywhere and her socks now look common. Seifuku in its basic form has appeal so most people balk at going against the basic norms in design.

> In junior high school, he was a member of the school's art club. Anno didn't bother with basic figure drawing practice, and instead devoted his time to manga and oil paintings.
>
> One particular subject that Anno excelled in flunking at was English, a state of affairs that began when he rebelled against his English teacher during his first year in junior high school. But thanks to a makeup exam where the answers were given out prior to the test, he was able to graduate with no questions asked. As it so happens, Japan's university entrance exam system was completely revamped the year Anno was set to apply, and the then-new National Standardized Primary Examinations for College Entrance were established. English was a required subject in the exams, and as a result, Anno's enthusiasm for the university entrance exams evaporated and his interest in studying waned even further.
>
> He hardly studied at all in the one-year period after he flunked his college entrance exam, a time in which he was supposed to be studying to retake it the following year. Instead, he worked part-time making morning and evening newspaper deliveries, played mahjong, religiously recorded episodes of Mobile Suit Gundam as it was first broadcast, and engaged in other manga- and anime-related activities day in and day out. Eventually, his parents and his former high school—  which was desperate to not have its alumni acceptance percentage lowered — begged him to pursue a university education, and thus Anno finally resolved to study and prepare for the entrance exams. But then, leafing through the numerous university brochures he had gathered aimlessly, he noticed one college, the private Osaka University of Arts, was willing to approve applications based not on scholastic test scores, but rather on successful display of required skills. Furthermore, upon learning that acceptance into the Department of Visual Concept Planning was (at the time) based on providing original continuity sheets (a detailed form of storyboards), Anno's mind was put at ease, so he went back to goofing around.
>
> In 1980, the same year Ultraman 80 was broadcast, Anno successfully entered the Osaka University of Arts. While on campus, he met Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai, and together they worked on their required school work assignments. During his sophomore year, an invitation from a friend lead Anno to participate in the production of the opening animation sequence of the 20th Japan Science Fiction Convention in Osaka (commonly known as DAICON III). Anno fell in love with the joys of the team effort that went into film production and the preparation and execution of conventions.
>
> Anno participated in the production of the work produced by the DAICON FILM group, produced as a means of promoting the 22nd Japan Science Fiction Convention, as well as to help train the participating crew and staff. Although this was an independent film project, Anno was overwhelmed by the pressures of being a director of such a major undertaking involving large numbers of people, causing him to become frustrated in his lack of interpersonal communication skills.
>
> Later on, invitations from members of Studio Nue who had seen the opening animation sequence of DAICON III, coupled with the personality and career of animation director Ichiro Itano, lead Anno to participate in the production of the TV series version of Super Dimension Fortress Macross. He gained invaluable experience from working and sleeping at the studio offices, as well as Itano's apartment. The bizarre allure of the production studio had Anno in its spell. It was around this time that Anno first met Yoshiyuki Sadamoto and Mahiro Maeda.
>
> And then, in 1983, Anno participated in the production of the opening animation sequence (directed by Hiroyuki Yamaga) featured at the 22nd Japan Science Fiction Convention in Osaka (a.k.a. DAICON IV.) Once again, Anno was mesmerized by the magic of completing a film and wrapping up a showcase event.
>
> Busy with making self-financed films, Anno stayed away from college and didn't bother to pay his tuition, and before long, he was expelled. Thus, he took this opportunity to look for work in Tokyo. The result was that Anno was hired as a key animator by director Hayao Miyazaki for the 1984 film Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind. He moved to Tokyo with a single bag and all his hopes riding on that one job. Once again, he spent all his time at the studio offices, and following Nausicaä, he worked on the 1984 film Macross: Do You Remember Love? (directed by Noboru Ishiguro and Shōji Kawamori.) During the production of the movie adaptation of Macross, Anno met Shō-ichi Masuo and helped establish an independent animation studio named Studio Gravitron that gathered together numerous freelance animators. He worked side by side with animators such as Katsuhiko Nishijima and Kōji Itō, who were members of the studio at the time. Now, Anno would live at the offices of Studio Gravitron and only work on projects when he was broke or when something caught his fancy. In this way, Anno fell victim to the seduction of an idle, decadent lifestyle. It was around this time that he first met Masayuki, Shinji Higuchi, and Toshimichi Ootsuki. Back then, Anno used to tool around Tokyo on a moped that was given to him by Miyazaki.
>
> In 1984, Anno was a founding member of Gainax, a corporation that brought together friends and workmates from his Osaka days that was established to produce the theatrical film Royal Space Force. He was also involved in the production of the initial pilot film for the movie. The Gainax studio was established inside a large apartment at Takadanobaba. Once the initial presentation was complete, Anno traveled overseas for the first time for the purpose of conducting research for the film. He witnessed a launching of the space shuttle and traveled across America, thus learning a little something about the size and scope of the world. He regretted not paying more attention in his English classes. Alas, this was forgotten as soon as he arrived back in Japan at Narita Airport.
>
> In 1986, after nearly 18 months of work on developing the script and visual designs of the film, animation production finally started to begin in earnest for Wings of Riquinni - Royal Space Force, (the working title at the time), a film by Hiroyuki Yamaga that would be released in 1987. The studio was moved to Kichijōji in order to accommodate the large number of people participating in the production. Anno took on the responsibility of recruiting staff for the film, as well as contributing as a mechanical designer and acting as director of animation. Anno was once again captivated by the experience of producing a feature film and attracted by the allure of working as an animator. It was around this time that he finally decided to rent an apartment in the Tokyo area.
>
> After the release of Wings of Honneamise - Royal Space Force, Anno distanced himself from Gainax slightly and worked more closely with Studio Gravitron, which had recently moved because of the increasing numbers of animators that were joining its ranks. But one day,he happened by chance to read through the script of the 2nd episode of an original video animation project that had lapsed into development limbo because no director was attached to the project. This project was Gunbuster, and Anno was moved to tears by Hiroyuki Yamaga's script. He agonized over the question for while, but he decided he would apply to assume the mantle of director on the project. But due to certain issues that came into play, the start of production was delayed somewhat, so Anno took the opportunity to participate in the production of Isao Takahata's 1987 film Grave of the Fireflies. Nearly one month's worth of hard work by Anno went into a sequence depicting the Heavy Cruiser Maya, but seeing how the ship was blackened out on screen left him feeling dejected.
>
> In 1988, Anno assumed the role of director over the 1988 original video animation Gunbuster!, a dedicated commercial project. He encountered numerous situations that he had never faced before, and due to various factors, Anno accepted the job of chief director on the 1990 TV series Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, at which point he was swamped with even more situations that he had never known before. He learned firsthand the horrors that lurk within the production of a TV animation series. It was around this time that he met Kazuya Tsurumaki.
>
> In 1991, Anno spent many unproductive days as a result of his inability to mentally distance himself from the Nadia series even after the broadcast had ended. He would work out numerous plans and projects, both on his own initiative and in collaboration with others, but they all fell through, and in the end, Anno's idle days were dotted with projects that he imploded by design. In the midst of all this, one project, a feature film entitled Blue Uru, finally took shape and animation production began, only to be shut down due to circumstances beyond his control. With this shutdown, the days where Anno was spinning his wheels in wasted effort came to an end. It was around this time that he suddenly took up "normal" hobbies, such as scuba diving and skiing.
>
> Immediately after Blue Uru was put on indefinite hold, Ootsuki called up Anno to talk about something, but conversation shifted toward the subject of TV animation projects. The two of them agreed that there was a need for an all-original TV animation series, something not based on some other work. Ootsuki remarking, "Bring me something, anything, and I'll make sure it gets green-lit" lead to Anno assuming the role of director of the 1995 TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Anno encountered a wide array of experiences he had never faced before, and immediately after the series finished airing, he broke down.
>
> In 1996, Anno traveled alone to Tappizaki, Sōyamisaki, and Rebuntō Island, walking around in sandals in a season when snow was still on the ground. This was a time for Anno where the days slipped by with no purpose and no meaning. Thanks to the support of his friends and colleagues, Anno was somehow able to bounce back six months later, and worked on the 1997 film edition of Neon Genesis Evangelion as chief director. But faced with the situation where the film was not ready for its spring release, Anno encountered further heartbreaks and valuable experiences. At this same time, Anno became bewitched by the promise that new digital cameras held for live-action photography. It was around this time that he met Miyuki Nanri.
>
> Perhaps as a reaction to working on the Eva films, Anno worked on his first commercial live-action film Love & Pop immediately after. The 1998 film was based on the novel by Ryu Murakami. Once more, Anno was gripped by not only the allure of live-action movies themselves, but also by aspects of their filming and production that he was previously unfamiliar with. After the release of the movie, Anno traveled to Morocco at a friend's behest and saw the Sahara Desert firsthand. This was the first time he had traveled somewhere overseas beyond the United States and Korea. The journey involved layovers in London and Frankfurt, giving Anno the opportunity to experience each city, if only to briefly breathe in their air. Anno was dumbfounded by the majesty of the vast dessert. [See the 1997 P item discussing Miyazaki and Anno's Sahara trip]
>
> Next, Anno directed the 1999 TV series His and Her Circumstances based on the shōjō manga by Masami Tsuda. He also worked as chief director on the behind the scenes video companion to Gamera 3, titled Gamera 1999. He encountered a fast-paced, highly condensed work schedule that was unlike anything he had experienced before.
>
> And then in 2000, Anno helmed a live-action film one more time, Shiki-Jitsu, based on the novel by Fumiko Fujitani. This was his first experience with 35mm film production, and Anno was absorbed by its delights, both in terms of visual impact and the enhanced qualities of filming 35mm in the field. Later on, a series of short, hectic assignments would dominate Anno's work schedule. He would work on a promo video for Takako Matsu, then return to animation after a considerable hiatus with Anime Tenchō, and then work on a short, live-action film project, Ryusei Kachō.
>
> On March 26th of 2002, Anno filed the paperwork for marriage with manga artist Moyoco Anno. This was his first experience with married life. Later on, people close to him would remark that Anno had changed, both physically and mentally (he lost weight and became less edgy). Following his marriage ceremonies in June of 2002, Anno started driving again. It occurred to Anno that driving is an interesting medium to facilitate communication.
>
> Work on the Eva renewal, which started in Autumn of 2002, grew to tremendous proportions, and Anno ended up spending nearly 6 months on that process alone. Then in spring of 2003, production of the Cutie Honey project that Anno had been working on since the Autumn of 2000 finally kicked into high gear. Overcoming the harsh reality that a film could languish in development for over two years while its actual production could take a mere six months, Anno completed the DLP version in December of 2003. During production, Anno shed tears of joy over watching the rush print of his first live-action special effects scene that featured miniatures. It was a moment where he reaffirmed his love affair with the tokusatsu genre. Later on, Anno acted as chief director in the animated spin-off of the live-action Cutie Honey project, Re: Cutie Honey. He also participated in TV commercial production, appeared in movies, and provided assistance on numerous projects belonging to other people.
>
> In May of 2006, Anno established a new movie planning and production company, Khara Inc. In September of 2006, he created Studio Khara as a place where movie production could be undertaken. One year later, in September of 2007, its first production film, Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone was released in theaters.
>
> In October of 2007, Anno resigned from Gainax Co. Ltd.
>
> Anno was unable to go home for over four months during the so-called “crunch period,” in which the successful completion of the film constantly hung in the balance. But in the end, the second film was completed and the first print was successfully screened. In June of 2009, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance was released in theaters.

> ANN.au: Considering how popular Evangelion is, do you have Japanese fans flying to Australia or the US and trying to find you because you are Asuka? Do they go over the line?
>
> Yūko Miyamura: In the past there was a time when I had a stalker and I have had many scary incidents. Recently, there haven't been many stalker-like fans, but there have been people who have followed me to a Hawaiian convention and SMASH, and they're more friends and family than they are fans. They know me more than my husband now.
>
> ANN.au: What direction do you think anime in Japan is taking? Do you like where it is going?
>
> Yūko Miyamura: It's a difficult question, but I've always thought about this. For four years I've been a sound director, and the sound director can't give an opinion on the story. Sometimes I wonder if the stories are appropriate for children. I would like this age to revive many themes of old anime, easily understood themes like friendship and love--I would like to see shows with these themes to come back.

> Comments on _Kandoku Shikkaku_ from director Hideaki Anno: "Why did I want to make this movie?"
>
> 2010 Feb I got a phone call from Amagi-san (who worked in the production team of this movie). It was about "do you want to make a new film from Hirano-san together?". Although at that time I was short of time and mental energy because of the making of Rebuild Eva and working as a company CEO and I thought "if I agree to take this it will be tough.", I immediately answered "I'll do it.". I felt in my guts that the title I heard was a good one, but more than that, I wanted to repay Hirano-san.
>
> 1997 May at the recommendation of Amgai-san I watched "Yumika". It was the time when I was mentally absolutely tired and worn down with the making of the old Eva movie. The "power of images" that could not be expressed by animation was there. And looking at the images of Yumika-san and Hirano-san himself captured and weaved together, I thought "I cannot overtake these people..". And due to that to use some exaggerated expression I felt "I was saved".
> For repaying, it is because it helped free my heart which was totally closed up by that feeling.
>
> 2010 March, I met Hirano-san. It was the first time we met since I could not manage to greet him at the farewell ceremony of Yumika-san. While we drank, I asked him what movie he wanted to make. I also asked him what will be his motivation. I could feel that the feeling coming from his answer "If I do not put a break with Yumika behind me I cannot do anything next. Because of that I will face Yumika once again." was similar to what I felt when I was making Eva again in order to escape from the cursed embrace of Eva. I just listened quietly to Hirano-san and just kept nodding.
> And then I knew that this is not a movie that can be made just with the thought of repayment by turning that general idea into a movie. There must be quite a bit of "mental preparation" in doing production work.
> And I promised him "I will help you" while I drank up the sake. As I wanted Hirano-san to move forward even if it means confronting face on to the death of one human individual.
>
> 2010 October, after the third edit rush, I finally came to see the result from director Hirano.
> I just kept crying at the last scene. I could only shed tears when I thought about the feeling of Hirano-san, who was chased to the breaking point by the process of editing work that any sane person would not be able to tackle. At that time I thought "it was good" to get this movie made.
>
> 2011 March the test showing of the version 0 of the completed work of "Kandoku Shikkaku" was held. And with this Hirano-san now hopes to move on to his next work. And now I just want everyone to go and watch this work. As it would be difficult to describe this work with my words.

    > From the Profile of Kaworu in Chapter 1 the Characters:
    >
    >
    >> Report 4: Born from Adam
    >>
    >> The reason why Kaworu could set his synchro rate with Eva02 at will is because like Eva02 he was born from Adam. Had the Eva not had a soul already, he could have merged into the Eva. He could also control the Eva without actually piloting from inside.
    >> - The reason why reconfiguration of core is not necessary is because he had the same soul as the Eva.
    >> - Because the soul inside the Eva was closed inside its shell, he could control the Eva at his will.
    >
    > ...For Shinji, it has one page that gave his "Mind's journey". It credited his opening up to his encounter with Rei and "other classmates", with the high point being the party at Misato's place. After that it wrote:
    >
    >> With repeated demanding battles and then "death of Rei", Shinji's mind got more and more weary. He lost the thing he wanted to protect and he started to close up his heart again. Now he started to have questions regarding protection of this world.
    >
    > It also mentioned his seeing his mother in the second times when Eva01 went berserk.
    >
    > And in Report 4 of Shinji's Profile, it touched upon Shinji's relationship with his father:
    >
    >
    >> Report 4 - Gap with his father
    >
    >> Because Shinji was put to live with his uncle and for over 10 years he did not hear from his father, Shinji held a strong feeling of being abandoned, and he was not comfortable facing his father. On the other hand, he also had in his heart a desire to be recognized by his father.
    >> - Shinji had this struggle in his heart that he hated his father but he did not want to hate him. Deep in his heart he wanted to believe in him as his father.
    >> - In the emergency situation when Nerv HQ was assaulted by JSSDF, Shinji got to hear the real mind of his father (the manga drawing has Gendou snatching Shinji by his shirt and drew him in, saying "Since the moment you were born, I was jealous of you who got all the love from Yui your mother.")
    >
    > There is another page which is about "Shinji's Personality" and basically it said he piloted Eva purely to get his father to recognized him as his son, though later he volunteered to pilot Eva because he knew he wanted to protect everybody.

> From what I can parse out, Tsurumaki was pointing out the convention in animation direction, that the “good guy” is normally on the *left* hand side of the screen, while the “bad guy” is on the *right* hand side of the screen…and how Evangelion subverted this convention.
>
> The first episode of Evangelion is basically setting up the audience with expectations that this will be a generic and cliched “Giant Robot” show, while the second episode knocks those expectations down and turns everything on its head:  unlike stereotypical Giant Robots which are hulking armored samurai-like mecha (think Mazinger Z), the second episode reveals that Evangelions are animalistic beasts, extremely fast and *savage* in combat.  They're not eve “mechas”, but living cyborgs covered in battle armor, cloned from the very alien “Angels” which they've been sent out to fight.  Watching Eva-01 take out the Third Angel Sachiel is like watching a cheetah take down a gazelle.   The whole “berserker mode” sequence in episode 2 was unlike anything anime fans had ever seen when it debuted in 1995.
>
> As Tsurumaki explains in the lecture, the actual direction they used in the “camerawork” also provided a subtle emotional cue for this:   in episode 1, when we're supposed to think its a “normal” Giant Robot show, the Angel Sachiel initially appears on the right hand side of the screen as it attacks the United Nations military forces, because it is conventional for the “bad guy” to be on the right hand side of the screen. However, when Evangelion Unit-01 is deployed at the very end of episode 1, and throughout the battle with Sachiel which continues into episode 2, it shown on the *right* hand side of the screen, where the “bad guy” should traditionally be, while Sachiel now always appears on the *left* hand side, where the “good guy” used to be.
>
> So its basically a subtle hint that the Evangelion Units aren't really the “good guys” at all, the humans using them are playing with forces beyond their understanding, and the Evas are actually more brutal, savage, and dangerous than the Angels themselves.  Just as in this fight Eva-01 breaks genre conventions and does all the things that *used* to be associated with the “bad guy” in Giant Robot shows — acting like a beast, roaring, breaking limbs, savagely stabbing Sachiel with its own shattered rib — the camerawork and cinematography itself puts Eva-01 in the position which conventionally would be that of “the bad guy” in a fight, approaching from the right hand side of the screen.

The fact _Nadia_ was a big hit (not as big as _Eva_, but big) yet Gainax didn't profit from it is what made them insist on co-ownership of _Evangelion_ before they made it."

>
> "My understanding is that _Gunbuster_ was a real success, but Bandai owned _Gunbuster_, just as they owned _Honneamise_. So you might say that Gainax didn't have to deal with the massive medium-term financial loss _Honneamise_ represented (the movie eventually made its money back in September of 1994, after the LD box set release), but they also didn't profit from _Gunbuster_'s success."

I don't know if this was mentioned earlier, but I think it makes even more sense as to the fact Shinji is on a stage, and thinking, contemplating about his existence, since it seems that a large number of people (including himself?) stopped existing on the physical plane.

> Also, a bunch of friends noted that the sheet of paper that is shown shortly after the dream sequence, is the actual script of the dream sequence, and afterward, Shinji appears to be reading a book, looking up, and saying something to the effect of, "so, this is the reality" or something like that."

# Tangential materials

From the Kotaku message board from whence this post originates:

Why can't young men wed anymore? I think it is because men can no longer say to women, 'I can always protect you,' in this dog-eat-dog world of restructurings and layoffs – such words are now unreal.

Women as a result now target two groups of men: "ikemen" (handsome, cool men), and rich men, the so-called 'Hills tribe' (referring to the ultra-prestigious Roppongi Hills residential tower).

But most men have neither money nor good looks, and as a result women will no longer consider them. Surprisingly, I've heard of cases where a chosen man will end up dating dozens or hundreds of women.

Since the ikemen and the rich monopolize the women, all that remains is a sterile desert, where normal men can no longer find a partner, so they flee to Akihabara and find love in the arms of an anime character.

Girls, it seems, are suffering from a similar lack of heat: 59 percent in the same age group felt the same way, up 12 percentage points from 2008.

> In Japan, ever in the demographic forefront, as many as one out of three young adults is either unemployed or working part-time, and many are living rent-free with their parents. Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist at Tokyo Gakugei University, has sarcastically dubbed them parasaito shinguru, or "parasite singles." Adult offspring who live with their parents are common in aging Europe, too. In 2003 a report from the British Prudential financial-services group awarded the 6.8 million British in this category the mocking name of "kippers"—"kids in parents' pockets eroding retirement savings."...According to Yuji Genda, an economist at Tokyo University, the drifty lives of parasite singles are indeed a by-product of increased longevity, mainly because longer-lived seniors are holding on to their jobs. Japan, with the world's oldest population, has the highest percentage of working senior citizens of any developed nation: one out of three men over sixty-five is still on the job. Everyone in the nation, Genda says, is "tacitly aware" that the old are "blocking the door."... Japan, preoccupied by Nihonjinron (theories of "Japaneseness"), has always viewed immigrants with suspicion if not hostility. Facing potential demographic calamity, the Japanese government has spent millions trying to develop a novel substitute for immigrants: robots smart and deft enough to take care of the aged.
