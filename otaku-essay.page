Religious interpretations are not even wrong.

Evangelion is a lot of things. It is a robot romp. It is twists suggested by a lazy artist who watches too much TV and understood too little. Directed by a director who sees himself in a boy too cowardly to die. It is an excuse to copy old American cartoons and work in inscrutable allusions, for the pleasure of remembering. It was a by-the-numbers mecha series by a man who had reveled unapologetically in squalor and mecha series but wonders whether he should grow up - or *could*. It is the bitter tears of outsourced animator wage-slaves listening to the cheerful phrase 'sabisu, sabisu!' It is the product of uneasy tensions at the heart of a business founded by idealists - dreams for dollars, yearnings pure and impure for yen. Too, it is the sour conviction that mysteries must have answers, that the creators knew more than the consumers, that authors do not play dice. Perhaps it is also the story of George Lucas, who discovered that fame and wealth could be as much a trap as obscurity and poverty, that to feel accolades undeserved is to feel them turn ashes in your mouth.

# What are otaku anime?

My definition of 'otaku anime' is pretty straightforward: any anime that depicts, tries to understand, and criticizes otaku and their pursuits; bonus points if it is also very popular among otaku.

1. _Otaku no Video_: this falls under the rubric quite obviously just from the title.
     More importantly, while the animated segments show an idealized & fanciful history of Gainax (a studio founded by otaku to produce stuff for otaku), the live-action segments/interviews show the dark side of obsessive interests - people walled away from reality and other people, forever obsessed even when they seem to have built themselves a life, and deeply unhappy. I was even more horrified when I learned that some of the interviews were 'nonfiction'.
2. _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ is throughout a critique of otakudom and the old mecha genre (in exactly the opposite way that _Gurren Lagann_ is a mindless celebration).
    Anno has said that the characters represent himself; Tsurumaki has said that people who can [live and communicate normally](http://www.evaotaku.com/html/rcb-tsurumaki.html) will not benefit from watching Eva. If you don't think Anno was criticizing otakus, [these interview excerpts](http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/edito41.htm) may help. There are many lines throughout the series directed straight at fans: “We can't weave our lives only out of things we like….”, and these have been highlighted by staffers like Tsurumaki as well as commentators like myself.
3. _Serial Experiments Lain_ is similar.
     Like Eva, SEL was doing a lot, but one of the things is a similar critique - the vapidity and hollowness of a tech-oriented life and its devotees. Lain can disappear at the end without a trace, that is how meaningless her life in the simulation is, how malleable it is. If there is any thing of value in her life, it was her rare friendships - exactly the sort of thing that anti-social geeks shy away from, and exactly what Lain began to sacrifice by becoming consumed with technology and programming. (See also Eva's [hedgehog's dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog%27s_dilemma))
4. _Welcome to the N.H.K.!_
    By this point, it should be pretty obvious how NHK fits in. It is not just a 'dark comedy' - it depicts a _human wreck_. I've heard that the hallucinations in the first episode are drug-induced in the manga; our protagonist is the lowest of the low. He is sick. Fucked in the head. He is a hikkomori who throws himself into every otaku pursuit he finds, and discovers their vapidity. What does he get out of galges except endless masturbation? His next-door neighbor is his own walking zoo of pathologies, from just the toleration for derivative crap (the song playing endlessly), to his failed personal relationships, and so on.
     And what about the MMORPG playing hikkomori who has literally written the book on self-help?
     No, to write off WTTNHK as just 'dark comedy' is to willfully ignore everything else that is going on. It is not stretching to call it 'psychological', nor any of the others I've covered.

    (A related series is _[The Tatami Galaxy](!Wikipedia)_; its 10th episode begins with the protagonist defending being a hikkomori, and the time loop he is trapped in ends when he realizes the value of love.)

(One could throw in _Genshiken_ or _Comic Party_ or _Animation Runner Kuromi_ as rare otaku-focused anime/manga, but in these 3 cases, any actual criticism seems to be non-existent - if one were to judge from them, there's nothing really potentially bad about being an otaku, just people may shun you for no good reason. _Genshiken_ occasionally alludes to problems, but largely flinches away, as it just wants to celebrate & reminisce.)

# Otaku no Video
## The bright side
## the dark side

The remarkable thing about _Otaku_ is that at the breaks, it switches from the anime to short filmed videos with various otaku (Gainax staffers)

# EoE & TV are the same ending

> How does that make any sense? In the movies Shinji rejects instrumentality, in the series he embraces it. The two story lines are mutually exclusive. Or have I missed something completely? It has been a while...

I think you missed something. I've always regarded the 2 endings as complementary, not contradictory.

Obviously EoE is about external events, action; and obviously the TV is about internal events, introspection. But the TV's action matches up with EoE's action (the Misato and Ritsuko bodies, for example), so we might expect the introspection to match up as well.

I won't trouble you with excerpts from the script (as this is an old Eva argument, it's been done before and better), but go back and look at the [Episode 26 synopsis](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Episode_26#Synopsis). Notice how the whole episode is about Shinji coming to grip with how it's better to exist, and exist as a separate person. The entire series is skeptical about the value & desirability of Instrumentality:

> In fact, she and other characters say, it's true for all humanity, this weakness. It's why Instrumentality is taking place. Humans cannot live alone, but yet they are separate entities: thus conflict and pain is created. Humans cannot live but in Instrumentality. "Really?" asks the text.

Or the final moments are quite telling:

> After seeing this, Shinji realizes that there are alternate possibilities to his Shinji decides that he can learn to love himself, and he wants to be "me" and to stay "here". The dark world shatters, and Shinji is left standing atop a coral reef under a sunny sky, surrounded by most of the other characters. He is wished "Congratulations!" by the human cast (and a squawking Pen Pen), and smiles, thanking everyone.

If he's accepted Instrumentality, then who is doing the congratulating, who being congratulated, and for what?

Specific plot points aside, why would the two endings be contradictory? Most people accept that part of the reason for the TV ending's experimental techniques (or crappiness, for some) was due to budget and internal Gainax issues. Why would Anno have the budget and time to do EoE, and decide to do an ending exactly opposite the one they wanted to do but couldn't? (Don't say Anno's revenge; that is untenable) If Shakespeare could go rewrite _Hamlet_ again with an unlimited [SFX](!Wikipedia) budget, would he suddenly decide to rewrite it to have a contradictory ending (maybe one where everyone lives)? Of course not. There's a particular artistic viewpoint being expressed - it does not allow for casual flip-flops. If the TV ending really is an acceptance of Instrumentality, then it renders everything *meaningless*, all the fighting and scheming and suffering and attempts by characters to come to grips with themselves.

Or, Instrumentality is consistently pursued by SEELE - an immoral group of powerful manipulative men. Shouldn't we distrust anything sought by the likes of *them*?

'Running away' describes Instrumentality exactly; are we supposed to think, 'hey, Shinji was right all along, and not being cowardly and immature'?

Seeing both endings as rejections of Instrumentality and an embrace of reality fit exactly with the constant message of the series ('We cannot weave our lives only out of things we like'), and fits exactly the 'Eva-as-otaku-therapy' paradigm I personally subscribe to.

So: seeing the endings as covering the same end is what Occam's Razor suggests; it makes most sense artistically; it makes sense from a production standpoint; it consiles with what we understand of Anno's inspirations and pre-Eva life; it's what a straightforward plot reading suggests; and so on. (We *could* argue against or ignore all that, but I hope I've shown any such argument would be quite strained.) I feel if you rewatch with all these points in mind, you'll change your mind as well.

---


Well, it seems you have to be alive to be in Instrumentality. Consider that in EoE, we don't see Kaji or Misato or Ritsuko or Rei or anyone we know for certain to be dead after the end. We see Misato's cross nailed to a makeshift grave, suggesting Shinji is certain she's gone.

And the only other person to reform out of the LCL is Asuka, who we last saw inside a half-eaten Eva - but not dead for certain. Eva are pretty tough, and the only pilots who die are ones who activate the self-destruct or whose capsules are pulled out and *then* crushed. It doesn't seem implausible that the harpies munching on Eva-02 caused Asuka extraordinary suffering but didn't actually manage to kill her before they became busy helping Shinji start Third Impact. (It is worth noting that we see most characters become LCL, and that even characters who don't seem to become LCL probably do. Misato is visited by a Rei apparition a split-second before being blown up. Gendo is chomped in half by image of Eva-01 and not apparently turned into LCL, but *is* turned into LCL and 'a particle of red light' in [drafts of EoE](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Resources:End_of_Evangelion_Screenplays#Episode_26.27).)

In the TV series, we don't see the external results, so we can't point to the ending. But definitely in the TV (and maybe EoE, I forget), the images of Misato/Rei/etc. specifically say that they are the public personas, the masks, the versions of them inside Shinji's mind, the Misatos that he knows - and not the 'real' ones. Hence, there's no mystery how people like Kaji could show up at the Congratulations!, as his mind can work off memories.

(On a side-note, one of the interesting things about Eva is that there may *not* be anything like an eternal soul! Yes, surprisingly, for all the mention of souls, Eva/Anno seem to use the term more or less interchangeably with mortal minds. There's never any real suggestion of an afterlife for souls, and Yui's desire to make an eternal mark or monument to humanity doesn't make much sense if souls were eternal. Further, the additional backstory added by the 'Secret Information' of the PS2 game is very atheistic - Lilith and Adam are just [panspermia](!Wikipedia) projects set up by ancient aliens.)

So, who is being congratulated? Shinji. Who is congratulating him? The personas in his mind, perhaps, or maybe Instrumentality itself, or maybe his mother (Yui is almost always off-screen, yet her concern that Shinji grow up and deal with his issues still comes through loud and clear in her characterization), or maybe himself in general. It isn't clear & doesn't really matter (none of those choices affects the meaning, I think) - the point is that Shinji has made the right choice, the choice that isn't running away, the choice that will let him walk by himself into whatever future there is, the choice that isn't fleeing into an anime-like fantasy world (again, the Eva-as-otaku-therapy theory works perfectly), that isn't weaving his life only out of things he likes. Where is he being congratulated? That's pretty clearly in his head. The floating island is unreal, even if we ignore EoE's depiction of a ruined bloody world.

# Eva is meaningless
> I'll give you a simpler Occam's Razor: Anno went off the deep end, and he ruined what otherwise was a good series; in fact, what could have been one of the greatest anime series ever.

I don't really see how that's a simpler hypothesis: you're proposing that a radical one-time change (Anno going off the deep end for just the TV ending) is simpler than the null hypothesis (Anno tried to do the same thing in both works)?

And I don't entirely think the ending makes sense on a plot level. The whole Angels business is ill thought out. The creators are constantly dancing and [retconning](!Wikipedia "retroactive continuity") in the series and movies, trying to make the plot-level hold together. And the plot is ultimately too shallow to bear the weight people put on it; one is done an disservice, almost, by essays and articles that lead with a plot summary. It's not the Angels or fights, as interesting and well-done as they may be, that are the raison d'etre of NGE, but what happens between and because of the Angels and fights; they occasion the events we care about. "..ultimately, the plot of Evangelion wasn't very interesting", writes one fan.[^weise]

TODO: move this to the end: [^weise]: ["Saving What Counts: Reflections on the End of Eva"](http://www.abcb.com/eva/essay_02.htm), Matthew Weise, 16 November 1999:

     > "The supposed "real" ending of Eva, the movie, is what it took to make me realize exactly what it was that the show did right. The movie gives you the labyrinthine plot that Evangelion was building up to and ironically proves that, ultimately, the plot of Evangelion wasn't very interesting. The pop-theology and religious name-dropping that the series liked to indulge so much in are brought to the foreground resulting in total chaos, with the ideology of the series being splintered into a thousand pieces as characters are bent and twisted to conform to the plot which ends on a note of glaring philosophical pretense. In retrospect, the series finale of Eva seems wise to simply forego its narrative and opt for the exact material that the movies failed to address: the individual anxieties of the human beings involved in a familiar, real world context.

They fail, of course; the 'Secret Information' plot data from the PS2 game even finally admits that some of the Angels were headed for Lilith, some for Adam, and some had no plan in mind - which is a transparently failed plot. Anno had a good deal to do with the SI, so I take that section as him basically saying 'the explanation is that there is no explanation; stop obsessing about it'.

So in that sense it doesn't translate well onto celluloid. The simple approach would simply be to write an essay on how it's painful to exist, quote some Buddhism, some existentialism, and maybe Schopenhauer on the Hedgehog's Dilemma. But would that speak to otaku? No, not really. It might speak to philosophers, but they wouldn't need such an essay. How do you animate those ideas, get people to relate to them? How would you put those ideas into character form, what sort of story do you write?

Why then am I so interested in a failure? Because while it's a failure on the level of straight mecha - a series like RahXephon is infinitely better as mecha, or the better Gundams are clearly superior even if Eva can boast novel organic mecha designs - it's most definitely not a failure on the psychological/philosophical levels. In my other comments I mention my Eva-as-otaku-therapy theory. What Eva does so brilliantly is diagnose the otaku condition (the alienation, the apathy, the unhappiness and pain of it), how it is the general human condition, and the painful solution. It does so throughout the series, and does so thoroughly while creating characters that *last*. (What other characters from 1995 are so memorable and vital 14 years later? Why do Rei/Misato/Asuka capture their archetypes so perfectly?) The poison slides into the otaku stomach pleasantly, with plenty of fan service, until suddenly the ill-adjusted otaku realizes he is on the couch with Anno hm-hming.

Other Gainax series are like this: _Otaku no Video_ for example mixes its glorification of otaku with disconcerting video segments; FLCL is another. Outside of Gainax, therapy anime are rare but often quite good; _Serial Experiments Lain_ and _Welcome to the N.H.K.!_ come to mind. (_Genshiken_ does not; it whitewashes and glorifies otaku with only token criticisms.)

If your time was wasted watching it, then perhaps you should feel *glad* about that - glad that you didn't need it. (Some people do; remember the ['Death threats'](http://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats)? Read the translations and note how many of them speak of how the viewer saw themselves in Eva; consider why they sent them, and why Gainax selected them to be shown.)

### EoE: Anno's Revenge
<http://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats>

The initial reaction to EoE is bafflement. The viewer is repulsed when Shinji masturbates to a comatose Asuka. NERV staffers are butchered, non-combatants massacred. The montages are explicit and disturbing. Misato's kiss of Shinji either incestuous or pedophilia. Asuka's defeat is gory & wince-inducing. Ritsuko simply fails and is shot out of hand, the viewer deprived of any closure. (What *did* Gendo say to her?) Some scenes are simply obscene - when Eva 01 thrusts out of the giant Rei's eye, with all the eyeball-fluid spilling that implies, I simply had to look away. The rotting Rei chunks that set the background for the last scene are eery. The ending is famously inclusive; we know nothing of what will happen to Asuka & Shinji now and it's unclear what connection there is to the TV ending (which might have confused us, but the 'Congratulations!' thing at least fits some sort of ending pattern).

We might be bothered by other aspects. The occasional live-action sequence with 3 Japanese women/girls staring at us, the enigmatic dream-playground sequence (just to cite one), what's really going on - all these seem to defy a coherent analysis. Not for nothing has Eva its reputation of being a labyrinth in which fans are devoured by the minotaur of obsession.

This almost seems deliberate. Indeed, any viewer could see this, so surely the man who conceived it and executed it must see how unacceptable this all is. But he did it anyway. Why? Anno must be deliberately seeking to displease the viewer. Why? Well...

We search for a motive, and we find that the end of the TV was greeted with a firestorm. It was nothing like anyone had expected, nor did they understand what they had gotten. As the quip about academia goes, the smaller the stakes the more vicious the fights. Even better, EoE supplies a ready-made reason for Anno to want to punish viewers: shots of death threat graffiti and email ("Anno, I'll kill you!!!").

Case closed, then? Death threats are quite serious and from what I know of Japan, even rarer than in America. One could forgive a man for being disturbed and angered that his work could excite homicidal hatred.

But then, the graffiti and email weren't the only material depicted. There were a good 24 frames flashed, with about 11 or 12 different responses.

Consider letter 1. It is displayed 3 times in varying formats, and reads in part:

> I'm a middle school student like Shinji. First of all, I saw Eva and now it seems like I truly recognize myself, and this feeling is because of Eva. I want to say thank you for this. Why do I say this? To explain it would take a while, but Shinji and I are alike; depressed and helpless and introverted. I remember watching Eva and seeing Shinji being worried and troubled and I felt the same in my heart. In "EVA", there was an analysis that said how Shinji couldn't run away from the pain or the unpleasant feelings that were attached, and I have felt like this way too....
> In the last scene on TV, Shinji accepts everyone and they all congratulate him; that was a very nice end and I felt very happy....
> I'm worried about what will happen to Shinji in the movie (but I like the last scene on the TV series a lot). And thanks to EVA, I've started like myself and that has made me very happy....Mr. Anno, please keep working on EVA a lot more....and thank you so much for everything!!

Or the second letter:

> I also felt inside myself the same excitement that Shinji felt. The last scenes made me appreciate my own existence even more.

Letter three:

> Thanks to Mr. Anno and all the staff for helping to liberate our hearts and souls, and for all of these feelings. Thank you very much.

Another letter:

> Shinji's falls into despair and Asuka's arrogance appears to be some sort of escape from the darkness in her heart. These people have difficulties in dealing with their feelings; and so in their own ways -- Shinji by totally collapsing and falling apart, and Asuka by letting her arrogance cover up her inner weakness -- they each work towards the same goal: to come to terms with themselves.

One last one:

> I could feel the pain of the TV series again. I could feel inside my heart the feelings inside Hideaki Anno's heart. So in my heart, I sympathized with "I'm not alone. To feel loneliness is better." I still feel a strange sensation even after watching the movie, because of these two opposite feelings mixing in myself. I'm waiting for the summer to see "End of Evangelion", and I know that that will be even more painful, but I will feel happy and enjoy it. I don't think that there are many people who feel this way, but in my case, EVA made me think about myself and was like a mirror of myself.

Think about what Anno chose to show. Of the many thousands of messages they must have received, he chose to show 4 times one from a depressed student like Shinji who has come to feel better about himself; another who identified with Shinji; a message of gratitude simply for the healing; some analysis of the psychological issues of the 2 most important characters; an analysis & application to himself; and some death threats.

Is it more plausible that Anno was so angered by the 2 death threats that he abandoned whatever vision he had, than that the 2 threats were chosen to be contrasts with the others?

Most of the messages were healthy responses. The writer grew or learned in some way. Eva was not mere entertainment for them.

The death threats were pathological responses; to care that much about Eva, one must be deeply attracted to it, sense that it says something about oneself. I could not care less about whether some [telenovela](!Wikipedia) series goes off the rails, because it says nothing to me; but if I were watching a series that I identified deeply with, that I felt expressed the things I valued as no series before had, and by the end, it had called my life a crippled shell, my ideals hollow and false, and urged me to become something else entirely before it was too late, something I have spent years eluding - then a equally deep sense of betrayal is to be expected. There is no apathetic response to such a challenge. Either the viewer can accept the diagnosis and strive for healing, or he can reject it utterly. A therapist is always in danger from his patient.

# Why the plot is unimportant

Let's not mince words: Eva's plot is incoherent. There is no getting around this. One of the most frequent assessments is that it is post-modern in its eclecticism, or that it is "the remix anime":

> "Evangelion carries a large number of quotes from and references to other anime productions, such as the mecha designs of Ultraman, Space Battleship Yamato, and Gundam. The works of Go Nagai – such as Mazinga Z – and even the novelist Ryu Murakami are also referred to; in particular, Devilman is seen as a major source for the overall plot. This was so apparent that Evangelion became known as "the remixed anime". pg 9 of Fujie 2004

It is comprised of hoary tropes and devices from earlier mecha and fiction in general; the subversions have been often remarked upon & considered to be what is important (eg. Napier), but even more were played straight (consider the list of identified elements by TvTropes <http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeonGenesisEvangelion> and how many of them are *not* subversions) Anno is explicit about this recycling:

> "There is no longer room for absolute originality in the field of anime, especially given that our generation was brought up on mass-produced anime. All stories and techniques inevitably bring with them a sense of déjà vu. The only avenue of expression left open to us is to produce a collage-like effect based on a sampling of existing works."  Fujie 2004

The level of recycling can be seen in comparison with another mecha series: _RahXephon_ (2002). The similarities are so numerous that anyone who has seen them both must remark on them <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RahXephon#Neon_Genesis_Evangelion> and the similarities can be traced down scene-by-scene (see <http://evaxephon.com/> ) but many of the similarities are drawing on common sources: _Megazone 23_ for the false Tokyo, _Yamato_ for the alien invasion, _Devilman_ for the cosmic conflict and vague souls and humanity's inferiority

> The overall design of Evangelion calls to mind Devilman by Go Nagai. In fact, the whole concept of the Evas, which are made from Adam, and harbor the souls of humans, can be considered borrowed from scenes from Devilman, where the soul of Akira Fudo is possessed by Amon, the Lord of War. Moreover, the heavily religious undertones, the suggestion of conflict with an indigenous people, and the cosmic view that mankind may not be the ultimate being all owe something to Devilman." pg 76 of Fujie 2004

and so on. Even an incomplete list of allusions & borrowings runs into the dozens. In this respect, Eva is reminiscent of the first Gainax videos, the [DAICON](!Wikipedia) convention videos; the videos include literally hundreds of characters and decades after their production, many remain unidentified (see one attempt to catalogue & identify them by going frame-by-frame <http://www.anime-classic.net/AC/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=DaiconWiki> )
Who could possibly appreciate such a work? Only a fellow otaku. To have not seen the relevant predecessors is to be unable to watch Eva fully. It would be like reading Shakespeare or Milton while utterly ignorant of classical history & myth. Something will come through, but how much?
Many subcultures prize works that are obscure to outsiders. Shibboleths keep the rabble out. By making Eva inscrutable to your average TV watcher, Anno speaks to the otaku alone and receives their attention. If you think Eva was popularly understandable, then why is Anno so concerned to 'dumb down', as it were, the _Rebuild_ fans?

> "As the creator of this project, [I assure you that] a very new-feeling Evangelion world has been constructed. For this purpose, we are not returning to our roots at Gainax.... In closing, it is also our job to provide a service to our customers. Although it seems obvious, we aim to create a form of entertainment that anyone can look forward to; one that people who have never seen Evangelion can easily adjust to, one that can engage audiences as a movie for theatres, and one that produces a new understanding of the world."^[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies]

The subversion of tropes is not necessarily important. Many of the subversions or twists were already done. Shinji, for example, is far from the first reluctant or mentally disturbed mecha pilot - consider the pilots in _Space Runaway Ideon_, or <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamille_Bidan> in the 2nd Gundam - nor would he be the last (every other Gundam series). The important thing is that the audience knows where the creator is coming from, that quotes like "His erudition in [tokusatsu](!Wikipedia) is vast, and can be seen clearly in his animation work." are not PR fluff. That he remains one of them.

> "[Anno's] Primary diet consists of Sapporo Brand Barbecue Potato Chips and pizza with tomatoes as the only topping. After those comes beer. His erudition in tokusatsu is vast, and can be seen clearly in his animation work." - from the Gainax FAQ <http://www.cjas.org/~leng/daihist.htm>

The plot exists as a convenience to reach the necessary situations, and to earn otaku cred. Once the otaku have taken the bait and invested something of themselves in the series (think how hard it is to not finish a book you are half-way through), it is unnecessary, and almost abandoned by the last 2 episodes.

## The Un-Evas

We can convince ourselves further that the plot isn't important by looking at RahXephon. RX unquestionably had better animation; its music is competitive with Eva's; the critical response uniformly positive; the plot well-thought out from the beginning (with some critics specifically praising it as a "paragon of responsible storytelling (...) No loose strings are left; we see the conclusion of every character's storyline." <http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=566> ); its Mesoamerican style quite as exotic as the Judeo-christian symbolism in Eva; its goals apocalyptic, and so on. In many respects, it is RX and not Eva which deserves to be remembered and rewatched.

And yet - it was popular enough to merit a quasi-movie & a manga adaptation, but no more. When brought up by fans, discussion often centers (just as here) on its relation to Eva. Its influence on post-2002 anime indiscernible. No revival seems to be in the cards. Why? Why does it not have a cult following, or even any mindshare? (I see online obscure series like _Texhnolyze_ recommended long before anyone dredges RX from the depths.)

Another contrast might be the later Gainax work _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ (2007). Lagann is like Eva in being a mecha series focusing on a young orphan boy piloting an extraordinarily powerful mecha, but it shuns any thinking deeper than sloganeering ("Go beyond the impossible, and kick reason to the curb!"), and is content with being a collage anime which takes all the shonen mecha tropes and pushes them to their limits. I would call it satire, but that implies some desire for change, and the series is done with such affection & good humour that it is only ever entertaining. Lagann was, of course, a massive hit among otaku. (See also later Melancholy section)

I suggest that Eva represented a peculiar & perhaps unique mix of otaku catnip and psychological '[earworms](!Wikipedia "Earworm")' - analyses that pierce an otaku's heart, that he can't forget, that he circles around and must keep coming back to again and again ("”Eva" is a story that repeats..." <http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/hideaki-anno-releases-statement-about-new-evangelion-movies>).

> "Even as contemporary youth are encouraged to become familiar with information technologies (IT), the impacts of those technologies on their well-being have been the subject of increasing concern. Youth subcultures heavily engaged with IT have often been portrayed as victims of alienation, as having abandoned traditional values, and/or as being more likely to commit acts of violence. This study seeks to characterize and demystify a youth subculture of extreme/obsessive enthusiasts known as otaku who are heavy users of information technology and are focused strongly on the acquisition and trade of elite information."

> In fact, I believe that this line is a direct reference to a brief scene contained only in the Japanese home video version of Evangelion TV episode 22. In this sequence that which was never broadcast on Japanese television and is not included in the American Evangelion DVDs, Asuka faces herself in the bathroom mirror and says, in translation:
>
>> “Kimochi warui. Who wants to bathe in the same water that Misato and stupid Shinji have bathed in? Who wants to use a washing machine that Misato and stupid Shinji have washed their underwear in? Who wants to sit on a toilet that Misato and stupid Shinji have used? Who wants to breath the same air as Misato and stupid Shinji?”
>
> In this sequence, Asuka essentially says that she is sickened and disgusted by the idea of sharing herself with others; the knowledge that other people exist and have an effect on her. In effect, with this tremendously important sequence, Asuka reveals herself as the antithesis of Shinji and the opposite thematic pole of the Evangelion animation. Throughout the Evangelion animation Shinji is torn between his fear of human relations and companionship and his natural desire for affection, acknowledgment and acceptance. Shinji wants to belong. On the other hand, Asuka is disgusted by social relations and other people. She tries to force herself into interpersonal relationships by kissing Shinji, but even that fails. While Shinji represents the desire for companionship; Asuka represents the desire for isolation.

# Positive otakudom
## Haruhi

This theory is extensible further. One might wonder why _Haruhi_ was so extraordinarily popular when it came out. One can appeal to surface features, which exist in abundance. Haruhi is a well-designed character; her sidekicks are the epitome of moe or a fresh twist on the passive Rei archetype. The storyline is thoughtful, postmodern without being obnoxious, and often funny. The anime has a famously excellent opening, and the animation in general is top-notch. The voice actors nail their roles. The episode sequence is unique, and represents an ingenious work-around the source novels (I argue in [anime endings] that the 'Haruhi' random ordering creates a sensible dramatic arc). Kyon is himself a carefully modulated narrator, sarcastic without being negative, representing the viewer yet not too close. There was an existing fan-base from the light novels; the season had little competition. In general, everything went right. One should expect a fair degree of popularity.

But there's something missing there. When we compound our previous ingredients, the stew is insipid. What's the missing ingredient? It's the *optimism*. It's the sense of fun and wonder (the '[sensawunda](!Wikipedia "sense of wonder")'^[See also [Everything2](http://everything2.com/title/sensawunda)'s entry or [Bookslut's](http://www.bookslut.com/science_fiction_skeptic/2007_12_012076.php) description.] as  [A.E. Vogt](!Wikipedia) put it). The world is stranger than you imagine, but not in a despairing Lovecraftian way. The love of weirdness for its own sake, the search for novelty, these form the core of 'Haruhiism'. Haruhi's club wears its mission on its sleeve (or name, rather): "The *S*ave the world by *O*verloading it with fun: *S*uzumiya Haruhi's Brigade, abbreviated as SOS Brigade."^[Chapter 2, _[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](http://webcitation.org/5hPv6qbVn)_ (volume 1)]

This is not the usual critical otaku narrative that we saw in _Evangelion_ or in _Welcome to the N.H.K._. There, we realize the sterility of otaku pursuits. Consider dating games: the endless permutations of hair style and eye color, even the doujinshi wearily pairing off the protagonist with each girl in the standard variations of sex, the fanart putting a particular character through its paces: in a _yukata_ watching fireworks, in a bathrobe at the _onsen_, hanging out on the school roof, etc. The combinations are monstrous. Where are we to find soul or meaning in the Library of Borges?

A fan has an essentially closed universe. He has abdicated his freedom to strike off on his own in new directions. He is one of many, but still alone: the esthetic experience is still alone. He may hide his unhappiness, may throw himself into his pursuits, but he is still empty. The many critiques of modern man apply to him in double measure. He is no New Type.

This sad truth isn't always the truth. There are fans who are empowered to do new things. One thinks of the early works of Gainax, the DAICON videos. There's love in every frame of them, excitement at something new. Consider _Otaku no Video_: we can see despair in the live-action segments, particularly in the segment about the video collector. But the animated segments offer us hope: salvation through creation. The 2 protagonists are not damned by their otaku life; they overcome it to become true fans, Otakings, creators of a commercial empire, and if we take the ending literally, they helm humanity's expansion to the stars - the dream of generations.

In a way, computers were the worst thing that ever happened to otaku. They made it tremendously easy to link up with other fans and plunge deeply into multiple communities, sapping fans of the will to do anything in particular. Is it an accident that the decline of the Space Age was just before the rise of the Personal Computer Age? If we had looked forward, we would have expected computers to help us travel to Mars and beyond. After all, as the old comment goes, we went to the Moon on the equivalent of a wrist-watch; how much more could we do with modern computers! Yet we are no longer even on the Moon. The ISS is already within sight of its final orbit. We contract. We become ever more introverted. Why bother with outer space, when we have inner space? An inner space/Internet exploding in detail, becoming ever more sophisticated and addictive. If Gainax were founded today, would its animators create whole shorts multiple minutes long, or would they be doing mashups of _Lucky Star_ with _Death Note_ to put on YouTube?

Haruhi wants the SOS-dan to go out and change the world. To make it more interesting - not to make a more interesting webpage. To have fun, and search for strange beings. That we are not gods who warp the world into possessing strange beings does not make Haruhi any less inspirational. When one watches a video of _Haruhi_ fans waiting on a line spontaneously doing the dance and instantly stopping when a quizzical policeman walks by, this is the spirit of Haruhiism at work. When large red Hs appear mysteriously, this is Haruhiism too. When Improv Everywhere stages another mass event - they may never have heard of Haruhi, but that is Haruhiism too. When hackers discover some vibrators hooked up to a compass grant one a 6th sense, is this not Haruhiism too? When SpaceX launches a rocket into space - and not a social network site into an IPO - is this not Haruhiism too?

# Analysis

re: suicide; Shinji hangs out at a 'famous suicide site'? see also 'what were we trying to make', "A cowardly young man who feels that his father has abandoned him, and so he has convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person, so much so that he cannot even commit suicide."

> I think it's just something he wanted to acknowledge, the same way he acknowledges at various points that this is an anime, and people are watching this anime. There's a scene in LOVE & POP with an actor dressing as Anno famously did, that is resonant with the masturbation scene in THE END OF EVANGELION, I think.

> In fact, I don't think I'm reading anything about religion into Evangelion, so much as simply pointing out what the series already contains in this scene, and that scene, and...If Gainax was really concerned about people misinterpreting the religious elements in Eva after the TV series aired, they had a strange way of showing it when they made EoE, because the film ratchets these things up tremendously.
> In fact, an interesting way of describing the difference between the TV and the film ending is that the TV ending not only lacks the action and apocalypse, it also lacks the religious tone and iconography of EoE. Certainly Evangelion can be viewed as a psychological analysis, but I would argue from that perspective, the TV ending is the more "relevant" one, because it relies more or less entirely on human discussion, reflection, and analysis, rather than apocalyptic spectacle.

> Among all 26 episodes of the TV version of "Neon Genesis Evangelion", Director Anno himself wrote the scripts for five episodes, and is credited jointly with other screenwriters for the scripts of 20 episodes. The number of scripts that were jointly credited are the definitive drafts of scripts based on plots by director Anno written by screenwriters and gone over directly by director Anno. The only time where director Anno's name isn't credited for a script is episode 4 "Rain, after escaping (Hedgehog's Dilemma)" based on a plot by Mr. Satsukawa. Just by looking at these numbers, you will understand how much director Anno pulled the series together by his personal authorship.

pretty conclusive arguments that Misato wanted to have sex with Shinji

Misato really did try to do Shinji in episode 23
<http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?t=445>
' it is a fact that this is a plot element that was crucial to the story as a whole, and one that Anno set us up for, right from the get-go (the picture Misato used to lure Shinji in #01: "Look at this!" [arrow points at cleavage], and, of course, in #02, "It's not like I'm going to 'put the moves' on a kid!")
'Secondly, it's not like Misato's little self-implicating 'joke' is the only time that Anno utilizes the 'Ironic Foreshadowing' trick; there are plentiful other examples, such as Toji saying "I guess only weirdos get to be Eva pilots" . EoE is a parade of one brutally ironic pay-off after another...'
'Want an example? I asked Takeshi Honda what working under Anno was like at Katsucon 2004. He said it was very stressful because Anno made numerous last minute changes. For example, episode 24 was supposed to be about Shinji confronting Yui's presence in the Eva, not his relationship with Kaworu Nagisa.
'I was just thinking that Aaron has a good point when he reminds us not to view EVA as a perfectly thought-out work. Gainax doesn't think of its works as being perfectly thought-out--I say that because a lot of creators
think they think things out thoroughly--Gainax knows they don't. I'm reminded of a comment Toshio Okada made at Otakon 1995 about GIANT ROBO, saying that it was the kind of anime Gainax would have made, but GR's creators "do not have our confusion." '
'
EVA is suffused in sexuality, from fan-service teasing to the real thing. It was designed that way--Gainax are otaku, after all (according to Lea Hernandez, in the late 80s head of their U.S. merchandising division General Products, Gainax judged the success of GUNBUSTER by its doujinshi). But I also agree that to identify Misato as a pedophile is a little strange, if only because she doesn't seem especially oriented towards underaged men. '

> Umm... that particular checkpoint at the bottom of Newtype TV filmbook #9 p25 has a big "maybe" attached.  This is not the usual "appears" or "seems", but instead an explicit "maybe" (ka mo shirenai).
>
> The literal translation is:
>
>> "Misato stretched out her hand to Shinji.  At this time she may have intended to offer her body to comfort Shinji.  However, this was merely substitutive behavior in order to assuage her own loneliness."

Cardass cards: <http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/oldeva/2001-September/040387.html>
> The gold foil side shows Shinji and Misato dressed up and sharing cocktails in a club.  However, the title is Misato's EoE line: "That's a grownup kiss. We'll do the rest when you get back." and the info text is fairly straightforward:
>
>> "While fighting the Angels together, the two began to view each other not just as Tactical Operations Chief and pilot, but in a special way.  Older sister and younger brother, mother and son, girl and boy... but the two did not notice/realize the word used to express these feelings (this relationship?).  However, time would teach them, just as it had fostered the relationship between them."


> Ideon ends with humanity dying and merging with "life/Id" to form a perfect entity - and in the final moments of the final episode, they sing  "Happy Birthday"
>
> The Eva Cardass Masters card states:
>
>> "In the sea of LCL, Shinji wished for a world with other people. He desired to meet them again, even if it meant he would be hurt and betrayed.  And just as he had hoped/wanted, Asuka was present in the new world.  Only Asuka was there beside him. The girl whom he had hurt, and who had been hurt by him. But even so, she was the one he had hoped/wished for...."

> Further,  Cardass Drama card D-88 states, "Shinji renounced the world where all hearts had melted into one and accepted each other unconditionally." The following presents the definitive answer to this question, as translated by Bochan Bird -

>> "Shinji renounced the world where all hearts had melted into one and accepted each other unconditionally. His desire... to live with 'others' -- other hearts that would sometimes reject him, even deny him. That is why the first thing he did after coming to his senses was to place his hands around Asuka's neck. To feel the existence of an 'other'. To confirm (make sure of) rejection and denial."

> 'Although Maya looks up to Ritsuko as her "sempai", there was clearly an intention to portray Maya's feelings towards Ritsuko as something much more complicated with deliberate gay overtones.

Cards are untrustworthy?

> I think some clarification is necessary for people not familiar with the card game. The double sided Hokan cards (translated as "Instrumentality Cards" in the game rules I've read) have a special goal for the player to achieve. For instance, there is a "Asuka gets Shinji" card, a "Rei gets Shinji" card, a "Shinji reconciles with Gendo" card etc. These cards and the text on them could be seen as alternate possibilities of what could happen. Like fanfiction, the text in these cards seem to give a plausible justification for each ending. With that in mind, the characterizations in these cards should be taken with a grain of salt.

## Soul of Eva-03

> As for his sister, I think NERV had already put his sister soul in EVA-03. Reason? Think of why Touji's sister was transferred to NERV's hospital? NERV wanted it so. Did you see all human pilot requires his/her EVA to hold the soul of a female who is very close to the pilot? Touji's mom was dead long time ago, who is the best candidate to "donate" the soul??? In fact, Ritsuko said something to that effect when she mentioned why Touji (whose name was not disclosed at that point) was chosen as the 4th children. Misato showed her disgust, but couldn't help it.

ep 04:
Gendo:  According to the Malduck Organization's report, the Fourth Children
        has yet to be found.
ep 17:

NurseC: Yeah.
        He never misses visiting twice a week.
        He's a very good brother, thinking so much about his sister.
...
Ritsuko: The Dummy plug is still too dangerous.
        One of the present candidates will be...

Gendou: appointed as the Fourth.

Ritsuko:Yes.
        There's one child whose core will be ready immediately.

Gendou: I'll leave all of it to you.

Ritsuko:Yes.
...
Ritsuko: In the booting test of Unit three at Matsushiro,
        we will use the Fourth as the pilot.

Misato: The Fourth?
        The fourth children was found?

Ritsuko: Yesterday.

Misato: I haven't received a report from the Marduk Institute yet.

Ritsuko:The official documents will arrive tomorrow.

Misato: Dr. Akagi, are you keeping secrets from me, again?

Ritsuko:No, nothing.

Misato: Well, OK.
        And, who is the selected child?

Misato: Wow, it's THIS child?

Ritsuko:We had no choice.
        The candidates have been gathered in one place,
        and are being protected.
...
Misato: I don't care at all what people say about me.
        I'm not feeling very reserved at the moment.
        The Fourth children was found just in time.
        What is the hidden reason for that?

Ryouji: I'll tell you one thing.

Ryouji: Marduk Institute does not exist.
        Nerv alone is pulling the strings.

Misato: Nerv alone?
        Commander Ikari?

ep 18:
Misato: Yea, I know...  So, when will the pilot be called?

Ritsuko: It's gonna be tomorrow, since there are still
         preparations to be made.

Misato: The pilot may tell him about it by himself.

Ritsuko: That's impossible.  He wasn't happy enough to brag about it.
        The condition he made was to transfer his little sister to the
        headquarters' medical unit.

ep 19:
Touji:    Why don't you tell my sister that there's nothing serious
            wrong with me?

Hikari:   Uh huh.
...
Shinji:   Tell me one thing;
          Why was it Touji...  the Fourth Child-REN...?

Misato:   The fourth level candidates are all your classmates.
          I just learned that recently, too.
          It was all contrived.

Shinji:   Everyone, everyone in the class...

Note: there seems to be no interaction between Hikari & Suzuhara except for ep 22: 'Hikari : Asuka too [is absent]. Suzuhara is still in the hospital.' Is this evidence for or against Suzuhara's little sister being dead?

Even more importantly, in Rebuild 2.0, Suzuhara's sister is alive and well and sound of mind (with a disgustingly cute photo proving it). At least there the mystery doesn't exist, implying it's a bloody hole in the plot or that they're finally abandoning the mother-core linkage.

# holes in eva

Way to completely give yourself an out there. Yes, you can handwave away any plot holes by arguing ‘but it's all about the psychology!'

On the objective plot level, Eva is holier than swiss cheese.

The core-Children-soul system makes absolutely no sense and is violated at a whim (whose soul is in unit 0? or unit 03? or the Mass Production Evas?); the Angels are according to the Confidential Information quite literally acting at random; key moments are simply omitted (what *did* Gendo say to Ritsuko and why did Ritsuko betray him? We've been arguing that one for decades.) such as basically everything happening in real life in episodes 25 and 26; the whole backstory about Adam and Lilith and Seeds of Life and the First Ancestral Race is glossed over (assuming it even existed at the time of the TV series); the motives behind Yui's plot to use Eva 01 are underexplained to say the least (if you want a monument to humanity, shoot off some space probes!); evidence from Gainax insiders and deleted scenes suggest that some connection to _Wings of Honneamise_ was intended, but nothing came of that; the 2 endings are so different that most take them as endorsing the exact opposite things (tell me, if you were watching a TV series and a movie of _Schindler's List_ and one ends with Schindler realizing the greatness of the Nazis and the sickening evil of the Jews, and the other ends with him heroically rescuing a few hundred Jews and leaving with them, wouldn't you wonder at least a *little* about how coherent the plot is?), Kaworu is a complete cipher who goes from being flatout gay in the drafts to being a nonentity (from, of course, his original monster-of-the-day description in the Proposal as a human-cat pair) – oh my god, I can't go on.

At least I don't have to criticize the religious parts because you describe them as ‘dodgy' (an understatement of Eva-sized magnitudes. Incidentally, how big *is* an Eva…?).

Maybe the reason Eva doesn't litter the TV Tropes page is because the errors and problems are that unique to Eva – it'd be like going through Hegel and trying to figure out what exact fallacies his nonsense is based on: you couldn't do it because it's nonsense writ large with so many problems and unique pathologies that your usual roster of ‘non sequitur' and ‘ad hominem' labels just aren't up to the job.


Because I think writing off all the plot holes as just annoying things is entirely wrong. I'm not resting my case on continuity issues like Shinji's plugsuit in an entry plug or Eva sizes varying from scene to scene; these are fundamental holes in the Eva world and plot. These issues leave characters undefined, acting in mysterious and inexplicable ways. We don't understand Ritsuko because of these issues. We don't have a full picture of Gendo. Yui and Kaworu are ciphers. Errors in the original mean that fans are convinced Misato killed Kaji until Gainaxers specifically deny this, insert extra scenes to reduce the impression, and Sadamoto lengthens Kaji's death to make clear it wasn't Misato. Asuka gets a whole bunch of new scenes in the Director's Cut/_Death_ to make her closer to what she was supposed to be. The 2 endings appear contradictory in the most important and fundamental way possible. And so on.

If these are not plot holes, then I have to ask – what is? Would a hypothetical scene in which Shinji walked onto the bridge and blew away the bridge bunnies finally trip your annoyance criteria and become a plot hole?

If nothing in the series does, and you can't think of any changes which would, then I submit that you simply don't want to see any plot holes and you are being intellectually dishonest in making a distinction between plot holes and ‘annoyances'.

I like Eva criticism, and I like most of yours, but intellectually honesty is not optional.

> Your theory why the tv tropes page on plot holes is interesting, if more complicated than the idea that the would be holes are less damaging to a viewer's appreciation or enjoyment (unless perhaps, the viewer is as discerning as you).

Yes, well, the fact that I think there are plot holes to be found implies that I think there's a coherent plot to begin with, which a great many anime fans would disagree with! So if there is a coherent plot to be found and I see it and they don't, then I must therefore be more discerning than that mass of disliking-fans.

Also, I'd point out that Gainax is old and experienced, and full of otaku; we should not expect any *obvious*, common, already-named-by-TVTropes plot holes, no more than we would expect to find an arithmetic error in Newton or Gauss or Terence Tao.

> Calling Yui & Kaworu ciphers is ridiculous when it was clearly pointed out throughout the show that she was the driving force behind Gendo's action

No, that means *Gendo* is not a cipher. How is Yui explained by pointing out that Gendo's rebellion against SEELE is prompted by a desire to unite with her in an Instrumentality (somehow) different from SEELE's?

She is not. What were her goals? Was the outcome of EoE to her satisfaction? (What *was* the outcome of EoE, is presupposed…) Why did she seek such an outcome? (Let's assume that she did. She says so little she might be unhappy with it, but whatever.) Did Gendo know? How does Shinji tie into it all?

It's all a mess. Yui is left as this mysterious entity that helps Shinji and attacks people and things at apparently random times. She is ‘empty' (the etymology of ‘cipher') of comprehensibility.

All of these are mysteries about Yui. One of the reasons I look forward to Rebuild 3 and 4 is that Yui's goals and motivations seem to be wrapped up with the First Ancestral Race backstory, and the FAR are strongly signaled to be directly involved by 2.0.

> Kaworu definitely had an impact on Shinji, how could he not when he crushed something that appeared human for the first time. Something that had been more genuine and honest with him than any human he'd encountered in his whole pitiful life. Drafts have little bearing to most people once they've seen a final product. That's why we proofread & professionals have editors. Because from your mind to paper to other people's reality, things can really get f*cked up.

And as with Yui – yes, he had an impact. I'm not comparing Yui or Kaworu to something which could be completely removed from Eva with no bad impact, like Pen-Pen. (As fun as he is, Eva could've gotten his humor elsewise.) I'm saying that his actions and personality are mysterious and incomprehensible.

Why did SEELE send him in the first place? Why make him in the first place? Was a Kaworu+Adam Impact acceptable to them? Why did Kaworu give up when he saw Lilith as opposed to, say, turning around and tearing NERV apart until he found Gendo? (For that matter, why does it matter in the least that he found Lilith? He already was told by SEELE that Lilith was there! Before he went in, he was told by them!) Why did Kaworu die for Shinji's sake? Shinji is no more valuable than Kaworu. Was he supposed to target Shinji the entire time? Was he in love or not with Shinji, and if so, Platonically or erotically? (See the point about drafts.) What does it mean that images of Kaworu show up later in EoE?

And so on. As Kaworu stands, he's this bishonen who flashes on screen for 10 minutes, has ambiguous social intercourse with Shinji, then wanders around NERV until he commits suicide-by-Eva after uttering confusing and flat-out contradictory vague statements. Nor do the ancillary materials help; things like the Addition audiodrama lampshade (see TvTropes) things like his yaoi-ness, and lampshading is just an embarrassed reaction to plot failure.

What's going on in his head? Nothing? He's a cipher.

> These terrible plot holes you mention are really just things left up to interpretation. Just because an idea isn't fully explained or fleshed out doesn't mean there can't be a successful progression from beginning to end. Besides, I don't worry too much about plausibility or consistency too much when kids are piloting giant walking humans by hacking their spinal column and brain.

There is a difference between progression from beginning to end caused by meaningful plot, cause-and-effect, and a progression caused by the brute succession of 25 frames per second.

    09:17AM [0mLoganPayne] Is it wrong to think I see a plot hole in ep10
    09:19AM [0mLoganPayne] Here's a question
    09:20AM [0mLoganPayne] Why did they have problems knowing wtf in ep10
    09:21AM [0mLoganPayne] Ok 10 was magma diver
    09:21AM [0mLoganPayne] and when misato suggested they capture the angel
    09:21AM [0mLoganPayne] Seele threw a hissy
    09:21AM [0mLoganPayne] but allowed it
    09:21AM [0mLoganPayne] They didn't even know if it would cause 3I
    09:22AM [0mLoganPayne] I thought Seele at that time knew what would cause 3I
    09:23AM [0mSachi_13] Maybe if they just had an Angel fetus, it would cause 3I
    09:23AM [0mSachi_13] wouldn't*
    09:25AM [0mRAyanami] how would capturing the angel with unit-2 result in 3i anyway?
    09:25AM [0mLoganPayne] I had a question from the Jet alone episode as well...what ever became of misato's discovery that the jet alone went FUBAR on purpose
    09:25AM [0mSachi_13] I was wondering the same thing
    09:25AM [0mRAyanami] there's no union of adam/lilith there to cause hassle
    09:25AM [0mLoganPayne] Ray: from what I understand they were capturing a live one
    09:25AM [0mLoganPayne] adam was live when he went boom
    09:26AM [0mLoganPayne] At that point in the show they acted like 2I was an accident
    09:26AM [0mSachi_13] Adam's didn't cause 2I though, it was Lilin
    09:27AM [0mSachi_13] What exactly are you saying would cause 3I in that ep?
    09:28AM [0mLoganPayne] They don't even know is the point
    09:28AM [0mLoganPayne] Seele is supposed to know
    09:28AM [0mLoganPayne] and yet they act like they don't
    09:28AM [0mSachi_13] Supposed to know what?
    09:29AM [0mLoganPayne] Seele is supposed to know what caused 2I and what will cause 3I correct?
    09:29AM [0mLoganPayne] Ok there's a scene in ep10 where gendo goes to seele asking for permission to capture sandalphon alive
    09:30AM [0mRAyanami] i think misato always had JA in mind, and it fueled he suspiscion of nerv
    09:30AM [0mLoganPayne] and in the meeting seele acts like they don't know what causes 2i or 3i
    09:31AM [0mLoganPayne] Ray: I think you're right but she kept it to herself rather than pointing out that observation to anyone
    09:31AM [0mLoganPayne] Misato seemed to know enough to at like she didn't notice it was all bullogna
    09:32AM [0mSachi_13] Logan: What exactly do you think shows that they don't know?
    09:37AM [0mSachi_13] Anyways, contact between Unit-02 and Sandy* wouldn't cause 3I
    09:37AM [0mLoganPayne] well yes
    09:37AM [0mLoganPayne] We know that
    09:37AM [0mLoganPayne] but the question is why didn't seele know that
    09:38AM [0mSachi_13] Seele knew that
    09:38AM [0mLoganPayne] continuity error
    09:38AM [0mLoganPayne] they didn't act it
    09:38AM [0mLoganPayne] and this was in a meeting when they should have no reason to lie
    09:38AM [0mLoganPayne] gendo, fuyu, and seele
    09:38AM [0mSachi_13] By "failure", I think they meant that if Nerv failed in capturing an Angel, it would destroy everything and cause 3I
    09:39AM [0mLoganPayne] they seemed to say "bring a big net or we'll all die somehow"
    09:40AM [0mLoganPayne] I wonder if sandy will be in 2.0
    09:40AM [0mSachi_13] No, they mean if you fail, the Angel will be free to cause 3I
    09:40AM [0mLoganPayne] oh
    09:40AM [0mLoganPayne] they acted differently in my interpretation of the lines
    09:40AM [0mLoganPayne] my bad
    09:40AM [0mLoganPayne] when you see it...
    09:41AM [0mRAyanami] they left Rei in the geofront in case anything dodgy went down at the volcano iirc
    09:41AM [0mLoganPayne] they said that was because the prototype didn't have the outfitting to go in magma
    09:41AM [0mSachi_13] Unit-00 was still being repaired at the time, wasn't it?
    09:41AM [0mLoganPayne] no
    09:41AM [0mLoganPayne] unit 00 was fixed after ramiel
    09:41AM [0mLoganPayne] i thought
    09:42AM [0mSachi_13] Didn't make an appearance until Matarael
    09:42AM [0mLoganPayne] not by the next episode

Not pacing reasons, or plot development - 'In ''Eva 1.0'', Misato tells Shinji that Third Impact would occur if an Angel came in contact with Lilith in Central Dogma.' eva 1.0 doesn't cover magma diver!

Peter Svensson (private email):

> There's quite a bit of this. "Adam and Lilith can never touch without making 3rd Impact!" But then... why is Unit-01 cloned of Lilith? Man, that is such an obvious after the fact addition that really doesn't make any sense.

> Heck, I'm reaching the conclusion that Anno hadn't yet figured out what Rei was. The impression that he was making it all up once he got past the halfway mark... I mean, Anno had the backstory. The big epic saga of the First Ancestral Race. But the little picture, the important details of the plot? That was all in flux.

# 1984

Yes, I'm familiar with Bochan's argument. But of course, he knows it's not a common view:

> This is a largely unpopular opinion of mine – so let me stress again this is in my view . However, I think the evidence is very much there to support the theory that there are two very different endings to the Evangelion story. But I do acknowledge that there is also persuasive evidence to the contrary. For the flip side of this theory, check out MDWig's very well-put counter argument.

MDWig's link is http://www.angelfire.com/anime4/mdwigs/endings.html

I find his analysis of the actual episode dialogues to be much more convincing than a vague link to _1984_. I certainly do agree that _Brazil_ has a _1984_-like ending, at least, the version that I saw.

(Anno references many many books in Eva, but usually SF classics like Heinlein's _Door into Summer_, “The Only Neat Thing To Do”, Ellison's “The Beast that shouted love at the heart of the world”, or Japanese works like _The Fascism of Love and Fantasy_ – and never Orwell.)

> Which is rather strange, despite Ep 25-26 making most viewers recall 1984 and Brazil.

Well, now you're making a strong statistical assertion – that a majority of viewers thought the ending was the same reversal as either 1984 or Brazil.

Leaving aside how few people have watched Brazil, 1984 is not cited nearly as often as one would expect given a majority. I mean, only 15 hits on the EFML: http://www.google.com/search?q=1984+OR+Brazil+site%3Aonegeek.org and most of those don't even have to do with the film/book but the founding of Gainax in the actual year! But that's better than the Eva wiki, with just 3 results none of which are relevant: http://wiki.evageeks.org/Special:Search?search=1984&fulltext=Search

# Lyrics by seiyuu

> and the lines they say in the song are far too perfectly picked for coincidence, With Asuka inexplicably getting the lines that seem to imply romantic interest (in my opinion at the least, coarse I could be wrong)^[<http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=258247#258247>]

It's an interesting question. The line selections are pretty ambiguous, but can we see patterns in it...?

I excerpted each character/seiyuu's lines from each of the [3 marked up sets of lyrics](http://forum.evageeks.org/viewtopic.php?p=256128#256128) by SSD. (In order, so it's "Cruel Angel's Thesis", episode 16 Interlude, "Fly Me To The Moon".)

1. Rei:

        A blue wind is now
        knocking at the door to your heart, and yet
        that you can't even see your fate yet,
        But someday I think you'll find out
        that what's on your back
        are wings that are for
        heading for the far-off future.
        Sleeping for a long time
        in the cradle of my love
        Stopping time all throughout the world
        You held tight to the form of life
        Do you love me?
        Who are you?
        Who are you?
        Who are you?
        Who are you?
        Do you love me?
        Fly me to the moon
        And let me play among the stars
        Fill my heart with song
        And let me sing forevermore
        In other words, I love you
2. Asuka:

        Something gently touching--
        you're so intent on seeking it out,
        Moonlight reflects off
        the nape of your slender neck.
        The sorrow then begins.
        People create history
        while weaving love.
        Even knowing I'll never be a goddess or anything like that,
        I live on.
        Why don't you become one with me?
        If you become one both in mind and body, it's a very, very comforting feeling.
        Do you love me?
        Let me see what spring is like
        On Jupiter and Mars
        darling kiss me
3. Misato:

        you are merely gazing at me
        and smiling.
        The morning is coming when you alone will be called
        by a messenger of dreams.
        So if two people being brought together by fate
        has any meaning,
        I think that it is a "bible"
        for learning freedom.
        You shine brighter than anyone else.
        Hey, you wanna kiss?
        Loneliness?
        Pleasure... Sky of reality... Cruel strangers
        Do you love me?
        You are all I long for
        All I worship and adore
        I love you

Asuka's set of lines are pretty straight forward, especially the last half. Could hardly ask for clearer expression of romance, I mean, come on - "Why don't you become one with me?" or "darling kiss me".

Interestingly, Misato's lines are also somewhat romantic with "Hey, you wanna kiss?" or "All I worship and adore / I love you".

This ties in well with the EoE kiss and with the commentary on Misato's little attempted-comforting scene in NGE TV, although I know I'm not in the majority when I see MisatoxShinji as a real possibility (as far as Misato is concerned).

One of the ways to guard against [hindsight bias](!Wikipedia) - 'oh yes, of course those Asuka lyrics look romantic, and Misato is just being affectionate' - is to not know in advance who said what, to blind yourself.

If one read the Rei lyrics without knowing whose they were, and said 'yes that's Yui alright' and Asuka's lyrics 'yes, that proud and loving, Asuka alright' and then Misato 'yes, that's protective and maternal', then one would have good reason to believe that that's how those lyrics were meant.

No, wait - I lied previously! I swapped Misato and Asuka! Did you think that these lyrics are a valid source for interpretation, and accepted the little commentary above about Asuka? Then you need to be seriously considering whether Misato's view of Shinji was purely platonic; not a popular position among Eva fans...

Now, tricks and reversal tests aside. As far as Rei goes, the selected lyrics make a great deal of sense if we think about Rei's connection with the Moon in the Proposal and with Yui's characteristics - Yui encouraging Shinji to live on, Yui singing, I mean, existing forevermore. And if we stretch a little, some of the lines even look like they apply to NGE events - 'Stopping time all throughout the world' wouldn't be a terrible description of Instrumentality.

As far as Asuka - the only lines which don't have any obvious meaning are 'The morning is coming when you alone will be called / by a messenger of dreams.' Everything else reads well as a description of her relationship with Shinji or her personal problems (eg. "Pleasure... Sky of reality... Cruel strangers").

So. My verdict? Either the selected lines do map well onto the characters and offer further insight, or they're so ambiguous that you can read any damn theory into them and I've done just that.

Obviously I prefer the former, but I'm interested in whether anyone can argue for the latter.

        - Interesting idea: for God to exist, it must necessarily be limited and vulnerable to change, or be limited an unchanging. Either is unacceptable. If God exists, that is a truly atheistic enterprise.

        > "What do I mean by this, Eva fans? Simply that while there may not be any indication that there is a God behind the world of Evangelion, such a lack is not supposed either. Alternately, it may mean that there is a God, but that such a God, by virtue of existence, is imperfect, and thus not the Absolute so many of us seem to take it to be. And consider Eva's addition of a first half of the underlying Final Lie of the 108. Perhaps the assignment of a concrete God would be the most atheistic project Eva could undertake."

        - Note especially the Confidential Information's lack of a god and materialist conception of the universe.
