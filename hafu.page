While watching _Honey and Clover_, it struck me that Hagu is clearly implied to be bi-racial (what with the blue eyes and blonde hair and thought bubbles of other characters putting her in idyllic European settings), and that her foreign parent is the *mother* since the father is specified to be head of police in some sense (and such a position would never be filled by a foreigner). And there are plenty of other examples where the mother is foreign.

In general, the father seems to be Japanese and the mother foreign. But isn't this kind of odd? If we could find statistics about this, one would expect the reality to be heavily slanted the other way - Japanese women marrying GIs, or marrying for passports, or just preferring the height and penis size of Caucasians[^penis]. Even in America, interracial dating is heavily in favor of Caucasian males and Asian females rather than the other way around[^sailer]. When fiction mirrors reality, that needs little explanation; but when fiction is exactly opposite reality, then one begins to wonder.

And the reality is extremely skewed. While most foreigner-Japanese marriages are marriages to a foreign woman, the picture changes when we break the figures out by nationality. The [2006 statistics](http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/database/db-hw/report/5.html) report that 1,474 American men married Japanese women, and 215 American women married Japanese men; similarly, 386 English grooms outweigh 79 English brides. Where do all the foreign women come from, then? China, Korea, and the Philippines - all countries somewhat or extremely poor per capita compared to Japan.

Sexual and familial metaphors are common in conceiving of nationalities & races ('the Rape of Nanking', Japan as the 'big brother' in the Asian Co-prosperity sphere), and it hardly needs pointing out that it is considered lower-status to be the woman in a relationship (the penetrated; consider the ancient Greeks' disdain of whichever male was being penetrated in a homosexual relationship, or the modern yaoi culture's general depiction of the '[bottom](!Wikipedia "Bottom (sex)")', the '[uke](!Wikipedia "Yaoi#Seme and uke"')). Fears of the foreigner stealing one's women is almost universal, from the most advanced industrial women to the Yanomano who go to war primarily to steal women from the others. (See how often this fear occurs in science fiction & fantasy. We see this xenophobia-as-fear-of-losing-competition-for-women everywhere; Asian-Americans males complain about white men stealing Asian-American females from them, and Southern men's fear of blacks touching their women is too well-known to need referencing.)

So, it seems pretty straightforward to suggest that a Japanese man marrying and impregnating a foreign woman would be seen as less status-lowering than a foreign man marrying and impregnating a Japanese woman. Westerners have, since Perry, been of high status in Japan for their technology & science & power. (Expats even today in Japan or Korea sometimes talk about 'playing the gaijin/waygook card' - breaking rules or shirking responsibilities through a combination of assumed ignorance on their part and their peculiar and higher status as a foreigner.) So, a Japanese woman marrying a Western man would lower her status (and by extension, that of Japan). Similarly we might expect that a Japanese man marrying an attractive Western woman (as the women universally seem to be in anime & manga) could actually gain status for himself - and by extension, Japan - from 'marrying above his position'. (At the very least, many men are attracted to the exotic other, and not so much the women.[^enokido]) This turns out to be an explanation offered by at least one Japanese writer for the previously cited international marriage statistics:

> "Men want "downward" partners while women want "upward" partners There are two prominent features about Japanese international marriages. One is that the majority of partners are from neighboring countries including Korea, China and Philippines. This is due to geographical and historical relations. The reason Brazil is outstanding in numbers is due to the fact that many Japanese-Brazilians are working in Japan. Another feature is that foreign wife and Japanese husband partnerships make up the majority of mixed marriages at 80 percent. In the case of foreign husbands, excluding neighboring countries, American husbands are most common. This may be due to the good Japan-US relations after the war and the fact that there are many American military bases in Japan. The tendency of international marriages is that, not only in Japan but also internationally, men want downward partners while women want upward partners. This means men want women whose educational background, income and height are less than theirs. Women are just the opposite. In Japan in the late 80's the jargon "San-ko" (three heights) became popular. This jargon refers to the educational background, income and height of men. It was a marriage condition for many Japanese women. Statistics prove that men with low incomes and women with high incomes are highly likely to be unmarried. However, Japanese me with low incomes are still rich for those who live in developing countries and the situation will meet their conditions. Among foreigners Japanese women generally want to marry Western men."^[["Now, One Out of 20 Marriages are Mixed!"](http://web.archive.org/web/20080602112650/http://www.hiraganatimes.com/hp/scenes/kiji/kiji222-2e.html), _[Hiragana Times](!Wikipedia)_]

[^penis]: Usually the controversy is over African or African-American penis sizes compared to Caucasian penis sizes; but even sources criticizing [Philippe Rushton](!Wikipedia)'s review ["Race Differences in Behaviour: A Review and Evolutionary Analysis"](http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/1988%20PAIDa%20(race%20review).pdf) citing many studies and reviews finding that black > white > east Asian admit that white penis sizes are larger than east Asian (eg. [Masters and Johnson](!Wikipedia) apparently measured a full inch average size difference in favor of whites). Well, it doesn't especially matter.
[^sailer]: Asian women tend to marry out much more than Asian men, according to US census records; [UPI](http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2003/03/14/Interracial-marriage-gender-gap-grows/UPI-86571047663924/): "Asian women had white husbands 3.08 times more often than Asian men had white wives. That means just over 75 percent of white-Asian couples featured a white husband and Asian wife. That 3.08 ratio is up from 2.54 times in 1990." See also Sailer's more in-depth article ["Is Love Colorblind?"](http://www.isteve.com/IsLoveColorblind.htm) and for the angry Asian-American perspective, Arthur Hu's _[AsianWeek](!Wikipedia)_ essay ["Part I: A Race of Rodney Dangerfields?"](http://www.arthurhu.com/97/06/aismen.txt) will serve nicely.
[^enokido]: In the _Complete Records Collection_ documenting _Evangelion 2.0_, [Yōji Enokido](!Wikipedia) discusses why the Asuka character (half-German, foreign mother) is so attractive and his difficulty integrating another hafu character (Mari Makinami, half-English, probable foreign mother):

    > "Concerning the matter of strengthening Mari's character, Anno-san had already been asking me if I had any ideas, so I started to investigate the problem. However, as I worked through it, the twosome "Rei and Asuka" was such a powerful combination that they seemed to stand in the way. When I tried to investigate what made this pair so strong, I realized that this combination followed the archetype of the so called "harem anime," and that all the desires, lusts, and dreams of young men were bound up in them.
    >
    > One "type" is the girl who was a childhood friend, who has always been with you since you were born, and with whom there are no new or strange feelings. Rei is established to resemble a "mother" in some respects, and so she produces in young men a feeling of distance [from things?] as though they were still half in the womb. Now, Asuka's particular type is that of the girl who comes from a foreign country. This also produces a very good feeling. Probably it is the male instinct to think, in some respects, that girls from another world are better than girls who are familiar and close to hand [laughs]."

From this status explanation, we could make a few predictions.

1. The Japanese man marrying out would be of a high SES, rather than low or average
2. the woman marrying out would be of a low SES

(If these 2 sound germane and obvious, that just shows how intuitive this sort of thinking is. There are actually 9 pairs of prediction the average status of M/F marrying out: low/low, low/middle, low/high; middle/low, middle/middle, middle/high; high/low, high/middle, high/high. This line of thinking singles out just high/low, although high/middle could also be justified.)

We might also expect some historical trend-lines in fictional pairings, with shifts in which as Japanese self-esteem increases, so do the number of Japanese males marrying out and a decrease in the number of women marrying out. From what I know of Japanese history,  Japanese self-esteem fell to a nadir post-Perry, with serious proposals to switch Japan to speaking English (!), then slowly recovering, soaring with the growth of the empire before crashing yet again in the wake of the ruinous WWII, and then slowly rising to a peak in the 1980s with the bubble and then collapsing a fair bit with the bubble's collapse. So if we charted the percentage of biracial characters with a Japanese male parent, we might expect to see a similar graph: low after WWII and increasing ever since, with possibly a fall post 1990 or so.

In advance, I suspect there may not be enough bi-racial characters to draw a neat graph, and selection bias & difficulty in finding such biracial characters with information in English would distort the true graph.

> Mr. Craig seems to be supporting the Korean people, and criticizing the arrogance of foreigners who would dare complain about people who call their female companions whores to their faces, but he chose a rather inapt analogy. It wasn't that "only prostitutes" were accustomed to walking alongside men - something that suggests that all women seen walking with men in Korea were assumed to be prostitutes. The point was that it was assumed that only prostitutes would be seen walking with *foreign* men.

> There are many movies and documentaries about female prostitutes. While some focus on women forced into prostitution against their will, most of the rest vaguely imply that the female prostitutes are exploited by their male customers. The message seems to be "They don't see that the money they gain is just not worth their loss of intimacy, self-respect, etc." http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/03/recipe-men-exploit-fems.html

> The film was originally suggested by a British government department to improve relations between the Americans in the UK and the British public [13] following Powell and Pressburger's contributions to this sphere in A Canterbury Tale two years earlier, though neither film received any government funding nor input on plot or production. There was a degree of hostility against the American servicemen stationed in the UK for the invasion of Europe. They were viewed in some quarters as latecomers to the war and as "overpaid, oversexed and over here" by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: The English pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War against the British. Raymond Massey, portraying an American, was a Canadian national at the time the film was made, but became a naturalized American citizen afterward

> You know, there sure are a lot of Japanese men with Filipina wives. But that makes sense.
>
> Millions of Filipinos currently work overseas, an enormous population of expat laborers. (In fact, I didn't know this initially, but overseas remittances account for billions– literally billions!– of dollars in the Philippine economy.) In Japan, especially, Filipinas find lots of work. The "Filipinas hostess club" is a notable feature of Japanese nightlife, frequented by many a salaryman looking to relax and have a drink with some island beauties. And logically, with time and proximity in that kind of job, why wouldn't some workers fall in love and settle down with the locals?
>
> That's what I figured, and to me there's nothing wrong with it… But from what I've gathered from some late-night bar conversations with Japanese men, marrying a Filipina hostess is the equivalent of a Russian mail-order bride: A sketchy, ethically suspect last resort for lonely oddballs. So the popular perception goes.

However, the two died in an accident when Thobari was still very young, and as his only living relative, his grandfather (his mother's father) came to his aid.

# TODO

- They aren't half Japanese but i think they earn a mention : Ken from Street Fighter is 3/4 Japanese and Sean from SF3 is 1/4 Japanese .

- Orihime Soletta (half-Italian, half-Japanese) from Sakura Taisen 2 and Yuki (half-Greek, half-Japanese) from the manga Love for Venus have black hair, not blond hair. But then again Italians and Greeks, being mediterranean, generally do not have blonde hair.
- Many of the most popular characters in the Sakura Taisen series are at least half-Japanese, although they're otherwise from all over the place. Hanabi is Japanese/French (though she looks more Japanese than at least half the full Japanese characters in the series; Hanabi Kitaoji's grandmother is a Frenchwoman.), Gemini is Japanese/American.
-   Sakura Wars: one Japanese guy, two Japanese girls, one French girl, one half-Russian/half-Japanese, one Chinese and one Okinawan
-   Sakura Wars 2: one Japanese guy, two Japanese girls, one French girl, one half-Russian/half-Japanese, one Chinese, one Okinawan, one German and one half-Italian/half-Japanese
-   Sakura Wars 3: one Japanese guy, three Frenchwomen, one Vietnamese and one Japanese girl

- Saint Seiya. Saori is Greek though she grew up thinking she was Japanese and Hyoga is a Japanese-Russian.
- The characters of Saint Seiya come all over the globe, but the Five Man Band of main characters are all Japanese... except for Hyouga, who is half-Russian. He's blonde and blue-eyed (like his Missing Mom), has cold-based attacks some of which have Russian names, and he gets most of the (W)angst.
    - Justified in the manga, though, where the man that put them through the Training From Hell, Mitsumasa Kido, was actually their absurdly promiscuous father, and since he was Japanese...

- One of the three titular characters in Adolf is half Japanese half German, another is the Japanese-born son of Jewish German parents who considers himself Japanese.
- All the Jojos introduced from Part 3 to 6 in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure are at least part-Japanese and part-British.
    - Jotaro (Part 3) is one quarter "American", one quarter British (from Joseph, the Jojo from part 2) and half-Japanese.
    - Josuke (Part 4) is half-British (from Joseph, not that it's impossible...) and half-Japanese
    - Giorno (Part 5) is half-British (From Jonathan's body with Dio's head on top), half-Japanese and culturally Italian.
    - Jolyne (Part 6) is Jotaro's and an Italian-American woman's daughter.

- L from Death Note is part-Japanese, although he grew up in Britain.
    - Word Of God states that L is a quarter Japanese, quarter English, quarter Russian, and a quarter of either French or Italian.
    - Raye Penber is also a case of this trope: mixed Japanese and American. Justified in that the CIA wanted to send someone to Japan who wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb. The artist admits to playing up the character's "foreignness" when drawing him.

- In each of the Digimon anime, there is a token case of But Not Too Foreign.
    - Yamato and Takeru (Matt and T.K. in the dub) from Adventure and 02 are at least quarter-French. This is known because one episode in the World Tour arc features their French grandfather. Since the Digimon movie shows Yamato and Takeru visiting their grandmother in Shimane, fans have 'decided' that it is their paternal grandmother who lives in Shimane, and their maternal grandfather in France. Only problem is that their father's last name is Ishida, and their mother, Natsuko, went back to using her maiden name after the divorce—Takaishi. Grandpa's name is Michel.
    - Tamers' Lee Jianliang and Xiaochang (Henry and Suzie Wong) and their two older siblings are half-Chinese. Jianliang's Digimon partner, Terriermon, even speaks Cantonese.
    - Orimoto Izumi (Zoe), The Chick, was born in Japan, but spent most of her formative years in Italy and often uses Italian expressions in her speech. This actually plays into her character development, however, as it has resulted in her being much more individualistic and independent than her peers.
    - Tohma (Thomas) H. Norstein from Savers/Data Squad is the son of a Japanese woman and an Austrian aristocrat. Implied to have been born out of wedlock, he was outright rejected by his paternal grandmother after his mother's death, and his father couldn't bring himself to oppose her. This lead to a serious rift between them. While never opposing one's mother is typically Japanese, it is not very Germanic.
    - Digimon 01/02. Matt and TK are at least 1/4 French though most of this series doesn't take place in Japan. In the 3rd season which mostly does take place in Japan, Henry Wong is from Hong Kong.

- In Cyborg 009, Joe Shimamura aka 009 is also half-Japanese (mother), half-American (father), and in the manga he was bullied because of that. So are three friends of his (Mary, Shinichi and Masaru) who are turned into killing machines against their wills by Black Ghost, so he has to fight them and KILL them.

- Gundam 00 has such characters. Sumeragi Li Noriega an American born Japanese-Spanish. And three Japanese-Americans; Saji Crossroad, his sister Kinue and Billy Katagiri.

- Syaoran Li, if that is his real name, from Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle has a Chinese dad and a Japanese mom.
    - Eriol Hiiragizawa is half British, half Japanese, and is the reincarnation of the aforementioned half Chinese, half British, Clow Reed.
    - Watanuki is probably also half Chinese, considering that he's kinda sorta bizarrely the twin brother/clone/son/something of Syaoran...look, it's complicated, okay?
