While watching _Honey and Clover_, it struck me that Hagu is clearly implied to be bi-racial (what with the blue eyes and blonde hair and thought bubbles of other characters putting her in idyllic European settings), and that her foreign parent is the *mother* since the father is specified to be head of police in some sense (and such a position would never be filled by a foreigner). And there are plenty of other examples where the mother is foreign.

In general, the father seems to be Japanese and the mother foreign. But isn't this kind of odd? If we could find statistics about this, one would expect the reality to be heavily slanted the other way - Japanese women marrying GIs, or marrying for passports, or just preferring the height and penis size of Caucasians TODO: link Sailor's essay/article on interracial marrying preferences, google for penis size studies. When fiction mirrors reality, that needs little explanation; but when fiction is exactly opposite reality, then one begins to wonder. Sexual and familial metaphors are common in conceiving of nationalities & races ('the Rape of Nanking', Japan as the 'big brother' in the Asian Co-prosperity sphere), and it hardly needs pointing out that it is considered lower-status to be the woman in a relationship (the penetrated; consider the ancient Greeks' disdain of whichever male was being penetrated in a homosexual relationship, or the modern yaoi culture's general depiction of the 'bottom', the 'uke' TODO check I didn't mix up seme and uke, as the weaker & more passive partner). Fears of the foreigner stealing one's women is almost universal, from the most advanced industrial women to the Yanomano who go to war primarily to steal women from the others. (See how often this fear occurs in science fiction & fantasy. We see this xenophobia-as-fear-of-losing-competition-for-women everywhere; Asian-Americans males complain about white men stealing Asian-American females from them TODO <http://blog.angryasianman.com/> 'angry Asian') So, it seems pretty straightforward to suggest that a Japanese man marrying and impregnating a foreign woman would be seen as less status-lowering than a foreign man marrying and impregnating a Japanese woman. Westerners have, since Perry, been of high status in Japan for their technology & science & power. (Expats even today in Japan or Korea sometimes talk about 'playing the gaijin/waygook card' - breaking rules or shirking responsibilities through a combination of assumed ignorance on their part and their peculiar and higher status as a foreigner.) So we might expect that a Japanese man marrying an attractive Western woman (as the women universally seem to be in anime & manga) could actually gain status for himself - and by extension, Japan - from 'marrying above his position'. Similarly, a Japanese woman marrying a Western man would lower her status (and by extension, that of Japan).
From this status explanation, we could make a few predictions.

1. The Japanese man marrying out would be of a high SES, rather than low or average
2. the woman marrying out would be of a low SES

(If these 2 sound germane and obvious, that just shows how intuitive this sort of thinking is. There are actually 9 pairs of prediction the average status of M/F marrying out: low/low, low/middle, low/high; middle/low, middle/middle, middle/high; high/low, high/middle, high/high. This line of thinking singles out just high/low, although high/middle could also be justified.)

We might also expect some historical trend-lines in fictional pairings, with shifts in which as Japanese self-esteem increases, so do the number of Japanese males marrying out and a decrease in the number of women marrying out. From what I know of Japanese history,  Japanese self-esteem fell to a nadir post-Perry, with serious proposals to switch Japan to speaking English (!), then slowly recovering, soaring with the growth of the empire before crashing yet again in the wake of the ruinous WWII, and then slowly rising to a peak in the 1980s with the bubble and then collapsing a fair bit with the bubble's collapse. So if we charted the percentage of biracial characters with a Japanese male parent, we might expect to see a similar graph: low after WWII and increasing ever since, with possibly a fall post 1990 or so.

In advance, I suspect there may not be enough bi-racial characters to draw a neat graph, and selection bias & difficulty in finding such biracial characters with information in English would distort the true graph.

> Mr. Craig seems to be supporting the Korean people, and criticizing the arrogance of foreigners who would dare complain about people who call their female companions whores to their faces, but he chose a rather inapt analogy. It wasn't that "only prostitutes" were accustomed to walking alongside men - something that suggests that all women seen walking with men in Korea were assumed to be prostitutes. The point was that it was assumed that only prostitutes would be seen walking with *foreign* men.
<http://populargusts.blogspot.com/2011/03/more-responses-to-koreas-ups-and-downs.html>

> There are many movies and documentaries about female prostitutes. While some focus on women forced into prostitution against their will, most of the rest vaguely imply that the female prostitutes are exploited by their male customers. The message seems to be “They don’t see that the money they gain is just not worth their loss of intimacy, self-respect, etc.” http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/03/recipe-men-exploit-fems.html

> The film was originally suggested by a British government department to improve relations between the Americans in the UK and the British public [13] following Powell and Pressburger's contributions to this sphere in A Canterbury Tale two years earlier, though neither film received any government funding nor input on plot or production. There was a degree of hostility against the American servicemen stationed in the UK for the invasion of Europe. They were viewed in some quarters as latecomers to the war and as "overpaid, oversexed and over here" by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: The English pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War against the British. Raymond Massey, portraying an American, was a Canadian national at the time the film was made, but became a naturalized American citizen afterward

> But when it was all over and I was waiting in Manila for my flight home, I looked around and noticed something:
>
> You know, there sure are a lot of Japanese men with Filipina wives. But that makes sense.
>
> Millions of Filipinos currently work overseas, an enormous population of expat laborers. (In fact, I didn’t know this initially, but overseas remittances account for billions– literally billions!– of dollars in the Philippine economy.) In Japan, especially, Filipinas find lots of work. The “Filipinas hostess club” is a notable feature of Japanese nightlife, frequented by many a salaryman looking to relax and have a drink with some island beauties. And logically, with time and proximity in that kind of job, why wouldn’t some workers fall in love and settle down with the locals?
>
> That’s what I figured, and to me there’s nothing wrong with it… But from what I’ve gathered from some late-night bar conversations with Japanese men, marrying a Filipina hostess is the equivalent of a Russian mail-order bride: A sketchy, ethically suspect last resort for lonely oddballs. So the popular perception goes.

List extracted from [TvTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign):

- Saint Seiya. Saori is Greek though she grew up thinking she was Japanese and Hyoga is a Japanese-Russian.
- Digimon 01/02. Matt and TK are at least 1/4 French though most of this series doesn't take place in Japan. In the 3rd season which mostly does take place in Japan, Henry Wong is from Hong Kong.
- Lelouch from Code Geass is Britannian
- Samurai Gun's main character is half-japanese... Dutch
- Tamaki from Ouran High School Host is Japanese/French.
- Eri from School Rumble is British/Japanese.
- One of the three titular characters in Adolf is half Japanese half German, another is the Japanese-born son of Jewish German parents who considers himself Japanese.
- All the Jojos introduced from Part 3 to 6 in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure are at least part-Japanese and part-British.
    - Jotaro (Part 3) is one quarter "American", one quarter British (from Joseph, the Jojo from part 2) and half-Japanese.
    - Josuke (Part 4) is half-British (from Joseph, not that it's impossible...) and half-Japanese
    - Giorno (Part 5) is half-British (From Jonathan's body with Dio's head on top), half-Japanese and culturally Italian.
    - Jolyne (Part 6) is Jotaro's and an Italian-American woman's daugther.
- Many of the most popular characters in the Sakura Taisen series are at least half-Japanese, although they're otherwise from all over the place. Maria is Japanese/Russian, Orihime is Japanese/Italian, Hanabi is Japanese/French (though she looks more Japanese than at least half the full Japanese characters in the series), Gemini is Japanese/American.
-   Sakura Wars: one Japanese guy, two Japanese girls, one French girl, one half-Russian/half-Japanese, one Chinese and one Okinawan
-   Sakura Wars 2: one Japanese guy, two Japanese girls, one French girl, one half-Russian/half-Japanese, one Chinese, one Okinawan, one German and one half-Italian/half-Japanese
-   Sakura Wars 3: one Japanese guy, three Frenchwomen, one Vietnamese and one Japanese girl
- In Sister Princess, Haruka is half German, Yotsuba is half British, and Aria probably is French.
- Freesia Yagyu from Jubei-chan 2 is half-Russian and fluent, though her voice actor does a passable job.
- Cyndi Manabe in Gokujou Seitokai is a redhead, glib Huge Schoolgirl who spoke mainly in fragmented English, when she spoke at all. She was apparently discouraged by her American mother who does speak Japanese but, to continue the gag, has extremely bizarre sentence construction.
- Ritsuko Kettenkrad (Student Council President) from Kujibiki Unbalance is half-German and wears a World War II German-style helmet wherever she goes, although originally this depicted as an heirloom amongst successive class presidents.
- Lieutenant Kanuka Clancy from Patlabor is a biracial Japanese American who, ironically, is drawn with a more traditionally "Asian" appearance than anyone else in the cast.
- Lupin III, in the series of the same name; his father, Arsene Lupin, Jr., was the son of the original Arsène Lupin, main character of a famous French pulp adventure series of the late 19th and early 20th century. He would encounter the grandchildren and great-greatchildren of other famous fictional (and in some cases historical) figures, and in most cases, they would have a Japanese mother or grandmother.
- Mamori from Eyeshield 21 is quarter-American (on her mother?s side). Although she is the quickest to pick up the rules and nuances of Football (faster than the rookie players), according to the manga writer, her ancestry wasn?t planned to explain this. Instead, he came up with it as way to explain why such an upright/uptight character (and member of the school?s disciplinary committee) had brown hair in the color art. (The blond and brown-haired boys in the cast are assumed to have dye-jobs.)
- L from Death Note is part-Japanese, although he grew up in Britain.
    - Word Of God states that L is a quarter Japanese, quarter English, quarter Russian, and a quarter of either French or Italian.
    - Raye Penber is also a case of this trope: mixed Japanese and American. Justified in that the CIA wanted to send someone to Japan who wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb. The artist admits to playing up the character's "foreignness" when drawing him.
- In each of the Digimon anime, there is a token case of But Not Too Foreign.
    - Yamato and Takeru (Matt and T.K. in the dub) from Adventure and 02 are at least quarter-French. This is known because one episode in the World Tour arc features their French grandfather. Since the Digimon movie shows Yamato and Takeru visiting their grandmother in Shimane, fans have 'decided' that it is their paternal grandmother who lives in Shimane, and their maternal grandfather in France. Only problem is that their father's last name is Ishida, and their mother, Natsuko, went back to using her maiden name after the divorce—Takaishi. Grandpa's name is Michel.
    - Tamers' Lee Jianliang and Xiaochang (Henry and Suzie Wong) and their two older siblings are half-Chinese. Jianliang's Digimon partner, Terriermon, even speaks Cantonese.
    - Orimoto Izumi (Zoe), The Chick, was born in Japan, but spent most of her formative years in Italy and often uses Italian expressions in her speech. This actually plays into her character development, however, as it has resulted in her being much more individualistic and independent than her peers.
    - Tohma (Thomas) H. Norstein from Savers/Data Squad is the son of a Japanese woman and an Austrian aristocrat. Implied to have been born out of wedlock, he was outright rejected by his paternal grandmother after his mother's death, and his father couldn't bring himself to oppose her. This lead to a serious rift between them. While never opposing one's mother is typically Japanese, it is not very Germanic.
- Yomiko Readman of Read Or Die is half-British, half-Japanese.
- In Get Backers, Midou Ban is one-quarter German; of course the German grandparent is the only one we ever meet.
- The characters of Saint Seiya come all over the globe, but the Five Man Band of main characters are all Japanese... except for Hyouga, who is half-Russian. He's blonde and blue-eyed (like his Missing Mom), has cold-based attacks some of which have Russian names, and he gets most of the (W)angst.
    - Justified in the manga, though, where the man that put them through the Training From Hell, Mitsumasa Kido, was actually their absurdly promiscuous father, and since he was Japanese...
- Nishikiori Michiru from Kamichama Karin is half-English, half-Japanese.
- Michael Okita from Slam Dunk is mentioned to be half-Japanese (per father's side) and half-American. He also has blue eyes and blond hair, is bilingual and was supposed to be under the watch of the NBA. Not to mention he's quite the Genki Guy when off-duty.
- In Cyborg 009, Joe Shimamura aka 009 is also half-Japanese (mother), half-American (father), and in the manga he was bullied because of that. So are three friends of his (Mary, Shinichi and Masaru) who are turned into killing machines against their wills by Black Ghost, so he has to fight them and KILL them.).
- Kaede Kimura, from Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, is half-Japanese half-something-or-other (her absurd descriptions of her home country's customs make it impossible to tell where she's actually from or if she even has mixed heritage), and has developed a split personality based on her two home nations' stereotypes: Her Japanese half is extremely polite and gentle (and in love with Itoshiki-sensei), while her foreign half is loud, obnoxious and eager to sue her classmates at the slightest provocation.
    - Gosh, what lawsuit-happy foreign country could her other half hail from?
    - Actually, she's an example of the Fauxreigner trope. It's stated in her first appearance that she's returning from overseas classes, so she's a Japanese native. Majiru Itoshiki actually comments on her, a Japanese, pretending to be "white."
- In Bleach, Yasutora Sado or 'Chad' is half-Mexican half-Japanese and spent most of his childhood in Mexico. This is reflected in that he is drawn rather differently from the other characters, has darker skin and is much, much taller (being large even by non-Japanese standards).
    - He is actually from Okinawa, making him half-Mexican half-Ryukyuan, which means he has no part that is ethnically Japanese.
- In Mahou Sensei Negima!, Mana is half Puerto Rican. But the other half is demon.
    - Rich, Caucasian looking, girl Ayaka Yukihiro is also said by Fuuka Narutaki to be 'half breed', although Ayaka herself protested at being called that.
    - Negi himself is half-British/half-Ostian.
- Amuro Rei from Mobile Suit Gundam is arguably one of the most famous examples of this trope in all of anime, although his background rarely comes up in conversation. In most versions his mother Kamaria is Canadian, although in the recent Gundam: The Origin manga she was changed to Mexican due to the action in the North America arc being shifted a few thousand kilometers south, as world events have made the image of a bombed-out, foreign occupied NYC less than conducive to a US release.
- Gundam 00 has such characters. There's H/Allelujah Haptism, a Russian-Chinese. Sumeragi Li Noriega an American born Japanese-Spanish. And three Japanese-Americans; Saji Crossroad, his sister Kinue and Billy Katagiri.
- Lemmy from To Heart is another prime example. She's half Japanese and half American. this is expressed by her having blond hair, blue eyes, being a Huge Schoolgirl, having a fairly good sized bust, her use of English
- Ai Haibara a.k.a. Sherry of Detective Conan is half English.
    - However, she was visibly Caucasian, and did mentioned that people with visual foreign traits like her are subjected with prejudice.
- Jun Honoo in Great Mazinger is one of the first examples (half-black, but the exact nationality of her father is not given), and also notable in being the hero's love interest in the series, something very unusual for these years.
- Karen Kouzuki/Kallen Stadtfeld from Code Geass is half Japanese (mother), half Britannian (father, stepfamily). So is Rai, the main character from Lost Colors: his father was a Britannian noble and his mother was from the Sumeragi clan.
- Urd from Ah My Goddess has no Japanese blood, but shares the insecurities/issues of many other cases of this trope because of her own mixed heritage... her mother is a demon ( the Queen of Hell to be exact).
- The rival band from NANA, TRAPNEST, often features fluently English lyrics; likely a product of half-American vocalist Layla 'Reira' Serizawa. In being signed to a label, their record company ultimately decides to hide her heritage by making her image and name more ambiguously Asian— reason being that the Japanese (and implied xenophobic) public would be more impressed with her English if she were a native.
- Syaoran Li, if that is his real name, from Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle has a Chinese dad and a Japanese mom.
    - Don't forget Clow Reed himself, who had a Chinese mother and a British father.
    - Eriol Hiiragizawa is half British, half Japanese, and is the reincarnation of the aforementioned half Chinese, half British, Clow Reed.
    - Watanuki is probably also half Chinese, considering that he's kinda sorta bizarrely the twin brother/clone/son/something of Syaoran...look, it's complicated, okay?
- Sakura Yamazaki from Blue Seed may be a full-blooded Japanese miko but she was raised in America (by the CIA no less) so she's stereotypically brash and prone to spouting off exclamations in Gratuitous English.
- Urara Kasugano of Yes! Pretty Cure 5 is half French, half Japanese. This would appear to be a Hand Wave to explain her blond hair, except that You Gotta Have Blue Hair is in effect. Amusingly, this makes her the character who matches the setting the best.
- In the manga FAKE (set in NYC), we have Randy Ryo McLean. Despite initially going by "Randy", both partner Dee and future-foster-kid Bikky both correctly identify him as part-Japanese based off of his eyes alone when they first meet him and insist on calling him by his middle name. Soon they have practically everyone else calling him that too. While Dee's ethnicity is unknown (abandoned as a baby), Bikky himself is half-black, half-white.
- Firo Prochainezo from Baccano!! (set in early 20th century America) is half-Italian (the other half being British-descended American), and identifies himself as a second-generation Italian immigrant. With the exception of Japanese-American Yalgumo, most other characters don't have their ethnicity particularly focused upon — although many of the supporting characters are decidedly not American-born simply on the basis that they're a good sixty years older than the country itself.
- Tina Foster from Ai Yori Aoshi is an excellent example. She's an American raised in Hakata until middle school. She was unable to make friends in elementary and middle school in Japan due to her being "too American" and also in high school in America due to being "too Japanese." She covers up her feelings of being culturally lost by constantly trying to show how "Japanese" she is at heart (one of the other characters comments "You're almost more Japanese than we are!"). She desperately wants to be Japanese (and probably practically is after being raised in Japan during her formative years) and is a very tragic and lonely figure despite being a Bottle Fairy (to the point of overt alcoholism) and overall Genki Girl and semi-lunatic. One of the most sympathetically played "Not Too Foreign" characters in anime and manga.
- Jun, from Science Ninja Team Gatchaman is half American, half Japanese.
- Unbalance X Unbalance, a manhwa features a British-Korean character who is a younger half sister to one of the main characters.
- Fumio Kirisaki of the Saitama Chainsaw Shoujo is three-quarters Japanese, since her grandfather immigrated from the US. She laments the fact that she didn't seem to pick up the standard physical traits from her western heritage.
- Gokudera Hayato from Katekyo Hitman Reborn! has a Japanese mother and an Italian father.
- Thobari Kumohira Durandal of Nabari No Ou is, apparently, partially of Japanese heritage, but was born and raised in Ireland.
- Remy Shimada from Go Shogun is part-French, part-Japanese.
- (Meister) Sylvan Kirisaki and his sister Sophie from Yakitate!! Japan are half-French. While Meister is now the manager of the Pantasia Main Branch and a bread judge in Japan, Sophie remained in France as a baker.
- Spencer Henry Hokou aka "Sachihoko" is an odd case. He is 100% Italian-American, but has a mentality of a dude from Nagoya. He starts to lose his Nagoya-ness once he returned to America though.
- Suoh and Shion of Darker Than Black 2 are half-Japanese half-Russian.
- In Soul Eater, Black Star mentions that Maka, like him, is Japanese. This would be half-Japanese in her case, as her father is Spirit Albarn. There are other Japanese characters - Tsubaki and Yumi for e.g - but much of the cast are at least suggested (mostly through names, or area they work in) to be from all over the place.
- Momoko Asuka from Ojamajo Doremi was born in Japan, but grew up in America, causing her to speak (perfect) English when she's nervous, which renders her unintelligible to the other girls. It's also reflected in her character design, which makes her look somewhat more edgy than the other girls and her Leitmotif sounding completly different from every other song used in the series.
- Ai Kora: Sakurako's mother is English in order to justify her having the blue eyes which Maeda so covets.
- Though never brought up in the Durarara!! anime, Walker Yumasaki is regularly noted in the Light Novels to be biracial (half-what has yet to be elaborated upon, but it's implied to be white)
- Sei from Maria-sama Ga Miteru apparently has some non-Japanese ancestry, but we're informed she still has "attractive Japanese features" regardless.
- Reiko Kathrine Akimoto, _Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo_
- Ana Coppola, Strawberry Marshmallow
- Isn't that Gogol 17 [sp?] character, you know, the dude with the extendable cock, a halvsie?
- Hitomi from the Dead or Alive video game series is half-Japanese...
- Heindrick and Elizabeth K. Strawberryfield (half-English, half-Japanese) from Kamen no Maid Guy
- Niina Isokawa (half-American, half-Japanese) from Tona-gura
- Sophie Balzac Kirisaki (half-French, half-Japanese) from Yakitate Japan
- Meister Silvan Kirisaki (half-French, half-Japanese) from Yakitate Japan
- Kouji Jefferson Sakai (half-Swedish, half-Japanese) from Hungry Heart~ Wild Striker has silvery-blonde hair.
- Orihime Soletta (half-Italian, half-Japanese) from Sakura Taisen 2 and Yuki (half-Greek, half-Japanese) from the manga Love for Venus have black hair, not blond hair. But then again Italians and Greeks, being mediterranean, generally do not have blonde hair.
- What's more interesting is that all half-Japanese, half-French children such as Suou Tamaki, Sophie Balzac Kirisaki, Meister Silvan Kirisaki, Elise Housen, Christine Hanakomachi have French mothers and Japanese fathers. Hanabi Kitaoji's grandmother is a Frenchwoman.
- SOLID SNAKE FROM METAL GEAR SOLID—HIS REAL MOM IS JAPANESE, BUT HE WAS BORN FROM A WHITE WOMAN WHO WAS A SURROGATE BUT CARRIED THE EGG OF A JAPANESE WOMAN, MAKING SNAKE HALF JAPANESE. THE WHOLE SITUATION IS CONFUSING AND COMPLEX BUT YOU GET THE BASIC IDEA
- They aren't half japanese but i think they earn a mention : ken from street fighter is 3/4 japanese and sean from sf3 is 1/4 japanese .
- And in Onimusha4, there's a playable character named Roberto whose father is Spanish and mother is Japanese.
- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckaroo_Banzai_%28character%29>
- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tate>
- in Yoko Kamio's portrayal of the half-German, half-Japanese blond Thomas in Hana Yori Dango/Boys Over Flowers (Viz), the highlight lines occur only in more distinct, isolated clumps scattered unobtrusively throughout the character's hair.
- In the manga, it is stated by Sakamoto that Akesato is mixed blood (half-Japanese and half-Caucasian); she has blonde hair (which she hides under a wig) and blue eyes. _Peacemaker Kurogane_
- _Kimi to Boku_, "a half-Japanese transfer student Chizuru, who has started to liven up the group"
