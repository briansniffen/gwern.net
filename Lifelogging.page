The fundamental idea of lifelogging is that computing resources are pervasive and cheap: Having not just a computer, but I/O peripherals and indefinite storage space. We may spend 50% of our waking time with access to a computer (if not actually using it), but there is a profound difference between 50% and 100%, a difference much greater than what the mere numerical fact of doubling would suggest.
Instead, we ought to expect order of magnitude changes. Cell phones may boost the access to 99%, but they miss the crucial 1%. Even still, cell phones have woven their way into the lives of Generation Y and Zers: they aren't just communication tools used occasionally, they have ascended almost to a new sense or a new mental world.

Random thoughts: telecoms know this, and seek to sell our cellphones to us piecemeal; a world parceled up and rented out will bring quite a bit.

Will cheap social contact mean that ever more time has to be spent on social grooming? If it takes an hour to walk to a friend's house, they will forgive you for only hanging out once a week. But if it takes 2 seconds to ring them up or text message them...

When we go from 99% to 100%, cell phones can become _part of our minds_. Consider: it takes less than a second to move your dominant hand from anywhere to anywhere. (Try it out.) Imagine wearing a [heads up display](!Wikipedia) with perhaps a keyboard on your forearm. Any message from the computer to you will reach your brain in something under a tenth of a second, and you can being responding in less than a second. This may seem cumbersome, but our very thoughts and memories aren't much faster! We've all experienced moments where it was faster to go to a browser and look up a factoid than to struggle with our memory and work with associations and hope the factoid will suddenly pop into mind; fact is, even our short-term or working memory operator on the time scale of fractions of seconds and seconds.

Isn't that amazing? Our programs are as 'far away' as our memories! With the right interface, a computer is competitive with our very mind. We're not even postulating way-out-there Sci-Fi technology like brain-computer interfaces, just normal technology produced commercially right now, which you could go out and buy or assemble yourself.

Hitherto, computers have been best known for replacing _work_. Number crunching, manufacturing, etc. But as overhead & 'friction' shrink, computers can increasingly replace **mental processes**.

Consider [Mnemosyne]() & SRS in general. We could view this as a crude, high-overhead replacement for an eidetic memory; or we could view as the computerization of a mental process - imagine one kept the flashcards in a [memory palace](!Wikipedia) and every day 'walked' through it. Here we have a very simple^[run the program and do whatever it tells you] *computerized* habit replacing a very complex^[the advanced mnemonic techniques have always been used by very few; even [Giordano Bruno](!Wikipedia) may not have used all the techniques he taught.] *mental* habit.

Consider this [XKCD](!Wikipedia) comic, ["I know you're listening"](http://xkcd.com/525/); it's funny as a parody of [Pascal's Wager](!Wikipedia), but it's also funny because we know we could never really do that (the novelty would wear off too quickly), and the fact that we could never really do it means it'd be all the funnier if someone did that and someone *was* listening. Or consider the standard advice for people attempting to induce [lucid dream](!Wikipedia)s: to periodically check for dream-like events & situations, in the hope that this habit will carry over to when actually in a dream. But who can randomly stop and deliberately ask whether they're in a dream? When I know I'm awake, I won't ask; and when I don't know I'm awake, I won't think about it...

But a computer can do this! Waking up at random times is trivial for a computer; utilities like [cron] have been around for half a century now. We could program all sorts of habits into it: check your shoelaces, see whether you can fly, say aloud one of its canned scripts (like the XKCD one), review a flashcard scheduled for that minute^[We can see early versions of this. Anki can schedule cards down to the minute, and there is already a website/application called [Popling](http://popling.net/) which will pop up a scheduled card every few minutes. It's advertised for those who 'lack motivation'; there is probably also a connection to [intermittent reinforcement](!Wikipedia)/game mechanics.], get a reminder of upcoming deadlines, etc. We can imagine even more sophisticated ones: the computer could say 'did you remember to drop your daughter off at the daycare? I noticed my camera picked up an image of her getting into the car but none of her getting out'^[A functionality that would be appreciated by any parent who has absent-mindedly left their child in the car to bake to death.]. Classic issues like babies sleeping or not sleeping are easier with more data.^[Before you dismiss this as contrived, consider that the cellphone application [Trixie Tracker](http://www.trixietracker.com/) charges [$50 annually](http://www.trixietracker.com/pricing/) to track babies' sleep and feeding data. It is not a mini-EEG like the [Zeo](), nor is it a motion-based sleep tracker. If you read the [press coverage](http://www.trixietracker.com/press#presssection), all the data is entered manually by the parents. In other words, it is a spreadsheet with a nice UI.] And there are more novel uses like recording everything a child utters to see whether its language skills are above-average for its age or not.^[[LENA](http://www.lenababy.com/LenaHome/why-use-lena-home.aspx) is what looks like an ordinary USB audio recorder (~$50) combined with a voice-recognition/transcription program (likely akin to [Dragon NaturallySpeaking](!Wikipedia); ~$90 retail) and some statistics code. It costs $700.]

And this is to say nothing about the possibilities enabled by retrospective review:

> "In 2004, Marian Bakermans-Kranenburg, a professor of child and family studies at Leiden University, started carrying a video camera into homes of families whose 1-to-3-year-olds indulged heavily in the oppositional, aggressive, uncooperative, and aggravating behavior that psychologists call “externalizing”: whining, screaming, whacking, throwing tantrums and objects, and willfully refusing reasonable requests...\
> In an intervention her lab had developed, she or another researcher visited each of 120 families 6 times over 8 months; filmed the mother and child in everyday activities, including some requiring obedience or cooperation; and then edited the film into teachable moments to show to the mothers...\
> The moms, watching the videos, learned to spot cues they’d missed before, or to respond differently to cues they’d seen but had reacted to poorly. Quite a few mothers, for instance, had agreed only reluctantly to read picture books to their fidgety, difficult kids, saying they wouldn’t sit still for it...when these mothers viewed the playback they were “surprised to see how much pleasure it was for the child—and for them.” Most mothers began reading to their children regularly, producing what Bakermans-Kranenburg describes as “a peaceful time that they had dismissed as impossible.”\
> ...A year after the intervention ended, the toddlers who’d received it had reduced their externalizing scores by more than 16%, while a nonintervention control group improved only about 10%...And the mothers’ responses to their children became more positive and constructive.\
> Few programs change parent-child dynamics so successfully."^[["The Science of Success"](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200912/dobbs-orchid-gene), David Dobbs, December 2009, _[The Atlantic](!Wikipedia)_]

Unconvinced? Then read the _New York Times Magazine_, ["The Data-Driven Life"](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02self-measurement-t.html?hp=&pagewanted=all) and see the scores of uses people have come up with for even partial scanty data gathering/life logging.


The problem with a mental habit is that it either needs to be constantly in mind - and taking up precious mental space - or it is 'out of sigh, out of mind'. Computers could not care less about this.

So we might divide portable computers' functionality into 2 major category:

- memory; taken to its extreme, it becomes lifelogging
- supervision

What 'memory' means is not always apparent.

A calendar is pretty obviously 'memory', but a calendar is relatively simple. But there's lot of temporal data one might want; TO-DO lists, augmented with dates and reminders. A passive calendar can't do that.

But the reminders can be much more complex than 'send an email on March 26'. Arbitrarily complex reminders are useful. Consider the [phenomenon](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/21/AR2010042104578.html) of [iPhone applications](!Wikipedia) aimed at men, which track a woman's menstrual cycle and predict when they are [PMSing](!Wikipedia); this can be very useful for men as they know when to be extra-thoughtful and forgiving.

Now, what does the iPhone add? Nothing stops men from [using spreadsheets](http://www.slate.com/id/2248580/pagenum/all/) to track menstrual cycles, but few did before. Spreadsheets even take most of the work out of it. So why do the men using iPhone applications seem somehow less creepy and more understandable than the men using spreadsheets on their desktops? Because the effort involved is lower, and it is more useful. (One can believe that a low-effort-high-payoff program like an iPhone application is genuine; but a high-effort-low-payoff desktop spreadsheet makes one wonder what else the man is getting out of it, and thoughts turn to undefined sexual perversions.)

TODO

Wearable computers have many possibilities:

- 10 second audio loop for when you miss something
- directional/boom mikes
- voice-to-text dictation of conversations (even high error rate would be useful for search)
- random Mnemosyne quizzes

Lifelogging increases liberty & freedom:

- _[The Transparent Society](!Wikipedia)_
- Bruce Schneier on recording the police: <http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/recording_the_p.html>

Lifelogging runs afoul of old wiretapping and privacy laws:

- <http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/-modern-divorce-wiretapped-teddy-bears-120000-in-fines.ars>

    > "Digital recording tools are so cheap and simple to use that it's easy to deploy them without thinking through the consequences. A Nebraska mother and grandfather found this out the hard way last month when they were hit with a combined $120,000 penalty for wiretapping after sticking an audio recorder inside a young girl's favorite teddy bear.
    >
    > Though the mother claimed only to be concerned with her child's welfare, the judge found that the indiscriminate use of the recording device had violated the privacy of numerous people, each of whom were entitled to $10,000."

> A combination of new software and human transcription called [Blitzscribe](http://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/cognitive-machines) allowed them to parse 200 terabytes of data to capture the emergence and refinement of specific words in Roy’s son’s vocabulary. (Luckily, the boy was an early talker.) In one 40-second clip, you can hear how “gaga” turned into “water” over the course of six months. In a video clip, below, you can hear and watch the evolution of "ball." 
>
> ...Most moving of all was the precise mapping of tight feedback loops between the child and his caregivers—father, mother, nanny. For example, Roy was able to track the length of every sentence spoken to the child in which a particular word--like “water”--was included. Right around the time the child started to say the word, what Roy calls the “word birth,” something remarkable happened.
>
> “Caregiver speech dipped to a minimum and slowly ascended back out in complexity.” In other words, when mom and dad and nanny first hear a child speaking a word, they unconsciously stress it by repeating it back to him all by itself or in very short sentences. Then as he gets the word, the sentences lengthen again. The infant shapes the caregivers’ behavior, the better to learn. [Note the connection with [spaced repetition](Mnemosyne). Start simple, and repeat.]

["Big brother untangles baby babble"](http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8127804.stm):

> "Current samples that the field works with - typically an hour of recorded speech a week - are one to two orders of magnitude too small for our scientific purposes," Professor Steven Pinker of Harvard University told BBC News.
> 
> So, Professor Roy, who by then had a child on the way, set about solving the conundrum. His solution: wire up his house with 11 cameras, 14 microphones and terabytes of storage and record every waking moment of his soon-to-arrive son. 
> 
> ...Now, a quarter of million hours of recordings later, Professor Roy is beginning to tease apart the masses of data and look for answers.
> 
> To extract meaningful patterns from the 200GB (gigabytes) of data that flowed daily onto the racks of hard drives in the basement, the team created a series of software tools. 
> 
> ...Automatic systems could have error rates of up to 90%, he said.
> 
> At the other extreme, Professor Roy also experimented with human transcribers, but that also came with its own problems.
> 
> "It would take an average of 10 hours to find and transcribe one hour of speech," he told the BBC. 
> 
> ...Instead, the researchers created a piece of software called Blitzscribe, which finds speech in the recordings and breaks it down into easily transcribed sound bites.
> 
> "We have automated components assisting human annotators," he said.
> 
> The net result is that we have reduced 10 hours down to two hours."
> 
> The analysis also takes into account how a word was said - called prosody - and who said it.
> 
> To date, the team have already transcribed more than four million words.
> 
> "It's already the most complete transcript of everyday life at home than any recording ever made."
> 
> A similar human-computer system, called TrackMarks, has also been developed to analyse the video and gives information such as where people are in relation to one another and the orientation of their heads. 
> 
> ...In part to address this criticism, he has developed a stand-alone device - called the Speechome recorder - that can be easily put into homes with out 1000m (3000ft) of wiring in the walls and converting the basement into a data centre.
> 
> The devices look like floor lamps and contain an overhead microphone and camera, with another lens at eye level for children.
> 
> The base of the device holds a touch-screen display and enough storage to hold several months of recordings.
> 
> Their first deployment will be in six pilot studies of children with autism where they will be used to monitor and quantify the children's response to treatment.
