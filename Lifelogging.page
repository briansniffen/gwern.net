The fundamental idea of lifelogging is that computing resources are pervasive and cheap: Having not just a computer, but I/O peripherals and indefinite storage space. We may spend 50% of our waking time with access to a computer (if not actually using it), but there is a profound difference between 50% and 100%, a difference much greater than what the mere numerical fact of doubling would suggest.
Instead, we ought to expect order of magnitude changes. Cell phones may boost the access to 99%, but they miss the crucial 1%. Even still, cell phones have woven their way into the lies of Generation Y and Zers: they aren't just communication tools used occasionally, they have ascended almost to a new sense or a new mental world.

Random thoughts: telecoms know this, and seek to sell our cellphones to us piecemeal; a world parceled up and rented out will bring quite a bit.

Will cheap social contact mean that ever more time has to be spent on social grooming? If it takes an hour to walk to a friend's house, they will forgive you for only hanging out once a week. But if it takes 2 seconds to ring them up or text message them...

When we go from 99% to 100%, cell phones can become _part of our minds_. Consider: it takes less than a second to move your dominant hand from anywhere to anywhere. (Try it out.) Imagine wearing a [heads up display](!Wikipedia) with perhaps a keyboard on your forearm. Any message from the computer to you will reach your brain in something under a tenth of a second, and you can being responding in less than a second. This may seem cumbersome, but our very thoughts and memories aren't much faster! We've all experienced moments where it was faster to go to a browser and look up a factoid than to struggle with our memory and work with associations and hope the factoid will suddenly pop into mind; fact is, even our short-term or working memory operator on the time scale of fractions of seconds and seconds.

Isn't that amazing? Our programs are as 'far away' as our memories! With the right interface, a computer is competitive with our very mind. We're not even postulating way-out-there Sci-Fi technology like brain-computer interfaces, just normal technology produced commercially right now, which you could go out and buy or assemble yourself.

Hitherto, computers have been best known for replacing _work_. Number crunching, manufacturing, etc. But as overhead & 'friction' shrink, computers can increasingly replace **mental processes**.

Consider [Mnemosyne]() & SRS in general. We could view this as a crude, high-overhead replacement for an eidetic memory; or we could view as the computerization of a mental process - imagine one kept the flashcards in a [memory palace](!Wikipedia) and every day 'walked' through it. Here we have a very simple^[run the program and do whatever it tells you] *computerized* habit replacing a very complex^[the advanced mnemonic techniques have always been used by very few; even [Giordano Bruno](!Wikipedia) may've not used all the techniques he covers] *mental* habit.

Consider this [XKCD](!Wikipedia) comic, ["I know you're listening"](http://xkcd.com/525/); it's funny as a parody of [Pascal's Wager](), but it's also funny because we know we could never really do that (the novelty would wear off too quickly), and the fact that we could never really do it means it'd be all the funnier if someone did that and someone *was* listening. Or consider the standard advice for people attempting to induce [lucid dream](!Wikipedia)s: to periodically check for dream-like events & situations, in the hope that this habit will carry over to when actually in a dream. But who can randomly stop and deliberately ask whether they're in a dream? When I know I'm awake, I won't ask; and when I don't know I'm awake, I won't think about it...

But a computer can do this! Waking up at random times is trivial for a computer; utilities like [cron] have been around for half a century now. We could program all sorts of habits into it: check your shoelaces, see whether you can fly, say aloud one of its canned scripts (like the XKCD one), review a flashcard scheduled for that minute, get a reminder of upcoming deadlines, etc. We can imagine even more sophisticated ones: the computer could say 'did you remember to drop your daughter off at the daycare? I noticed my camera picked up an image of her getting into the car but none of her getting out'^[A functionality that would be appreciated by any parent who has absent-mindedly left their child in the car to bake to death.].

And this is to say nothing about the possibilities enabled by retrospective review:

> "In 2004, Marian Bakermans-Kranenburg, a professor of child and family studies at Leiden University, started carrying a video camera into homes of families whose 1-to-3-year-olds indulged heavily in the oppositional, aggressive, uncooperative, and aggravating behavior that psychologists call “externalizing”: whining, screaming, whacking, throwing tantrums and objects, and willfully refusing reasonable requests...\
> In an intervention her lab had developed, she or another researcher visited each of 120 families 6 times over 8 months; filmed the mother and child in everyday activities, including some requiring obedience or cooperation; and then edited the film into teachable moments to show to the mothers...\
> The moms, watching the videos, learned to spot cues they’d missed before, or to respond differently to cues they’d seen but had reacted to poorly. Quite a few mothers, for instance, had agreed only reluctantly to read picture books to their fidgety, difficult kids, saying they wouldn’t sit still for it...when these mothers viewed the playback they were “surprised to see how much pleasure it was for the child—and for them.” Most mothers began reading to their children regularly, producing what Bakermans-Kranenburg describes as “a peaceful time that they had dismissed as impossible.”\
> ...A year after the intervention ended, the toddlers who’d received it had reduced their externalizing scores by more than 16%, while a nonintervention control group improved only about 10%...And the mothers’ responses to their children became more positive and constructive.\
> Few programs change parent-child dynamics so successfully."^[["The Science of Success"](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200912/dobbs-orchid-gene), David Dobbs, December 2009, _[The Atlantic](!Wikipedia)_]

The problem with a mental habit is that it either needs to be constantly in mind - and taking up precious mental space - or it is 'out of sigh, out of mind'. Computers could not care less about this.

So we might divide portable computers' functionality into 2 major category:

- memory; taken to its extreme, it becomes lifelogging
- supervision

What 'memory' means is not always apparent.

A calendar is pretty obviously 'memory', but a calendar is relatively simple. But there's lot of temporal data one might want; TODO lists, augmented with dates and reminders. A passive calendar can't do that.

But the reminders can be much more complex than 'send an email on March 26'. Arbitrarily complex reminders are useful. Consider the [phenomenon](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/21/AR2010042104578.html) of [iPhone applications](!Wikipedia) aimed at men, which track a woman's menstrual cycle and predict when they are [PMSing](!Wikipedia); this can be very useful for men as they know when to be extra-thoughtful and forgiving.

Now, what does the iPhone add? Nothing stops men from [using spreadsheets](http://www.slate.com/id/2248580/pagenum/all/) to track menstrual cycles, but few did before. Spreadsheets even take most of the work out of it. So why do the men using iPhone applications seem somehow less creepy and more understandable than the men using spreadsheets on their desktops? Because the effort involved is lower, and it is more useful. (One can believe that a low-effort-high-payoff program like an iPhone application is genuine; but a high-effort-low-payoff desktop spreadsheet makes one wonder what else the man is getting out of it, and thoughts turn to undefined sexual perversions.)
