Criticisms of Wikipedia tend to fall into 2 categories - the clueless and the cliche. Either they are based on lack of knowledge (Wikipedia steals your copyright, Wikipedia pages can't be reliably cited etc.), or they are obvious if you think about how wikis work (I saw some vandalism the other day, this article isn't very good, I think this topic shouldn't be covered at all) and have been written about and covered with mind-numbing frequency.

The Wikimedia Commons project tends to attract the former[^criticism]. For example, people criticize it for not supporting Flash, for only supporting Ogg & Theora media files, for using a Java applet for playback, for supporting only Firefox's <tt>\<video\>\<\\video\></tt> tags...

# Commons and videos

But the stupidest I've seen in a long time has to be the criticism that the Foundation is wasting the hard-earned money of donors by not hosting videos on YouTube[^idiot].

The levels of failure in this criticism are many and considerable. Wikipedia will never, ever host things on YouTube unless YouTube makes some considerable changes. (Heck, the Wikipedian community views merely linking to YouTube content [with distaste](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links/YouTube).)

## YouTube's software sucks

From a technical standpoint, YouTube is a *terrible* partner:

1) Its interface is cluttered and poor.
2) It is not localized to the over 200 languages the MediaWiki engine supports[^localization]
3) It does not support basic features important to Wikipedians, like the trivial ability to *download* the files.
    - More specifically, one can download the [FLV](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Flash_Video) file,
      but this file is not the original file! The metadata is gone, a vast amount of resolution (audio & visual) is
      destroyed in the encoding, and YouTube reportedly does still other lossy processing.
4) It does not support large files. Wikimedia Commons supports files up to 100 megabytes and more; file sizes this large are absolutely necessary in order to handle video files of any reasonable length.
    - The 10 minutes length, and the other size and length limits, all render YouTube unsuitable from the start.
      One goal of Commons is to be _archival_, in the sense of providing originals (new Free content) and faithful
      reproductions; otherwise the project simply cannot meet its goals as an educational resource.
      Grainy 320^2^ pixel 5-minute videos are simply unacceptable.
5) It does not support metadata.
    i. The existing YouTube support for metadata is pitiful. The uploader, the date, a few words of summary, and perhaps some other items like whether it's a 'video response' to something. The overall impression is really sad. YouTube comments are [legendarily](http://xkcd.com/202/) [stupid](http://xkcd.com/481/); they don't have to be - there isn't even a simple ranking, it's just new comments displace older ones. That YouTube hasn't implemented any better system (even Slashdot circa 1997 had a better comment system) speaks volumes.
    ii. MediaWiki, on the other hand, supports metadata very well (to an arbitrary degree, in fact, because of the template system). Commons has a wonderful library-like culture of checking images, adding metadata, and organizing media. If files were to be put on YouTube, it would lead to a metadata holocaust. There's simply nowhere to put it in YouTube.
6) Its software is not free. Flash is not free. YouTube's systems are not free. Neither's source is even available in any shape or form. This alone would rule out YouTube as a possible partner.
    - Why? One of the fundamental tenets of Wikipedia is that it will be 'user-friendly' in the best sense. There won't be any business or profit-driven bullshit that gets in the way of producing stuff. This means as little bureaucratic or financial overhead as possible.
    - This view has major consequences. For example, the content will be available and *usable* by everyone: commercial users[^comm], bankrupt users, *everyone*. Flash and the audio/video codecs are not available to everyone (including commercial users). They are encumbered with licensing restrictions and royalty payments, and are illegal to modify or change in any way. Suppose someone wanted to distribute DVDs of Commons videos and music files; if they used MP3s and other such encumbered formats, who will pay the owners[^owners] their pound of flesh?

Further reasons could be adduced, but I hope it's clear after 6 points that in order to become an acceptable host, YouTube would have to be completely rewritten.

## YouTube's service sucks

But let's say that we've given up on the idea of YouTube as a 'primary' host. Couldn't perhaps we still put up secondary backups, for people who like using YouTube instead of Commons, and don't mind the (very) limited selection and quality? It wouldn't even have to be any official liaison between the Wikimedia Foundation and YouTube - just a few users selecting videos, compressing, and uploading.

Sadly, even this is completely impossible. At least, if you care about things like copyright laws.

You see, YouTube claims legal rights over uploaded content that are incompatible with the GFDL. They are, in fact, incompatible with just about every copyleft license out there. You can't comply with their Terms of Service (TOS) and also upload a GFDL'd video[^copyright].

Why not? Well, let's look at paragraph 10 of the [YouTube TOS](http://youtube.com/t/terms) (emphasis added):


> When you upload or post a User Submission to YouTube, you grant:
>  1. to YouTube, a *worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable licence (with right to sub-licence) to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of*, display, and perform that User Submission in connection with the provision of the Services and otherwise in connection with the provision of the Website and YouTube's business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Website (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels;

Now, remember the essential characteristic of a copyleft license, their legal judo move: every derivative work must be licensed under at least the same license as the original, and be at least as unrestricted as it. So if I have a GFDL video, every derivative of it - and itself - must always be under the GFDL. The waters can get muddy here with multi-licensing changes, but this is the part that matters here.

Now, if I give you a GFDL video, you don't own the copyright. You merely have a license from me which lets you do a lot of things with the video only so long as you give the video away as a GFDL'd video. So, how is it possible for you to grant YouTube any license which is *not* the GFDL? You can't do it! You aren't allowed - if you try to, you break your GFDL contract, and now it's illegal for you to give YouTube the video in any form. The issue isn't that YouTube is making you give them the right to do just about anything[^theft] with your uploads, but rather that they won't accept the GFDL.

YouTube will change this paragraph of their Terms of Service when hell freezes over.

# Summing up

So, YouTube is grossly inappropriate technically. It is impossible legally. And it would be of dubious utility anyway, as spending on servers and bandwidth is a fairly small fraction of the Foundation's budget[^it]. Hosting Commons videos on YouTube is an impressive stinker of an idea, the kind of idea which displays fractal cruddiness - the more you look at specific details, the worse it gets. Which is not to say there aren't liaisons out there that make sense for Wikimedia Commons (for example, the Internet Archive has a similar ideology, with a good archival approach, and the media collections overlap), but it's safe to say that commercial services are unlikely to make good partners. If I had to generalize from YouTube, the lesson to be drawn is:

> A profitable site is not a user-friendly site.


[^comm]: One problem with considering commercial users is that everyone instantly thinks of large abusive corporations and feels the urge to use only NC licenses. The problem is that while NC licenses would indeed punish large abusive corporations (assuming they care), there are many 'commercial' users who don't seem commercial at all but would still be banned by such a license. There are other reasons of course; see ["The Case for Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License"](http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC) for more.
[^copyright]: There is one way you could get around it - if you own the entire copyright on the uploaded video. Then your upload would be interpreted as an upload not of a copyleft-licensed-video, but of an all-rights-reserved video, since that's the only way the TOS would be satisfiable.
[^criticism]: Which is better than attracting the former, because at least you can correct people; but what do you say do the millionth iteration of "Wikipedia shouldn't be used because anyone can edit it and it's unreliable"?
[^idiot]: This charge was made by a real person; to protect the guilty, the message will not be linked to.
