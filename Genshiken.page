...

    They argue harshly -
    but then, does ink hate paper?
    or paper the ink?

    Do not be misled!
    Their books are camouflage for
    the red strings of fate
    that they have shyly forged
    over the years, side by side.

    Sure that none would
    ever read the book again
    he still wrote those notes,
    sure that those thoughts were worth thought
    and would find a home some day.

    Go, tell the others
    on campus, in the clubroom,
    that at Comiket -
    despite the blistering sun -
    the flowers of dreams yet bloom.

    In just this one day,
    I experienced so much!
    So how is it, then
    That the weeks and months before
    remain dim and forgotten?

    This day in the line,
    groaning and laughing with friends,
    the world forgotten,
    I must not forget later
    when I am sorting all my goods.

    When I look upon
    the bales of abandoned books,
    I am saddened: by
    an enthusiastic pen,
    drawing for so many nights.

    Where the otaku
    have all vanished from the stairs
    and its rope linings,
    now stars pass the long night and
    papers rustle in the breeze.

    And with what shall I
    compare us?
                  A boy walking
    through the warm spring night,
    as he leaves his friends, knowing
    just how few partings remain.
