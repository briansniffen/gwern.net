When I came across this quote, I was struck by its relevance to one of [Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia)'s 'beisutsukai' posts about finding the successor to quantum mechanics, ["The Failures of Eld Science"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/q9/the_failures_of_eld_science/).

I meant to write an essay on how interesting it is that we intellectually know that many of our current theories must be wrong, and even have pretty good ideas as to which ones, but we still cannot psychologically tackle them with the same energy as if we had some anomaly or paradox to explain, or have the benefit of hindsight. The students in Eliezer's story know that quantum mechanics is wrong; someone with a well-verified observation contradicting quantum mechanics knows that it is wrong (replace 'quantum' with 'classical' as you wish). They will achieve better results than a battalion of conventional QMists.

But nothing quite gelled.

> "- for over thirty years," Jeffreyssai said.  "Not one of them saw it; not Einstein, not SchrÃ¶dinger, not even von Neumann."  He turned away from his sketcher, and toward the classroom.  "I pose to you to the question:  How did they fail?"

> Brennan didn't jump.  He deliberately waited just long enough to show he wasn't scared, and then said, "Lack of pragmatic motivation, sensei."

> "The Manhattan Project," Brennan said, "was launched with a specific technological end in sight: a weapon of great power, in time of war.  But the error that Eld Science committed with respect to quantum physics had no immediate consequences for their technology. They were confused, but they had no desperate need for an answer.  Otherwise the surrounding system would have removed all burdens from their effort to solve it.  Surely the Manhattan Project must have done so - Taji?  Do you know?"

> Jeffreyssai chuckled slightly.  "Don't guess so hard what I might prefer to hear, Competitor.  Your first statement came closer to my hidden mark; your oh-so-Bayesian disclaimer fell wide...  The factor I had in mind, Brennan, was that Eld scientists thought it was acceptable to take thirty years to solve a problem.  Their entire social process of science was based on getting to the truth eventually. A wrong theory got discarded eventually - once the next generation of students grew up familiar with the replacement.  Work expands to fill the time allotted, as the saying goes.  But people can think important thoughts in far less than thirty years, if they expect speed of themselves." Jeffreyssai suddenly slammed down a hand on the arm of Brennan's chair.  "How long do you have to dodge a thrown knife?"

--- They didn't *know* that they were looking for a better theory.

The students in this story have the incredible advantage that they are starting from a wrong theory and know this for certain, and not merely suspect or hold as a general philosophy-of-science principle 'there's probably a better theory than the current one'. This gives them several things psychologically:

1) the willingness to scrap painfully won insights and theories in favor of something new and
2) saves them from spending all their time and effort patching up the old theory.

I know in the past when I've tried my hand at problems (logic puzzles come to mind) that I am far more motivated and effective when I am assured that there is in fact a correct answer than when I am unsure the question is even answerable.

And a quick note to those who think I'm echoing Brennan: I am, here, but my point differs in that I don't think it was a matter of 'training'.

I think if you abducted all the old greats, gave the necessary experimental data, and gave them a few months to produce the new theory before they were dragged out to the shed and shot, then they could do it just as well as these students. It's all about motivation.

It's not a matter of competency at paradigm shifts, if you will; it's accepting that one needs to happen *now* and you are the one who needs to do it. But there's no normal way to convince a scientific community of this; isn't it true that most new paradigms fail to pan out?

From ["Class Project"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/qt/class_project/):

> Jeffreyssai took a moment to look over his increasingly disturbed students, "Here is your assignment.  Of quantum mechanics, and General Relativity, you have been told.  This is the limit of Eld science, and hence, the limit of public knowledge.  The five of you, working on your own, are to produce the correct theory of quantum gravity.  Your time limit is one month."

> Ordinarily, at this point, I would say:  "Now I am about to tell you the answer; so if you want to try to work out the problem on your own, you should do so now."  But in this case, some of the greatest statisticians in history did not get it on their own, so if you do not already know the answer, I am not really expecting you to work it out.  Maybe if you remember half a hint, but not the whole answer, you could try it on your own.  Or if you suspect that your era will support you, you could try it on your own; I have given you a tremendous amount of help by asking exactly the correct question, and telling you that an answer is possible.
