### Plot

In 3.0, Mari will attend school as a regular student. <http://animekritik.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/evangelion-2-0/#comment-3348> (Seems unlikely to me; is there even a school left for her to attend? Aren't the Children all busy being locked up or recovering from infection or hiding? On the other hand, the CRC shows a draft in which she *did* show up in school in _2.0_, so clearly they wanted to.)

At some point in the last 2 movies Mari will say 'anta baka?'

Asuka will be employed by SEELE against NERV or Shinji

The name change to Shikinami will receive no in-universe explanation.

In 3.0, Asuka will have been promoted
