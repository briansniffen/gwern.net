Polyphasic sleep record
I have gotten a normal amount of sleep, and 0 of I'm ready to start.
I've decided on a 3 hour schedule: half-hour naps at 1, 5, and 9 AM/PM. This currently seems to work well with my schedule and is easy to remember.

Day 1
So, how did it go? Somewhat mixed. The AM naps went fine, although I suspect I got very little actual sleep. Mentally, I was a bit fuzzy, but not nearly as bad as I had expected; the fuzziness was actually on par with my normal nightshift-caused sleepiness. But the 1 PM nap went awful, as I quite ignored my alarm and slept for 2 hours. The 5 PM nap lasted 1.5 hours, but I think that was due to an improperly set alarm clock.

Day 2
1 AM nap resulted in little sleep, as before. I find myself at 4 AM anxious for the 5 AM nap to come, and a little annoyed; this may be due to the rain confining me in the hut and inadequacies of my laptop. 5 AM nap delayed to 5:55, and then I slept until about 6:30 or 6:40 AM. Rain continues. I merged the 9 AM and 1 PM naps into a 11-12 PM block. The 5 PM nap went fine; but I could not nap at 9 PM since I simply had to watch _Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark_ with everyone else. So I decided to push it back to midnight.

Day 3
I combined Day 2's 9 PM nap with today's 1 AM nap; so I slept from 12 AM to around 12:50, at which point I decided to get up. Oddly, my alarm did not seem to go off. I am mentally fine, but I worry that the long naps and oversleeping may be making the entire point moot, so I am going to try to keep a better tally of time - if I go much over 3 hours a day, that will be a warning to tighten things up. Regardless, the 5 AM nap went quite well; I am almost certain I went straight to REM sleep towards the end, and I managed to overcome the strong urge to keep laying there. Unfortunately, the 9 AM nap, as usual, was a failure. I slept a good 2 or 3 hours. So if I stick to the schedule, I'm only down to 6 hours a day - which is better than the 8 or 9 I was wasting before, but still not satisfying. 5 PM nap: fine. 9 PM nap: I'm not sure, but I was laying there like a corpse until 11 o'clock (2 hours). It could've either been my alarm, which seemed to be set to 12:33, or oversleeping although I would've sworn I was conscious the entire time, just daydreaming the minutes away.

Day 4
I'm going to try harder today to stick to my schedule. I have things to do like scheduling an appointment and visiting the library and getting rid of all that excess junk, so perhaps they will supply motivation which, to be frank, was lacking yesterday. Mental acuity: pretty high. 1 AM: not particularly satisfactory. 5 AM nap: satisfactory. 9 AM nap: lasted until 3 PM. Dammit. It may be the weekend, and I may've blown today's sleep budget, but I am going to try, try again. I obviously skipped the 1 PM nap, and I took the 5 PM nap at 5:30, and the 9 PM nap at 9:30. Both went fine.

Day 5
1 AM: fine. Lay there for a few minutes, but got up.
5 AM: U; little restfulness.
9 AM: S, but possibly lasted to 10:30
1:30 PM: S (quite vivid and complex dreams), but lasted to 3 PM
5 PM nap: S, though broken up over 3 hours thanks to chores, the Belmont, dinner...
9 PM: S

Analysis
I seem to be averaging about 4-5 hours of sleep a night when the often disastrous 9 AM and 1 PM naps are factored in. This is better than the 9 hours I would normally sleep, but progress needs to be made.

Today marks a full month since I started the 6-nap/half-hour program. It's been interesting, but I want to try going to full Uberman: 6-naps/20-minutes. So today I'll rest up as a reward and start tonight/tomorrow. (Same time-schedule - the naps are just shorter, not fewer. Although I might try later a 4-nap/half-hour schedule to see how well that works.)

This seems like a good day to switch schedules again. It technically is not the end of the month, but unfortunately, Month 2 is useless as data; the data is polluted. Why? Well, I foolishly attempted to also experiment with a wooden pillow (mixed success), and simultaneously changing my sleeping posture (from sleeping on my side to sleeping on my back). In addition, I had no choice but to begin a running program towards the end, which tired me out and totally screwed up my sleep patterns. So I'll just call it quits at the 20 day mark.

Day 51
This month I'll still try the 2-hours-total criterion which is unique to Uberman, but I'm going to do it as 4 naps of 1/2 hours, and not 6 naps of 1/3 hours; the 2 naps will be at 3 and 9 (AM & PM). I start today, although I slept in as a treat.

Day 54
A side note; I find it really hard to get up after these naps, even though they are pretty restful once I get up and stop feeling suicidal. These and previous timings don't mention the half-hour I spend lying there awake getting the gumption to go and do something instead of sleeping. I suppose this is the standard sleep deprivation part.

Day 98

I have decided to try to add a little more rigor to this experiment. I happen to have a copy of 'ThinkFast'. Every day I am going to run through its tests once and record it here. I emphasize that I am perfectly aware that the results are, in terms of actual functioning, meaningless - but presumably they will still be a little valid for measuring mental alertness from day to day (and hopefully the low-level mental functioning it is measuring will be a proxy for more important high-level functions).
I'm not sure what program to use. I was going to use ThinkFast's IQ test, but unfortunately that repeats each time and so is useless; worse, it crashes WINE on some tests.. I think I will record overall results from gbrainy. I would use Mnemosyne statistics, but it doesn't provide them in a useful format.

I've decided to try again. This time I will be doing 20 minute naps every 6 hours. I've reflected on my past attempt and I think part of the issue may've been falling too fast asleep. Another modification is that I will try to have some caffeine after each nap; caffeine is absorbed within 30 minutes and metabolized within about 120 minutes, so it does not endanger the next nap. The final change I will be making is to routinize my use of Gbrainy. I've looked at my scores from when I was using it before, and  I see minimal overall improvement from practice; so it should make as good a benchmark of my psychological acuity as I am likely to find. To prevent it being a chore, I'll cut back to 10 games (instead of 20). The schedule will be 10, 2, 6.
