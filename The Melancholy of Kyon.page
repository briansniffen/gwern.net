The real joy of reading [Gene Wolfe](!Wikipedia) is not so much for his imaginative plots^[Though it's hard to argue that works of his like _[The Fifth Head of Cerberus](!Wikipedia)_ or _[The Book of the New Sun](!Wikipedia)_ do not have fascinating stories and settings.] or for his masterly prose^[The reason I began reading Gene Wolfe was because I idly picked up his _[The Shadow of the Torturer](!Wikipedia)_ and began reading for half an hour. 2 or 3 chapters into the book, I ran into a scene set in an ancient library. The librarian begins describing his wares, and the prose reaches a level I rarely see outside of such great authors as Oscar Wilde or Sir Thomas Browne..... TODO: insert Ultan quote], but rather for the secret gems his stories conceal.

Many Wolfe stories follow the pattern of telling some remarkable story, which an ordinary reader can follow and enjoy with pleasure, and when they reach the end, they are satisfied. But a more devoted or perceptive reader will find far more than that^[Sometimes they can find *too* much; consider the many interpretations of "[Suzanne Delage]()".]. (One thinks of Shakespeare, and how his plays change on re-reading.)

One reads through _Peace_ and is amused and interested by Aldon Weer's reminiscences of 1900s Midwestern life; one re-reads it, and is troubled to discover that Weer is a ghost and his anecdotes conceal a murder (perhaps multiple murders) for which he yet moulders in his grave - that far from being idyllic, _Peace_ is better described as a horror story.

One reads through the diary that is the last third of _The Fifth Head of Cerberus_, and one ponders a little about anthropological expeditions. The second time through, perhaps, one notices an inconsistency and realizes that the anthropologist is murdered and replaced half way through. And so on.

Gene Wolfe says that he writes for an educated reader^[The irony of course being that Wolfe's allusions and discourse range so widely that one would have to be a pansophist or replicate his reading exactly to follow each and every reference],

> "My definition of good literature is that which can be read by an educated reader, and reread with increased pleasure."[](http://www.locusmag.com/2002/Issue09/GaimanWolfe.html)

Regardless of where Wolfe's true greatness lies, reading him inculcates an active mindset. In normal fiction, one passively consumes the interpretations and descriptions of the narrator. With Wolfe's unreliable narrators, this is impossible. Reading normal fiction with a Wolfean mindset sometimes leads to interesting results. I'd like to show a personal example.

# _The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya_

Some time ago, in 2006, a short high school drama/comedy anime was released called _[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](!Wikipedia)_. (Yes, *another* one.) This one was a little unusual as it was based on an extremely popular [light novel](!Wikipedia) series of the same name, and it became the most popular anime of the year, an instant classic.

## Plot

The basic plot goes that Kyon, our skeptical but solid ordinary (non-dweeb) guy, has just started high school. When the members of his new class introduce themselves^[Japanese high schools are not like American high schools in this respect; classes stay together as they rotate through the subjects.], one attractive girl sitting in front of Kyon (the eponymous Haruhi) makes the declaration that she seeks interesting & unusual beings such as "aliens, time travelers, ghosts, demons, ESPers". In short, she's a weirdo. Kyon is interested in her, and eventually offhandedly suggests that she form a club for such beings. She takes him up on it, and applying the trademark Haruhi brand of arrogance, slyness, and impetuosity, rounds up 3 members besides herself and Kyon: Mikuru, a buxom red-headed upperclassmen; Itsuki, who likes to egg on Haruhi; and Yuki, a small quiet girl who is always reading.

As they go about their random club activities dictated by Haruhi, Kyon is startled to discover that each of the other club members is such a being as Haruhi desired; and that further, the reason for this is that Haruhi is in fact the god who created and controls the universe he lives in. As she is entirely unaware of her true nature & powers, her primary focus is on having fun as a schoolgirl; the 3 uncanny beings have set their face on granting Haruhi her wish, and have enlisted Kyon in the mission.

Haruhi, though a [tsundere](!Wikipedia)^[Haruhi is one of the paradigmatic _tsundere_ characters; consider a quote from episode 1: "Feelings of love are just a temporary lapse in judgement. Like a mental illness."], begins to fall in love with Kyon, and vice versa. At the end of the original broadcast, she feels rejected and begins to destroy the world in favor of a new & more satisfying one, but Kyon manages to convince her that he returns her affection.

### Sequence

One unique aspect of _Haruhi_ is that there are 2 orders in which to play the episodes. The first is the sequence in which it was broadcast, the 'Haruhi' sequence. This sequence jumps around - for example, the first episode is a indie movie made for the school's [Japanese Cultural Festival](!Wikipedia), which chronologically belongs toward the end of the series. The second is the logical, chronological order ('Kyon' order).

The reason for the Haruhi order is that the original series was 14 episodes. So the creators ([Kyoto Animation](!Wikipedia)) had to draw on material from multiple books. But each light novel is structured normally: beginning, middle, climax, end. The series would feel a little odd to have multiple arcs, cutting out in the middle. Their solution was to focus on the story arc of the first light novel, which culminates in Haruhi and Kyon's first kiss, and leave that as the *last* episode (Haruhi order). What was to be done with all the episodes that chronologically would come after the kiss? They simply stuck them into the beginning and middle!

So the Haruhi order keeps the story arc over the 14 episodes intact, which provides a real ending (a very good & rare thing; see my [Death Note Ending]()), and also accomplishes a number of neat things: it's original; it provides foreshadowing; it involves the viewer in trying to understand and piece together the plot; and it renders scenes freshly poignant or just *different* the second time around.

You can understand why I slipped into Wolfe-mode watching _Haruhi_.

## Problems

The inner story in Wolfe is manifested most often in lies, inconsistencies, or peculiarities of characters. Characters act rationally and in realistic ways. They eat, defecate, sleep, and so on, in a precise timeline. Wolfe makes it a point of pride to have few accidental errors. When you notice one, it's usually there to make a point.

### Timing

The second time through, I noticed something odd about the setup. The other characters tell Kyon that they've existed and have been observing Haruhi for 3 years at that point.

Isn't there something strange about this? 3 years and they haven't made contact themselves, nor has Haruhi subconsciously forced them to take action that might interest her. For that matter, isn't it a little strange that Haruhi might create such creatures and *not know* about them? How is it interesting or fun to live in a world with time travelers and aliens and ESPers if one doesn't know of them at all?

A further problem is that Haruhi tells Kyon a story from her childhood, and the crushing existential angst it inspired:

> "I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him, "Do you know how many people are here right now"? He said since the stadium was full, probably fifty thousand...I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all."

She then vowed to make life interesting. But this was during middle school. Why then does life only become interesting in *high* school, three years later? The timeframe seems more than a little odd.

Haruhi may've acted weird - fellow classmates note that she had a reputation even in middle school - but Yuki tells Kyon that in those three years, nothing peculiar or godly occurred.

### Uncertain identity

> _[thinking]_ "The passing train gave me a moment to think about my response. Should I voice an opposing viewpoint? Maybe I should wax philosophical about her dilemma."<br>
> _[aloud]_ "...I see."<br>
> _[thinking]_ "I must be getting melancholic if that's the best I could come up with." --Kyon, episode 5

Another curious point is that the evidence of Haruhi's divine nature is so meager. The 'Data Integration Entity' (a massive AI apparently modeled after the TechnoCore from [Dan Simmons](!Wikipedia)'s _[Hyperion Cantos](!Wikipedia)_) says only that Haruhi is at the center of the anomalies TODO. Yuki also tells Kyon that Haruhi's 'true identity remains unknown' TODO, and that the whole 'data explosion' is 'impossible to analyze'. So Haruhi being godlike may be a good guess - but from the AI perspective, it's just a guess.

Itsuki and the ESPers are little more help. They fight various sub-dimensions whose appearances are correlated with emotional disturbances in Haruhi - but correlation is not causation.

The time travelers as represented by Mikuru are even less help. She speaks only of a barrier in time, and has little justification for believing Haruhi god.

### Minimal power

Indeed, the other characters manifest far more power than Haruhi. Nagato can create and break into sub-dimensions and do nearly arbitrary things there; she also has 1337 hacking skills and can modify ordinary objects like baseball bats to have extraordinary powers. Itsuki becomes a superhero in sub-dimensions, able to fly and shoot energy. Mikuru as a time traveler can have future selves show up and render aid (in addition to any future weaponry, which she may or may not possess).

What does Haruhi do? Well, there are the sub-dimensions filled with rampaging monsters. But that's not clearly Haruhi's doing. There is a mysterious shadow on the desert island as they leave, but that's not much.

### Losses

Haruhi is often defeated or set back:

- Founding the club, she is swiftly prevented from advertising it while wearing a [bunny suit](!Wikipedia).
- In episode 5, while drawing lots for wandering about the city and looking for strange events to investigate, Haruhi twice gets the wrong stick and so isn't pair off with Kyon.  This deeply angers her. But what sort of god can't even influence a random draw when she really wants to?
- The one truly mysterious case the club investigates, Haruhi is completely cut out of.
- In the desert island episode, episode 06, Haruhi suggests that there be a murder mystery, and in particular, that the master murder. Mikuru. Kyon vetoes it. Nothing happens to Mikuru.<br>
    Indeed, in the 2 desert island episodes, Haruhi's detective skills and wishing fail. No real murders happen, and certainly not the way she suggested.

## The real story

So we may be convinced by now that something is going on. (Or we may not be; plausibly, each of these could be explained by something like an error, or artistic license etc.)

But what is the real story? It could be anything, from what really happened to who characters really are. In Wolfe, though, deception tends to focus on characters and issues of identity. In _Peace_, Weer is not what you think he is. In _The Book of the New Sun_, characters like Dorcas are not who they appear to be (random stranger, but really the protagonist's grandmother). So what character should we be most suspicious of?

Haruhi.

### Why Kyon?

If Haruhi is not the god, then who is?

I believe the god is really Kyon.

All throughout the series, Kyon is as much of an anomaly as Haruhi. We are told this quite directly:

> "The biggest mystery would be you." (Koizumi to Kyon.)

Even bigger than Haruhi, eh?

As well, Kyon is one of the 2 people who has not "shown me honest proof of their identity".

Kyon *claims* to be an ordinary high school student, but he's much like Haruhi. In the introduction, he tells us that he was once obsessed with the same subjects as Haruhi - but he gave them up on entering high school (that is, 3 years ago, while in middle school).

#### _Cui bono?_

Many of the otherwise peculiar events become explicable when considered from a Kyon-kami perspective.

The curious 3 year gap? Kyon had vowed that high school would be different. TODO: find vow quote.

Nagato's observation that nothing unusual had happened during those 3 years, until high school started (and Kyon was around)? Explained, if Haruhi has no powers.

The desert island incident? Kyon didn't want there to be any *real* murders, but he was still very interested. Witness his constant conversation and thinking on the topic. He is also the one who solves the mystery, and claims to've suspected the answer from the start. Is this combination of knowing the answer, being involved, and having fun really consistent with the Haruhi-kami hypothesis?

Let's consider some other things that suggest the universe is designed for Haruhi and not Kyon. The club would seem to be the best example - doesn't it just impose on Kyon?

It is true that Haruhi enjoys the club, but ultimately she is not the instigator and main beneficiary of events. As Koizumi points out, Kyon suggested the club, and Kyon falls in love with Haruhi from the start.

In the universe of _Haruhi_, the answer for the [theodicy](!Wikipedia) is that God is very human and is imperfect. Further, it is capable of the usual range of emotions: every character plausibly suggested to be God can apparently evince pleasure, anger, shame, etc. Thus, it is at least possible that this god might create a creature to do what he'd be too embarrassed to do. In this light, we must ask ''cui bono?'' when it comes to Haruhi's treatment of her and Mikuru Asahina's bodies.

I contend that Haruhi does not - as she derives no gratification from it, not being a lesbian, nor does she really care about Mikuru apart from her utility to the SOS Brigade (she's a lackey, a rival, or a plaything) - but there is another major character who is both greatly pleased by Haruhi's actions and shamed by his pleasure. We can tie this line of thought to larger concerns: is it not true that fans enjoy anime in part because things happen in the anime that would never happen in real life (see: [harem anime](!Wikipedia)s), or that we would ever actually do (see: martial arts, action, and sports anime)?

For an anime, those who are gratified are the fans and creators, who stand to the anime in respect of god. The analogy for TMoHS is clear.

More prosaic examples of the true beneficiary of events might include Haruhi obtaining a computer; who winds up using it and creating the SOS Brigade website? Kyon.

Or, consider one of the examples in the Losses section: Haruhi wanted to be with Kyon, but on the other hand, Kyon likes Mikuru (whom he went with the first time), and had good reason to want to be alone with Nagato, who had only recently revealed her true nature to him. Under the Kyon-kami interpretation, Haruhi losing the draw is expected.

#### Explaining Haruhi

> "If there's really that many people in the world, then there had to be someone who wasn't ordinary. There had to be someone who was living an interesting life. There just _had_ to be. Why wasn't I that person?" --Haruhi, episode 5

This might seem to leave Haruhi unexplained - just some random girl who acted weirdly, and whom Kyon happened to make his stalking horse. But looked at with the right eye, Kyon admits as much:

> "In a way, doesn't that make me an insider to this mysterious event? Just as I said in the beginning, I had wanted to be a bystander that got sucked into these events, content with being a mere sidekick. But as things stood, I was already the protagonist! That's right, I had really wished I was a character in a story involving aliens, but when I'd really become one, it put everything into perspective. To be honest, I'm quite troubled by it."^[[Chapter 5](http://www.baka-tsuki.net/project/index.php?title=Suzumiya_Haruhi:Volume1_Full_Text)]

He only wanted to be a bystander, or a sidekick. But as presented, Haruhi is the protagonist. Hmm...

##### Just another love story

> "Sometimes I get the feeling that we're all just a bunch of clowns standing on our tiptoes at the edge of a great abyss." --Itsuki, episode 5

Are you ready to go all the way down the wolf den? Here's the full story:

Is it so hard to believe that a god might fall in love with an unusual girl, and seek to create a world she could be happy in and love him back? The scenario in which Haruhi unknowingly creates the world and the paranormal factions and in which Kyon comes to be crucial and confided in by them is actually more complex than the one in which he creates a world to keep her happy by allowing for the SOS Brigade to form with the members necessary to carry out its functions and puts her at the center of things, but nevertheless Kyon-kami would want to know and participate in events. He couldn't enjoy the club as he did if he were in the ignorant Haruhi's position.

To put it another way, supposing the Kyon-kami hypothesis were true, the premise of the story (the strange life of an unwitting god) would still be perfectly true. But then it wouldn't just be *all* the characters who are unwitting - even the audience wouldn't be in on the trick.

What a joke!

#### Misc. points

- Kyon is the narrator, as befits the tutelary deity of the anime
- From day one, it is Kyon who approaches Haruhi and not the other way around. In the final episode, Haruhi comes to realize she is happy with the world as it is and with her friends and Kyon. This averts the imminent Armageddon, but is it that God was pleased and changed her mind, or that God was glad that Haruhi had found a world she could be happy in, and so he refrained from changing things?
- Another way to put it is like this: if everyone and everything that is happening happens at Haruhi's wish, then how did she come to wish for Kyon when she doesn't even begin to switch from _tsun_ to _dere_ entire episodes in? Shouldn't Kyon's repeated declarations that he is utterly ordinary and hopes for a life of utter ordinariness make us suspicious? Shouldn't it bother us that Kyon obviously hopes deep down for  and admits as much (episode 2)? Shouldn't it bother us that the 'melancholy' of the title could as easily be Kyon's?
- Misc. notes on episode 14: Kyon precedes Haruhi to the dream world, and obviously knows a lot more about it than she. When the two are arguing, Haruhi doesn't say that she herself was bored and fed up with the old world, but claims that Kyon was. TODO
