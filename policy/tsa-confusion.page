title: The TSA is deeply confused
description: TSA terrorizes American citizens

On the way out of Logan's terminal A this week, I saw two signs
immediately adjacent.  The first said that due to an elevated security
condition of ORANGE, no liquids could be brought through security or
onto a plane.  The second said that liquids could be brought through
in a single one quart bag containing three-ounce containers.  Between
them was a scowling TSA officer, periodically and loudly instructing
passengers to read all signs regarding transport of liquids, firearms,
and similar dangerous devices.

He didn't seem to want his picture taken, so I do not have one to show
you.  But surely this is an experiment in how miserable citizens can
be made.  They can't accidentally have two signs like that up one next to
another.  And the local TSA chief can't do something that twistedly
awful on his own authority.  The directive to do so must have come
down from the central TSA bureaucracy, perhaps at the level of unified
DHS.
