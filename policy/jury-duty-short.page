This morning I answered a summons to serve as a Juror in the trial
courts of the Commonwealth.  I was fortunate to be assigned to the
Concord courts: well-appointed, with clean bathrooms and broad
windows.  It was nicer than my last experience, in Lowell.  I'm told
Lowell is nicer still than Cambridge.

In the short informative video which started off the morning, we
discovered that Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall of the Supreme
Judicial Court has a [very great friend in Rome][].  But the rest of
the talk was mildly useful, reminding everybody what reasonable doubt
means.  It never did explain *why* some juries are six and some twelve.

I was empanelled on a Jury in a domestic violence case.  The defense
threw out all the women on the jury.  The trial then lasted all of
fifteen minutes: opening statements, then twenty words of testimony
from the first witness.  As soon as the defendant saw that she was
actually willing to testify that he'd hit her, he caved.  The plea
bargain took another hour, then they let us go.

It's nice to see the system working so well.  This seems to be exactly
what ought to have happened in an adversarial system.
