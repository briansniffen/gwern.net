title: Prediction Market Maps
---

Lance Fortnow, a scholar of computational complexity, has put together
a map integrating Tradesports data on Senatorial and Gubernatorial
races.  You can see it at <http://www.fortnow.com/governor/> and
<http://www.fortnow.com/senate/>.  The predicted governors are most
interesting to me.  This doesn't look like a Red State/Blue State map.
This has Republicans in California, Vermont, and Connecticut.  There
are Democrats across the Mid-West, even down into Tennessee and
Arkansas.

If the parties are as all dominating as the media represents, and the
nation as polarized as we've been told, this shouldn't happen.  This
map, often showing different parties winning the local and national
races, shows a healthy polity.

The Senate map is less excellent, but still far from bad.  Only
Missouri has a tightly contested race.  On the other hand, it's not
like these are percentages of voters: they're colored based on the
perceived probability of an outcome.  An absolute certainty of a 51/49
election will be bright blue or red.

Where's all this healthy political intermingling coming from?  Why is
sushi-eating Times-reading Connecticut electing a Republican?  Why is
Oklahoma electing a Democrat?  I'm hesitant to read too much from one
complicated datum.  But perhaps the problem isn't the parties, or
the Bush-hating ANSWER minority, or the crypto-fascist
anything-Bush-says minority.  Maybe it's Washington, D.C. Maybe we can
have less-polarized politics out in the states, but not when three
hundred million people are being represented by less than six hundred.

(It is also worth noting that none of these races are gerrymandered,
their borders having been drawn when America had something better to
do than squabble in the sandbox.)
