title: Propaganda

[Propaganda][path] is [propaganda][fahrenheit].  I have little respect
for those who supported [one][fahrenheit] and now condemn
[another][path]: what's good for the goose and all that.  I'm not much
happier with those who condemned the [first][fahrenheit] as propaganda
and fiction and now celebrate a [more convenient fictionalization][path].

Both were distributed by Disney (one by Miramax, one by ABC).  Both
are labelled as docudramas or dramatizations.  Both caricature
otherwise defensible positions---that President Clinton should have
done more to stop particular Islamic terrorists in the eight and a
half years between February 26, 1993 and September 11, 2001, including
military strikes against those terrorists senior generals; and that
President Bush has pursued a number of goals more related to
authoritarian control than to defense of America.

Neither is a reasonable basis for a discussion of the course of our
nation.  Neither is a useful text for national dialogue.  They are
interesting only as artifacts of our polarized political culture and
of the regrettable merger of public-service news and public circuses
into that gibbering beast called The Media.

**Update**: Whoever generated this [trailer][] for 9/11 is presenting it
  as the "official true story".  It *looks* like that's ABC.
