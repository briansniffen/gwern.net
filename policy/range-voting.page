title: Range Voting from the MIT Alumni Association
description: Gerrymandering and algorithmic redistricting
---

I don't usually read the MIT Alumni Association web site.  I was
logging in today to check a friend's address and saw this [article on
Range Voting][article].  The Range Voting part is a little
interesting, but the best part for me is the
[anti-Gerrymandering][gerry] system.  

I don't think we need to overhaul our whole system.  It's just the
combination of gerrymandering, TV ads, overemphasis of parties, a
fixed-size house, and half a dozen other factors that make the current
system broken.  I advocate conservative, limited changes, tried on a
state-by-state basis to find unexpected difficulties.  Algorithmic
districting is a fine approach.  Massachusetts should try it.

I'm also curious about emergent districting approaches.  What if any
quarter-million people could declare themselves a district and select
a congressman?  I think you'd see much more direct allegiance to
representation of a constituency.  On the other hand, it would take
major party-like organization to coordinate a quarter-million-man
petition drive.
