title: Iraqi war effort shows unbelievably low corruption
description: Chinese propaganda makes up surprising numbers about US
---

[Xinhua][] and other sources less public about their biases have
published a number of articles this week with sentences like this:

> A quarterly audit by the special inspector general for Iraq
> reconstruction reveals the U.S. government has wasted tens of millions
> of dollars in a reconstruction effort that has cost American taxpayers
> more than 300 billion U.S. dollars and left the region near civil
> war.

That's astoundingly good news, and should not be ignored.  It's not
clear exactly how much this all adds up to, but we do see quotes for
about $86 million.  Let's call it a hundred million wasted, for a
wastage of one part per three thousand, one thirtieth of a percent.  I
would *love* to see a reliable way to run major development projects
in the third world with a waste and corruption rate of 0.03%.  I've
been awfully skeptical of the no-bid contracts handed out to
Halliburton and friends, but this makes me reconsider.  This is
unbelievable performance.
