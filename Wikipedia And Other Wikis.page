> ? "You also raise an interesting point about specialized wikis. Don't they represent a threat to the mass-market Wikipedia? In other words, as power Wikipedians divert their attention to the specialized wikis, this reduces the attention paid to the main site."

(I can't seem to find any link to add a comment, so I'm emailing you. To introduce myself, I've been editing Wikipedia for >3 years now, former administrator, and I've helped out on some of those specialized wikis and have watched others with interest.)

Specialized wikis *can* compete effectively with the main Wikipedias, but certain conditions have to be met. The advantages of doing all your work on a full Wikipedia shouldn't be underestimated: access to a large pool of competent editors, with very low transition costs - for example, it would be almost free for me to switch from working on, say, medieval history articles to working on Star Wars articles, because the methods, organization, tools like templates, and so on are mostly identical, because my account and reputation follow me there, because all my customizations and personal tools like custom Javascript or text editors will be equally applicable in the new area. This is not true if the medieval articles and Star Wars article are on entirely separate wikis. There are also network effects to consider - pretty much every article sooner or later needs to link out of its specialized area to more generalist articles. If the separate wikis have interwiki linking set up, it isn't all *that* much harder to link to articles on other wikis than it is to link to an article on the home wiki, but that's an esoteric and not popularly well known feature, and even at its best still adds friction to the work. - and a host of other benefits.

So basically the only way a specialist wiki can survive or thrive is if it is something Wikipedia refuses to carry. I was involved in the Star Wars area of en Wikipedia articles for a long time, and it did well, until it began to do _too_ well: editors from other areas saw the detail and profusion of articles in the SW area, and began moving to trim it down drastically and raise standards for the remaining articles. In other words, Wikipedia in a sense decided to stop carrying SW articles. This rejection prompted most of the hardcore SW editors to fork and begin building [Wookieepedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookieepedia) (a SW wiki hosted on Wikia) using the base of SW articles from Wikipedia. Now their resource is so good that SW editing is mostly dead on Wikipedia, with the exception of a few editors like Deckiller who focus on organizing and removing and improving what's left, and occasionally borrowing articles from Wookieepedia on the notable new or missing stuff.

Similarly, Wikibooks works because the Wikipedias refuse to carry that sort of thing, but people want to work on them anyway.

Wikimedia Commons *doesn't* work so well because you can still upload all the Free images to the Wikipedias quite easily - they haven't decided to force everyone to go away (and go to Commons to upload Free images) and so the Wikipedias are still a force to be reckoned with.

To summarize, if a Wikipedia allows something, the benefits of doing that something on that Wikipedia are so compelling that rival wikis can't really compete and wither. But if a Wikipedia cracks down on something, then they sometimes provide a seed for a new wiki to grow around and also a number of editors who want to work on that seed but are balked within the Wikipedia.
