> "You also raise an interesting point about specialized wikis. Don't they represent a threat to the mass-market Wikipedia? In other words, as power Wikipedians divert their attention to the specialized wikis, this reduces the attention paid to the main site."[^ref]

As Wikipedia takes a deletionist turn, moving content and contributors to specialized wikis certainly does seem like an attractive move. If Wikipedia doesn't appreciate you, take your efforts to a wiki which will! And if you start your own, you can be Administrator, Bureaucrat, Steward, and policy writer all rolled up in one. But this is a rosy dream for most. 

The fundamental fact is: Specialized wikis *can* compete effectively with the main Wikipedias, but only if the Wikipedias let them. It is, quite literally, Wikipedia's game to lose. Sometimes the other wiki can succeed, but it can only do so if certain conditions (within Wikipedia's power) are cleared.

# The advantages

The advantages of doing all your work on a full Wikipedia shouldn't be underestimated: access to a large pool of competent editors, with very low transition costs - for example, it would be almost free for me to switch from working on, say, medieval history articles to working on Star Wars articles, because the methods, organization, tools like templates, and so on are mostly identical, because my account and reputation follow me there, because all my customizations and personal tools like custom Javascript or text editors will be equally applicable in the new area. 

This is not true if the medieval articles and Star Wars article are on entirely separate wikis. There are also network effects to consider - pretty much every article sooner or later needs to link out of its specialized area to more generalist articles. If the separate wikis have interwiki linking set up, it isn't all *that* much harder to link to articles on other wikis than it is to link to an article on the home wiki, but that's an esoteric and not popularly well known feature, and even at its best still adds friction to the work. And there are many other subtler advantages hard to enumerate and appreciate until one works on a small & non-Wikipedia wiki.

# Necessary conditions

So basically the only way a specialist wiki can survive or thrive is if it is on a topic Wikipedia **refuses** to cover. 

## Examples

I was involved in the Star Wars area of the English Wikipedia for a long time, and it did well, until it began to do _too_ well: editors from other areas saw the detail and profusion of articles in the SW area, and began moving to trim them down drastically and raise standards for the surviving articles. In other words, Wikipedia in a very real & important sense just decided to stop carrying SW articles. 

This rejection prompted most of the hardcore SW editors to fork and begin building [Wookieepedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookieepedia) (a SW wiki hosted on Wikia) using the base of SW articles from Wikipedia. Now their resource is so good that SW editing is mostly dead on Wikipedia, with the exception of a few editors like Deckiller who focus on organizing and removing and improving what's left, and occasionally borrowing articles from Wookieepedia on the notable new or missing stuff.

Similarly, Wikibooks works because the Wikipedias refuse to carry that sort of thing, but people want to work on extensive textbooks anyway. (They aren't so good at finishing them, but still.)

(Wikimedia Commons *doesn't* work so well because you can still upload all the Free images to a Wikipedia quite easily - they haven't decided to force everyone to go away (and go to Commons to upload Free images)[^compromise] and so the Wikipedias are still a force to be reckoned with in the area of media.)

# Panspermia

To summarize, if a Wikipedia allows something, the benefits of doing that something on that Wikipedia are so compelling that rival wikis find it hard to compete and likely will wither. But if a Wikipedia cracks down on something, then they sometimes provide a seed for a new wiki to grow around and also a embryonic community of those editors who want to work on that topic but have been frustrated within the Wikipedia proper.

[^compromise]: In part this is because disabling 'local uploads' entails forbidding any use of 'fair use' pictures. When you consider the fact that the important photos for 99.9% of interesting global events for approximately the last century can only be used under the fair use doctrine, you begin to comprehend what a loss in article quality a disabling of local uploads would entail. Now, in theory one could keep local uploads enabled for fair use and force all the Free images over to Commons (probably via an aggressive campaign of deletion-tagging and automated uploads to Commons), but the Cabals fear that this would lead to indiscriminate and legally dangerous overuse of fair use. So there are few prospects that this stalemate will change any time soon on the English Wikipedia.
