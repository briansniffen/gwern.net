title: I love Indian food.
description: Why is my mouth on fire?

My folks gave us a bunch of pots and pans at our wedding.  One of
these was a "[Grille Pan][pan]," which neither Kat nor I had seen
before.  Now we've tried it.  What a great toy!  We grilled up an
eggplant, cauliflower, and a brick of paneer in some curry powder with
extra garlic and pepper, then a tomato and a pepper in thyme, and some
shiitake mushrooms.  I wish I'd taken pictures of the resulting
feast---it was enormous and wonderful.  The tomato was fine after
grilling on one side, but midway through the next it lost structural
integrity and turned into a sort of cacciatore.

Also, there's something about coriander and garlic and pepper---a
little bit of those, and my mood improves dramatically.  I certainly
*feel* smarter after eating those.  As Kat put it, "I love Indian
food.  I love everybody!  Why is my mouth on fire?"
