There's nothing that can't be improved by baking under a
yogurt/egg/cheese mixture.

Slice and fry three Italian eggplants while boiling 4 oz green lentils
in a few cups of vegetable stock.  Remove the eggplants from the oil,
then fry an onion for five minutes with a couple cloves of garlic.
Chop a large tomato, a pound of mushrooms, 2 tbs tomato paste, and a
can of chickpeas.  Pour the veggie stock and lentils over all that,
then add it to the onion-garlic oil.  Add marjoram, oregano, thyme,
rosemary to taste.  After ten minutes fried up, remove it from the
heat.  Alternate layers of eggplant and fried-mix in a big casserole.
Whisk together 3 eggs and 5/4 cups of yogurt---use no-fat at your own
risk.  Pour that over the layered stuff, then grate on a few ounces of
cheddar.  Bake for 45 minutes at 350.  Serves 4, not 6.  2050 kcal.

If you're not picky, skip the frying of the eggplant.  It does make a
slight textural difference, but with fresh eggplant you don't need the
extra stiffness.
