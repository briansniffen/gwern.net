This wiki is available at `darcs get --lazy http://www.gwern.net`

It works both with the [Hakyll](http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/) static site generator, used to generate <http://www.gwern.net>, and with [Gitit](http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net/), a featureful interactive wiki; both are written in [Haskell](!Wikipedia "Haskell (programming language)").

To use Hakyll, you `cd` into the repository and do `runhaskell hakyll.hs build`, and Hakyll will build a static HTML/CSS hierarchy inside `_site/`; you can then do something like `firefox _static/index.html`.

To use Gitit, you likewise `cd` but this time you run `gitit -f static/gwern.conf` and hopefully the configuration will pick up all elements and plugins; you then would do something like `firefox http://127.0.0.1:5001/`.

(Both Hakyll & Gitit setups assume you are running the latest version from HEAD. Nothing is guaranteed with older versions.)
