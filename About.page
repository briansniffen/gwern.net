## Source

The source pages works both with the
[Hakyll](http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/) static site generator,
which you're reading, and with [Gitit](http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net/), a featureful interactive wiki; both are written in [Haskell](!Wikipedia "Haskell (programming language)"). My preferred method of use is browse & edit locally using Gitit, and then distribute using Hakyll. This combines the speed, portability, and security of Hakyll with the user-friendliness of Gitit.

The source files are written in [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), and math is written in [LaTeX](!Wikipedia) compiled to [MathML](!Wikipedia). Comments are outsourced to [Disqus](!Wikipedia)^[Since I am not interested in writing a dynamic system to do it, and their anti-spam techniques are much better than mine.]. (These tools encourage a minimalist site; I believe that [minimalism](!Wikipedia) helps one focus on the content. Anything besides the content is [distraction and not design](http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/design.html). 'Attention!', as [Ikkyu](!Wikipedia) would say[^attention].) The revision history is controlled under [Darcs](!Wikipedia), but I periodically mirror it to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net).

[^attention]: Paraphrased from _Dialogues of the Zen Masters_ as quoted in pg 11 of the Editor's Introduction to _Three Pillars of Zen_:

     > "One day a man of the people said to Master Ikkyu: "Master, will you please write for me maxims of the highest wisdom?" Ikkyu immediately brushed out the word 'Attention'. "Is that all? Will you not write some more?"
     >
     > Ikkyu then brushed out twice: 'Attention. Attention.' The man remarked irritably that there wasn't much depth or subtlety to that. Then Ikkyu wrote the same word 3 times running: 'Attention. Attention. Attention.'
     >
     > Half-angered, the man demanded: 'What does "Attention" mean anyway?' And Ikkyu answered gently: 'Attention means attention.'"

- To use Hakyll, you `cd` into your repository and `runhaskell hakyll.hs build` (with `hakyll.hs` having whatever options you like). Hakyll will build a static HTML/CSS hierarchy inside `_site/`; you can then do something like `firefox _static/index`.
- To use Gitit, you likewise `cd` but run `gitit -f static/gwern.conf`. You then would do something like `firefox http://127.0.0.1:5001/`.

(Gwern's Hakyll & Gitit setups assume you are running HEAD. I'm using
the current versions from Cabal as of 16 January 2012.)
