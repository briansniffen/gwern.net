# Technical aspects

## Hosting

<http://www.gwern.net> exists as a set of static CSS, HTML, JS, & PDF files served by [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](!Wikipedia) ([NFSN homepage](http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net)).

NFSN is an old niche hosting company; its specific niche is controversial material and activist-friendly price structure - that is, its libertarian owners cast a jaundiced eye on [takedown request](!Wikipedia)s, and pricing is [pay-as-you-go](!Wikipedia). I like the former aspect, but it's the latter that sold me on NFSN.

Before I stumbled on NFSN^[Someone mentioned it to me in [#lesswrong](irc://freenode.net#lesswrong).], I was getting ready to pay $10-15 a month ($120 yearly) to a service like [Linode](!Wikipedia). I knew that Linode's offerings were overkill for my purposes since I didn't plan to run complex dynamic websites or even something like [Haskell.org](http://www.haskell.org) (which covers a number of services like mailing lists and [darcs](!Wikipedia) repository hosting), but I didn't know a good alternative. NFSN's price structure meant that I paid for actual usage rather than flat fees. I put in $32 to cover registering `gwern.net` until 2014, and then another $10 to cover bandwidth & storage price - and that has cost only a few cents so far. The $10 might well cover `gwern.net` for months to come, and that was what I had been willing to pay Linode for just a month! (Quite a [consumer surplus](!Wikipedia).)

## Source

The source of this wiki is available at `darcs get --lazy http://www.gwern.net`

It works both with the [Hakyll](http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/) static site generator, used to generate <http://www.gwern.net>, and with [Gitit](http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net/), a featureful interactive wiki; both are written in [Haskell](!Wikipedia "Haskell (programming language)"). My preferred method of use is browse & edit locally using Gitit, and then distribute using Hakyll. This combines the speed, portability, and security of Hakyll with the user-friendliness of Gitit. The source files are written in [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), math is written in simple [LaTeX](!Wikipedia) & compiled to [MathML](!Wikipedia) (which a JS script forces browsers to render), and the comments are outsourced to [Disqus](!Wikipedia)^[Since I am not interested in writing a dynamic system to do it, and their anti-spam techniques are much better than mine.]. (These tools encourage a minimalistic site; this is part of the attraction for me because I believe that [minimalism](!Wikipedia) helps one focus on the content - anything besides the content is a distraction. 'Attention!', as [Ikkyu](!Wikipedia) would say[^attention].)

To use Hakyll, you `cd` into the repository and do `runhaskell hakyll.hs build`, and Hakyll will build a static HTML/CSS hierarchy inside `_site/`; you can then do something like `firefox _static/index.html`.

To use Gitit, you likewise `cd` but this time you run `gitit -f static/gwern.conf` and hopefully the configuration will pick up all resources and plugins; you then would do something like `firefox http://127.0.0.1:5001/`.

(My Hakyll & Gitit setups assume you are running their latest version from HEAD. Nothing is guaranteed with older versions. Neither Hakyll nor Gitit was intended to be used with the same group of documents, so I have had to do a good deal of modification and extension.)

# The Content

The content here varies from philosophy to poetry to programming to prosaic FAQ; it is everything I felt worth writing for the past few years that didn't fit somewhere like Wikipedia. I never expected to write so much, but I discovered that once I had the hammer, nails were everywhere. I believe that someone who has been well-educated will think of something worth reading at least once a week; to a surprising extent, this has been true. (I have added roughly 130 documents to this repository over the past 3 years.) There are many benefits to keeping notes as they allow one to accumulate confirming and especially disconfirming evidence[^darwin], and even less-than-perfect drafts can be useful so you [Don't Repeat Yourself](!Wikipedia).

One of my personal interests is the idea of the [Long Now](!Wikipedia); what and how do you write a personal site with the long-term in mind? We live most of our lives in the future, and the actuarial tables give me until the 2070, excluding any benefits from [caloric restriction](!Wikipedia)/[intermittent fasting](!Wikipedia) or projects like [SENS](!Wikipedia "Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence"). It is a common-place in science fiction^[Such as Larry Niven's Known Space universe; consider the introduction to the chronologically last story in that setting, "Safe at Any Speed" (_Tales of Known Space_).] that extreme longevity will cause widespread risk aversion. But on the other hand, it could do the opposite: the longer you live, the more long-shots you can afford to invest in. Someone with a timespan of 70 years has reason to protect against black swans - but also time to look for them.^[fromm]

What sort of writing could you create if you resolved to work on it (be it ever so rarely) for the next 60 years? What could you do if you started *now*?[^jfk]

## Long Site

> "The Internet is self destructing paper. A place where anything written is soon destroyed by rapacious competition and the only preservation is to forever copy writing from sheet to sheet faster than they can burn.
>
> If it's worth writing, it's worth keeping. If it can be kept, it might be worth writing...If you store your writing on a third party site like [Blogger](!Wikipedia), [Livejournal](!Wikipedia) or even on your own site, but in the complex format used by blog/wiki software de jour you will _lose it forever_ as soon as hypersonic wings of Internet labor flows direct people's energies elsewhere. For most information published on the Internet, perhaps that is _not a moment too soon_, but how can the muse of originality soar when immolating transience brushes every feather?"^[[Julian Assange](!Wikipedia), 5 December 2006, ["Self destructing paper"](http://web.archive.org/web/20071020051936/http://iq.org/)]

Merely keeping the site running is a challenge in and of itself, and leads to recommendations similar to that for [Resilient Haskell Software](): 100% [FLOSS](!Wikipedia) software, open standards for data, human-readability, and staticness.

Preserving the content is another challenge. Keeping the content in a [DVCS](!Wikipedia) like [darcs](!Wikipedia) buys one protection against file corruption and makes it much easier for other people (or programs) to mirror the content; regular backups and burning the occasional copy onto DVD help as well. I have taken additional measures: [WebCitation](!Wikipedia) has archived most pages and almost all external links; the Internet Archive hopefully is also archiving pages & external links^[One can't be sure; the IA is fed by [Alexa](!Wikipedia), and Alexa doesn't guarantee pages will be [spidered](!Wikipedia "Web crawler") & thus preserved even if one goes through their request form.].

One could continue in this vein, devising ever more powerful & robust storage methods (perhaps combine the DVCS with [forward error recovery](!Wikipedia) through [PAR2](!Wikipedia), _a la_ [bup](http://lwn.net/Articles/380983/)), but what is one fill the storage with?

## Long Content

'Blog posts' might be the answer. But I have read blogs for many years now. Most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise. They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again. (But isn't that a terrible [ROI](!Wikipedia) for one's time?) On the other hand, the best blogs have always seemed to be building up to something: they are rough drafts - works in progress[^books]. So, I did not wish to write a blog. What, then?

> "It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson."^[Frank Herbert, _Dune_]

My current answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to tackle even with a month of free time; that knowing your site *will* survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful^[A sentiment long expressed; consider "A drop hollows out the stone" (Ovid, _Epistles_) or Thomas Carlyle's "The weakest living creature, by concentrating his powers on a single object, can accomplish something. The strongest, by dispensing his over many, may fail to accomplish anything. The drop, by continually falling, bores its passage through the hardest rock. The hasty torrent rushes over it with hideous uproar, and leaves no trace behind." (_The life of Friedrich Schiller_, 1825)]. I have a few examples of this, which I hope will show my meaning:

1. [N-back FAQ]():
     When I read in _Wired_ in 2008 that the obscure working memory exercise called dual n-back (DNB) had been found to increase IQ significantly, I was shocked. IQ is one of the most stubborn properties of one's mind, one of the most fragile[^fragile], the hardest to affect positively[^increase], but also one of the most valuable traits one could have^[There are a few that may be more valuable, like 'conscientiousness' (a rough synonym for self-discipline). But IQ is much better studied.]; if the technique panned out, it would be *huge*. Unfortunately, DNB requires a major time investment^[As in, 1 hour daily would not be too much.]; not a problem if it delivers, but it could be a huge loss. So, to do DNB or not?

     Questions of great import like this are worth studying carefully. The wheels of academia grind exceeding slow indeed, and only a fool expects unanimous answers from fields like psychology, so any attempt to answer the question 'is DNB worthwhile?' will also require years and cover a great breadth of material. This FAQ on DNB is my attempt to cover that great breadth over those years.
2. [_Neon Genesis Evangelion_ notes](otaku) and [essay draft](otaku-essay):
    I have been discussing & researching [Eva](!Wikipedia "Neon Genesis Evangelion") on and off since 2004. The task of interpreting Eva is very difficult; the source works themselves are a major time-sink^[25 episodes, 6 movies, >11 manga volumes - just to stick to the core works.], and there are thousands of primary, secondary, and tertiary works to consider - personal essays, interviews, reviews, etc. The net effect is that many Eva fans 'know' certain things about Eva, such as _[End of Evangelion](!Wikipedia)_ not being a grand 'screw you' statement by Hideaki Anno or that the TV series was censored, but they don't have *proof* of these things; and because each fan has been exposed to or remembers a different subset, they have irreconcilable [gestalt](!Wikipedia)s. And so on for specific pieces of critical interpretation. (Over the years I have criticized and argued a great variety of individual points in an equal variety of fora; half the value of the page for me is having a place to store things I've already said, so I can eventually turn them into something more systematic.)

    To compile key claims from all those works, to dig up old or forgotten references, to scroll through musty microfilms, buy issues of long-dead magazines - all this is enough work to shatter [the heart](!Wikipedia "Karoshi") of the stoutest Japanese salaryman. Which of course is why I began years ago and fully expect not to finish for years to come. (Finishing by 2020 seems like a reasonable [prediction](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/1951).)
3. [_Cloud Nine_](fiction/Cloud Nine):
    Many years ago I was reading through the academic papers of the economist [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia). I recommend his work highly; even if they are all false, they are highly imaginative and some of the finest speculative fiction I have ever read. Except of course they were non-fiction. One night I had a dream in which I saw in a flash a medieval city run in part on Hansonian grounds; one might call it a [steampunk](!Wikipedia) version of his [futarchy](!Wikipedia). A city must have another city as a rival, of course, and soon I had remembered the strange '90s idea of [assassination market](!Wikipedia)s, which was easily tweaked to work in a medieval setting. Finally, between them, was one of my favorite proposals, Buckminster Fuller's [cloud nine](!Wikipedia) megastructure.

    I wrote several drafts but each time wound up losing it; and I abandoned it until I could be sure my work wasn't going to be wasted. This fear leads straight into the next example:
4. [Book reading list]():
    Once, I didn't have to keep reading lists. I simply went to the school library shelf where I left off and grabbed the next book. But then I began reading harder books, and they would cite other books, and sometimes would even have horrifying lists of hundreds of other books I ought to read ('bibliographies'). I tried remembering the most important ones but quickly forgot. So I began keeping a book list on paper. I thought I would throw it away in a few months when I read them all, but somehow it kept growing and growing. I didn't trust computers to store it before^[As with _Cloud Nine_; I accidentally erased everything on a routine basis while messing around with Windows.], but now I do, and it lives on in digital form. With it, I can track how my interests evolved over time^[For example, I notice I am no longer deeply interested in the occult. Hopefully this is because I have grown mentally and recognize it as rubbish; I would be embarrassed if when I died it turned out my youthful self had a better grasp on the real world.], and what I was reading at the time. I sometimes wonder if I will read them all even by 2070.

What is next? So far the pages will persist through time, and they will gradually improve over time. But a truly Long Now approach would be to make them be improved *by* time - make them more valuable the more time passes. ([Stewart Brand](!Wikipedia) remarks in _[The Clock of the Long Now](!Wikipedia)_ that a group of monks carved thousands of scriptures into stone, hoping to preserve them for posterity - but posterity would value far more a carefully preserved collection of monk feces, which would tell us countless valuable things about important phenomenon like global warming.)

One idea I am exploring is adding long-term predictions to pages like the predictions I have been recording on [PredictionBook.com](http://predictionbook.com/users/gwern). Many[^fiction] pages explicitly or implicitly make predictions about the future. As time passes, predictions would be validated or falsified, providing objective feedback on the ideas.^[Merely thinking of predictions can be a good mental discipline; we should always be able to [cash out](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/) our beliefs in terms of the real world, or know why it cannot be cashed out. Unfortunately, humans being humans, we need to actually track our predictions - [*all* of them](!Wikipedia "Confirmation bias") - lest our predicting degenerate into [mere entertainment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hi/futuristic_predictions_as_consumable_goods/) like one sees in most political punditry.]

For example, the Evangelion essay's paradigm implies many things about the 2 yet-unmade movies in _[Rebuild of Evangelion](!Wikipedia)_^[Dozens of theories have been put forth, some quite detailed. I have been collecting & making predictions; and am up to 157. It will be very interesting to see how the movies turn out.]; [The Melancholy of Kyon]() is an extended prediction^[I already have 2 predictions registered about the thesis on PB.com: [1 reviewer will accept my theory by 2016](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/1833) and [the light novels will finish by 2015](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/1832).] of future major plot developments in _[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](!Wikipedia)_ series; [Haskell Summer of Code]() has suggestions about what makes good projects, which could be turned into predictions by applying them to predict success or failure when the next Summer of Code choices are announced. And so on.

[^fragile]: IQ is sometimes used as a proxy for health, like height, because it sometimes seems like any health problem will damage IQ. Didn't get much protein as a kid? Congratulations, your nerves will lack [myelination](!Wikipedia) and you will literally think slower. Missing some [iodine](!Wikipedia)? Say good bye to 10 points! Have tapeworms? There go some more points, and maybe an inch or two off your adult height, thanks to the worms stealing nutrients from you. Have a rough birth and suffer a spot of [hypoxia](!Wikipedia) before you began breathing on your own? Tough luck, old bean. It is very easy to *lower* IQ; you can do it with a baseball bat. It's the other way around that's nearly impossible.
[^increase]: And America has tried pretty hard over the past 60 years to affect IQ. The whole nature/nurture [black-white IQ debate](!Wikipedia "Race and intelligence") would be moot if there were some nutrient or educational system which could add even 10 points on average, because then we would use it on all the blacks. But it seems that I'm constantly reading about programs like [Headstart](!Wikipedia) which boost IQ for a little while... and do nothing in the long run.
[^fiction]: Obviously some don't. It's possible to make predictions for border cases like the book reading list ('I will read 20 books on the page this year' or 'I will add more books this year than I will read'), but what about the poems? My imagination fails there.
[^books]: Examples of such blogs:

     1. [Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia)'s contributions to [LessWrong](http://www.lesswrong.com) were the rough draft of a philosophy book
     2. John Robb's [Global Guerrillas](http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/) lead to his [_Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of Globalization_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471780790/)

[^attention]: Paraphrased from _Dialogues of the Zen Masters_ as quoted in pg 11 of the Editor's Introduction to _Three Pillars of Zen_:

     > "One day a man of the people said to Master Ikkyu: "Master, will you please write for me maxims of the highest wisdom?" Ikkyu immediately brushed out the word 'Attention'. "Is that all? Will you not write some more?"
     >
     > Ikkyu then brushed out twice: 'Attention. Attention.' The man remarked irritably that there wasn't much depth or subtlety to that. Then Ikkyu wrote the same word 3 times running: 'Attention. Attention. Attention.'
     >
     > Half-angered, the man demanded: 'What does "Attention" mean anyway?' And Ikkyu answered gently: 'Attention means attention.'"
[^darwin]: _[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin](!Wikipedia)_, 1902:

    > "I had, also, during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favourable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer."
[^jfk]: [John F. Kennedy](http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/JFK-Speeches/Address-At-The-University-Of-California-At-Berkeley.aspx), 1962:

    > 'I am reminded of the story of the great French Marshal Lyautey, who once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener objected that the tree was slow-growing and would not reach maturity for a hundred years.
    >
    > The Marshal replied, "In that case, there is no time to lose, plant it this afternoon."'
[^fromm]: Erich Fromm:

    > "If the individual lived five hundred or one thousand years, this clash (between his interests and those of society) might not exist or at least might be considerably reduced. He then might live and harvest with joy what he sowed in sorrow; the suffering of one historical period which will bear fruit in the next one could bear fruit for him too."
