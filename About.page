# Technical aspects

## Hosting

<http://www.gwern.net> exists as a set of static CSS, HTML, JS, & PDF files served by [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](!Wikipedia) ([NFSN homepage](http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net).

NFSN is an old niche hosting company; its specific niche is controversial material and activist-friendly price structure - that is, its libertarian owners cast a jaundiced eye on [takedown request](!Wikipedia)s, and pricing is [pay-as-you-go](!Wikipedia). I like the former aspect, but it's the latter that sold me on NFSN.

Before I stumbled on NFSN^[Someone mentioned it to me in [#lesswrong](irc://freenode.net#lesswrong).], I was getting ready to pay $10-15 a month ($120 yearly) to a service like [Linode](!Wikipedia). I knew that Linode's offerings were overkill for my purposes since I didn't plan to run complex dynamic websites or even something like [Haskell.org](http://www.haskell.org) (which covers a number of services like mailing lists and darcs hosting), but I didn't know a good alternative. NFSN's price structure meant that I paid for actual usage rather than flat fees. I put in $32 to cover registering `gwern.net` until 2014, and then another $10 to cover bandwidth & storage price - and that has cost only a few cents so far. The $10 might well cover `gwern.net` for years to come, and that was what I had been willing to pay Linode for just a month! (Quite a [consumer surplus](!Wikipedia).)

## Source

The source of this wiki is available at `darcs get --lazy http://www.gwern.net`

It works both with the [Hakyll](http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/) static site generator, used to generate <http://www.gwern.net>, and with [Gitit](http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net/), a featureful interactive wiki; both are written in [Haskell](!Wikipedia "Haskell (programming language)"). My preferred method of use is browse & edit locally using Gitit, and then distribute using Hakyll. This combines the speed, portability, and security of Hakyll with the user-friendliness of Gitit.

To use Hakyll, you `cd` into the repository and do `runhaskell hakyll.hs build`, and Hakyll will build a static HTML/CSS hierarchy inside `_site/`; you can then do something like `firefox _static/index.html`.

To use Gitit, you likewise `cd` but this time you run `gitit -f static/gwern.conf` and hopefully the configuration will pick up all resources and plugins; you then would do something like `firefox http://127.0.0.1:5001/`.

(My Hakyll & Gitit setups assume you are running their latest version from HEAD. Nothing is guaranteed with older versions. Neither Hakyll nor Gitit was intended to be used with the same group of documents, so I have had to do a good deal of modification and extension.)

# Content

The content here varies wildly from philosophy to poetry to programming to prosaic FAQ; it is everything I felt worth writing for the past few years that didn't fit somewhere else like Wikipedia. I never expected to write so much, but I discovered that once I had the hammer, I began seeing nails everywhere. I believe that someone who has been well-educated will think of something worth reading at least once a week; to a surprising extent, this has been true (I have added roughly 130 documents to this repository over the past 3 years).

One of my personal interests is the idea of the [Long Now](!Wikipedia); what and how do you write a personal site with the long-term in mind? After all, we live most of our lives in the future, and the actuarial tables give me until the 2070s; what sort of writing could you create if you resolved to work on it (be it ever so rarely) for the next 60 years?

## Long Site

Merely keeping the site running is a challenge in and of itself, and leads to recommendations similar to that for [Resilient Haskell Software](): [FLOSS](!Wikipedia), standards, human-readability, staticness.

Preserving the content is another challenge. Keeping the content in a [DVCS](!Wikipedia) like [darcs](!Wikipedia) buys one protection against file corruption and makes it much easier for other people (or programs) to mirror the content; regular backups and burning the occasional copy onto DVD help as well. I have taken additional measures: [WebCitation](!Wikipedia) has archived most pages and almost all external links, sometimes on multiple occasions; the Internet Archive hopefully is also archiving pages & external links^[One can't be sure; the IA is fed by [Alexa](!Wikipedia), and Alexa doesn't guarantee pages will be [spidered](!Wikipedia TODO) & preserved even if one goes through their request form.].

One could continue in this vein, devising ever more powerful & robust storage methods (perhaps combine the DVCS with [forward error recovery](!Wikipedia) through [PAR2](!Wikipedia), a la [bup](TODO)), but what is one fill the methods with?

## Long Content

My current answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to tackle even with a month of free time; that knowing your site *will* survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal to gather information for years. I have a few examples of this:

1. [N-back FAQ]():
     When I read in 2008 that the obscure working memory exercise called dual n-back (DNB) had been found to increase IQ significantly, I was shocked. IQ is one of the most stubborn properties of one's mind, one of the most fragile[^fragile], the hardest to affect positively[^increase], but also one of the most valuable traits one could have^[There are a few that may be more valuable, like 'conscientiousness'. But IQ is much better studied.]; if the technique panned out, it would be *huge*. Unfortunately, DNB requires a major time investment^[As in, 1 hour daily would not be too much.]; not a problem if it delivers, but it could be a huge loss. So, to do DNB or not?

     Questions of great import like this are worth studying carefully. The wheels of academia grind exceeding slow indeed, and only a fool expects unanimous answers from fields like psychology, so any attempt to answer the question 'is DNB worthwhile?' will also require years and cover a great breadth of material. This FAQ on DNB is my attempt to cover that great breadth over those years.
2. [_Evangelion_ notes](otaku) and [essay draft](otaku-essay):
    I have been discussing & researching Eva on and off since 2005 or so. The task of interpreting Eva is very difficult; the source works themselves are a major time-sink^[25 episodes, 6 movies, >11 manga volumes - just to stick to the core works.], and there are thousands of primary, secondary, and tertiary works to consider - personal essays, interviews, reviews, etc. The net effect is that many old Eva fans 'know' certain things about Eva, such as _End of Evangelion_ not being a grand 'screw you' statement by Hideaki Anno or that the TV series was censored, but they don't have proof of these things; and because each fan has been exposed to or remembers a different subset, they have irreconcilable [gestalt](!Wikipedia)s. Similarly for specific pieces of critical interpretation. (Over the years I have criticized and argued a great variety of individual points in an equal variety of fora; half the value of the page for me is having a place to store things I've already said, so I can eventually turn them into something more systematic.)

    To compile key claims from all those works, to dig up old or forgotten references, to scroll through musty microfilms, buy issues of long-dead magazines - all this is enough work to shatter [the heart](!Wikipedia "Karoshi") of the stoutest Japanese salaryman. Which of course is why I began years ago and fully expect not to finish for years to come. (Sometime after 2020 seems like a reasonable end date.)

3. [_Cloud Nine_](fiction/Cloud Nine):
    Many years ago I was reading through the academic papers of the economist [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia). I recommend his work highly; even if they are all false, they are highly imaginative and some of the finest speculative fiction I have ever read. Except of course they were non-fiction. One night I had a dream in which I saw in a flash a medieval city run in part on Hansonian grounds; one might call it a [steampunk](!Wikipedia) version of his [futarchy](TODO wikipedia? his PDF?). A city must have another city as a rival, of course, and soon I had remembered the strange '90s idea of [assassination market](!Wikipedia)s, which was easily tweaked to work in a medieval concept. Finally, between them, was one of my favorite proposals, Buckminster Fuller's [cloud nine](!Wikipedia) megastructure.

    I wrote several drafts but each time wound up losing it; and I abandoned it until I could be sure my work wasn't going to be wasted. This fear leads straight into the next example:
4. [Book reading list]():
    Once, I didn't have to keep reading lists. I simply went to the shelf where I left off and grabbed the next book. But then I began reading harder books, and they would cite other books, and sometimes would even have horrifying lists of hundreds of other books I ought to read ('bibliographies'). I tried remembering the most important ones but quickly forgot. So I began keeping a book list on paper. I thought I would throw it away in a few months when I read them all, but somehow it kept growing and growing. I didn't trust computers to store it before, but now I do, and it lives on in digital form. With it, I can track how my interests evolved over time^[For example, I notice I am no longer deeply interested in the occult. Hopefully this is because I have grown mentally and recognize it as rubbish; I would be embarrassed if when I died it turned out my youthful self had a better grasp on the real world.], and what I was reading at the time. I sometimes wonder if I will read them all even by 2070.

What is next? So far the pages will persist through time, and they will gradually improve over time. But a truly Long Now approach would be to make them be improved *by* time - make them more valuable the more time passes. (An example [Stewart Brand](!Wikipedia) gives in _[The Clock of the Long Now](!Wikipedia)_ is long scientific dataseries; even if only a few variables were crudely measured over the centuries, that series can be far more valuable than the most sophisticated data gathering done in a day. For example, the latter can say nothing about global warming.)

One idea I am exploring is adding long-term predictions to pages like the predictions I have been recording on [PredictionBook.com](http://predictionbook.com/users/gwern). Many[^fiction] pages explicitly or implicitly make predictions about the future. As time passes, predictions would be validated or falsified, providing objective feedback on the ideas. (Merely thinking of predictions can be a good mental discipline; we should always be able to cash out our beliefs in terms of the real world, or know why it cannot be cashed out.)

For example, the Evangelion essay's paradigm implies many things about the 2 yet-unmade movies in _[Rebuild of Evangelion](!Wikipedia)_; [The Melancholy of Kyon]() is an extended prediction^[I already have 2 predictions registered about the thesis on PB.com: TODO] of future major plot developments in _[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](!Wikipedia)_ series; [Haskell Summer of Code]() has suggestions about what makes good projects, which could be turned into predictions by applying them to predict success or failure when the next Summer of Code choices are announced. And so on.

I believe the public domain quasi-license reduces [FUD](!Wikipedia) and [dead-weight loss](!Wikipedia), encourages copying ([LOCKSS](!Wikipedia)), gives back (however little) to the [Free Software](!Wikipedia) and [Free Content](!Wikipedia) communities, and doesn't cost me anything^[Not as if I could *sell* anything on this wiki, and even if I could, I would want to polish it as much as possible, which would give me a fresh copyright if I so chose.].

[^fragile]: IQ is sometimes used as a proxy for health, like height, because it sometimes seems like any health problem will damage IQ. Didn't get much protein as a kid? Congratulations, your nerves will lack [myelination](!Wikipedia) and you will literally think slower. Missing some [iodine](!Wikipedia)? Say good bye to 10 points! Have tapeworms? There go some more points, and maybe an inch or two off your adult height, thanks to the worms stealing nutrients from you. Have a rough birth and suffer a spot of [hypoxia](!Wikipedia) before you began breathing on your own? Tough luck, old bean. It is very easy to *lower* IQ; you can do it with a baseball bat. It's the other way around that's nearly impossible.
[^increase]: And America has tried pretty hard over the past 60 years to affect IQ. The whole nature/nurture black-white IQ debate TODO link would be moot if there were some nutrient or educational system which could add even 10 points on average, because then we would use it on all the blacks. But it seems that I'm constantly reading about programs like [Headstart](!Wikipedia) which boost IQ for a little while... and do nothing in the long run.
[^fiction]: Obviously some don't. It's possible to make predictions for border cases like the book reading list ('I will read 20 books on the page this year' or 'I will add more books this year than I will read'), but what about the poems? My imagination fails there.
