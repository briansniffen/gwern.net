title: PayPal to deploy SecurID
description: Gavin Lowe's attack lives on
---

[Apparently](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070112-8608.html),
[PayPal](http://paypal.com) is about to deploy a SecurID-like system.
SecurID is a two-factor authentication scheme: a little widget
generates a new code every minute or so.  When you log in, you
concatenate your password and the magic code.  These are sent to the
machine on the other side, which can compare the code against a known
sample.

Notice that no challenge-response is involved, and at no point does
the server authenticate to you.  Further, no shared secret is
established for use as a session authenticator.  In practical terms,
that means that there must be attacks against this.  Here's one:
perform your normal phishing scheme.  At exactly the moment you
receive the secret code, log in to the user's account and transfer
money away from him.

The real problem here is not just users giving away their passwords:
it's weak authentication in general.
