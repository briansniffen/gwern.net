title: Apple's real iPod and iTMS lock-in
description: Who needs DRM when we have patents?
---

Apple's god-king recently [announced][] that he'd be happy to sell
music without DRM.  I even sort-of believe him.  That is, I believe
he's not delighted to be a sell-out, and would rather do business in a
Whole Earth-friendly way than otherwise... as long as both are
massively profitable.

Ed Felten at Princeton followed up with his own [note][] on the
furor.  I think he misses a point, though.  Jobs wrote:

But he's trying to slip something by you.  Even if Apple strips out
DRM and ceases to hold a monopoly on players-of-FairPlay-music,
they'll still have the only convenient HW player for AAC.  AAC may be
an open standard, but outside of Apple and some weird Archos gear, you
don't see it at the BestBuy.
