koyoi bakari ya
makura sadamenu; tanomekoshi
yume no tadachi wa

If only for this one night,
let us share a pillow.
Till now I relied
on the straight path of my dreams
as reality.
pg203, Carter

kesa mo izuru
nono no yamabito; chihayaburu

This morning again they emerge -
the mountain folk of Ono.
From mighty Kamo,
the Miare Procession
going down the road.
pg202, Carter

kore ya ikoma no
mine nara; yuki to mietaru

So, this is what
I have heard about - the peak
of Ikoma Mountain.
What had looked to me like snow -
it was a grove of blossoms!
pg202, Carter

hosanu magaki no
fuyu no shirigiku; hatsushigure
haruru hikage mo

Near the bamboo fence,
white winter chrysanthemums.
Season's first showers
clear - though by then the sunshine
has faded away.
pg202, Carter


waga mi yo ni
furu to mo nashi no
nagame shite
iku harukaze ni

While I gazed out,
barely conscious that I too
was growing old,
how many times have blossoms
scattered on the spring wind?
pg201-202, Carter

maneku tote
kusa no tamoto no
kai mo araji
towarenu  sato no

Wave though they may,
those sleeve-like plumes of grass
can do no good -
at a house no one visits,
by an old bamboo fence.
pg201, Carter

yo to tomo ni
fukiage no hama no
shiokaze ni
nabiku masago no

Age after age
the sea breeze on the beach
at Windblown Strand
has dashed sand against the shore
to be shattered - like my heart.
pg 201, Carter

kino kyo
kumo no hatate ni
nagamu tote
mi mo senu hito no

Yesterday, today,
I have spent gazing afar
at banners of cloud;
but how can one I've never met
know I was thinking of her?
pg201, Carter

shirotae no
sode no wakare ni
tsuyu ochite
mi ni shimu iro no
akikaze zo fuku
When we parted,
dewdrops fell down on my sleeves
of pure white hemp -
your coldness harsh as the hue
of the piercing autumn wind.
pg199, Carter

kaerusa no
mono to ya hito no
nagamuran
matsu yo nagara no
ariake no tsuki
After his tryst,
he too may be looking up
on his way back home -
while for me a night of waiting
ends with the dawn moon.
pg198-199, Carter

tabibito no
sode fukikaesu
akikaze ni
yube sabishiki

With the autumn wind
turning back the flowing sleeves
of a traveler,
how lonely in evening light
is the bridge above the gorge!
pg198, Carter

ozora wa
mume no nioi ni
kasumitsutsu
kumori mo hatenu
haru no yo no tsuki
Through the wide heavens
the scent of plum blossoms moves
like a spreading haze;
but still not clouded over
is the moon of this spring night.
pg196, Carter

mume no hana
nioi o utsusu
sode no ue ni
noki moru tsuki no
kage zo arasou
Blossoms of plum
perfume my sleeves with their scent,
vying there for space
with shafts of sparkling moonlight
spilling down through the eaves.
pg196-196, Carter

shimo mayou
sora ni shioreshi
karigane no
kaeru tsubasa ni
harusame zo furu
Weary wild geese who came
through skies once chilled by frost
now head back north -
and on their departing wings
fall the soft rains of spring.
pg197, Carter

kasumi ka wa
hana uguisu ni
tojiarete
haru ni komoteru
yado no akebono
Only the haze?
No, by blossoms and warblers
it is held fast -
as I too am bound by spring
in my house, at break of day.
pg195, Carter

hitotose o
nagametsukuseru
asatoide ni
usuyuki koru
sabishisa no hate
After a full year
of gazing out, one morning
I open my door -
to a thin snowfall, frozen -
the far edge of loneliness.
pg195, Carter

yasurai ni
idenishi mama no
tsuki no kage
waga namida nomi
sode ni matedomo
He seemed reluctant
to take his leave of me then,
in the same moonlight
that shines in tears on these sleeves,
still awaiting his return.
pg196, Carter


shinobe to ya
shiranu mukashi no
aki o hete
onaji katami ni
nokoru tsukikage
"Think of the past!" -
so the moonlight seems to say,
itself a remnant
of autumns long since gone,
that I could never know.
Carter, pg 194

maboroshi yo
yume to mo iwaji
yo no naka wa
kakute kikimiru
hakanasa zo kore
An apparition!
Don't even call it a dream.
In this world of ours,
what we hear about, what see
as transience - this is it#!
Carter, pg 195


    toshi furedo
    kokoro no haru wa
    yoso nagara
    nagamenarenuru
    akebono no sora
    Another year gone by
    And still no spring warms my heart,
    It's nothing to me
    But now I am accustomed
    To stare at the sky at dawn.
    pg 663 of Keene 1999 Keene, Donald (1999), Seeds in the Heart: Japanese Literature from Earliest Times to the Late Sixteenth Century, Columbia University Press, ISBN 0-231-11441-9

        Kimi ga yo ni

    In our Lord's gracious reign,
    Will I still have cause to cry aloud
    As cries the crane
    That now stalks desolate in reedy marshes
    Far from its former cloudland of spring haze?
    pg 97 of Brower 1978 Brower, Robert H. (1978), Translation of Fujiwara Teika's Hundred-Poem Sequence of the Shoji Era, 1200, Sophia University, ASIN B0006E39K8

    Ashitazu no

    Now that the year
    Has closed in which it lost its way
    Upon the cloudland path,
    Must the crane still be kept apart
    Even from the haze of a new spring?
    pg 46 of Brower 1972

     Michinobe no
    Nohara no yanagi

    Under the willows
    In the field by the roadside
    The young sprouts burgeon
    In competition as to which,
    Alas, has most to bewail.
    pg 100, Keene 1989; from a palace competition, 13th day, 2nd month, 1220

    Tell it in the capital:
    That like the steadfast pine trees
    On Takasago's sands,
    At Onoe, the cherries on the hills
    yet wait in the fullness of their bloom.
    pg 47 of Brower 1978

my floating bridge of dreams

nagaku tomade wa
oshimareji mi o
If with your reign
I am not to meet, for what should
My jewelled belt of life
Stretch on and on,
Without a care?

chigiri arite

kakete tanoman
It must be fate-
On this day by the sacred river's
Barken garlands,
'For as long as they should
Hang there,' is my plea.

    Konu hito o
    Matsuho no ura no
    Yunagi ni
    Yaku ya moshio no
    Mi mo kogare tsutsu
    Like the salt sea-weed,
    Burning in the evening calm.
    On Matsuo's shore,
    All my being is aflame,
    Awaiting her who does not come.
    こぬ人を
    まつほの浦の
    夕なぎに
    焼くやもしほの
    身もこがれつつ
    Konu hito o
    Matsuho no ura no
    Yunagi ni
    Yaku ya moshio no
    Mi mo kogare tsutsu.
    Like the salt sea-weed,
    Burning in the evening calm.
    On Matsuo's shore,
    All my being is aflame,
    Awaiting her who does not come.
    pg 81 of Brower 1978?
    On Matsuo Beach
    I wait in the pines at dusk
    for one who won't come -
    and like the blazing salt mounds,
    I too am consumed by fire.

# Go-toba's 100 poems competition

        駒とめて
    袖うちはらふ
    かげもなし
    佐野のわたりの
    雪の夕暮
    Koma tomete
    Sode uchiharau
    Kage mo nashi
    Sano no watari no
    Yuki no yūgere.
    There is no shelter
    where I can rest my weary horse,
    and brush my laden sleeves:
    the Sano Ford and its fields
    spread over with twilight in the snow.
    pg 81 of Brower 1978

    koma tomete
    sode uchiharau
    kage mo nashi
    Sano no watari no
    yuki no yugure
    I stop my horse
    And brush off my sleeves;
    No shelter here
    This evening of snow
    At the crossing of Sano

# Go-toba's Saisho Shitteno screens

    aki to dani
    fukiaenu kaze ni
    iro kawaru
    Ikuta no mori no
    tsuyu no shitagusa
    Its color has changed
    Though the winds of autumn
    Have yet to blow;
    The dew-laden undergrowth
    Of the Wood of Ikuta
    pg 99? Keene, _Travelers of 100 Ages)

# Shūi Gusō

    You've forgotten, you say?
    Alright, then, I too will forget
    that when we parted,
    I said I would convince myself
    it was nothing but a dream.
