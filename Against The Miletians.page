# Against the Miletians and the One True Element

One of my problems with the Miletians^[And with Thales/Anaximenes in particular.] is that the discussions of elements seem either vacuous or ill-defined.

## Notation

For lack of diagrams, I represent the graphs of elemental transformation textually. A directed graph has nodes. A node is bi- or uni-directional. Any element capitalized is to be considered a True Element in that graph; I don't insist on monism, so some graphs will have multiple True Elements. That is, Thales's system gives us a graph that looks like this:

> earth ↔ Water, air ↔ Water, fire ↔ Water, Water ↔ Water

## Elemental trapdoors

To see what I mean, consider this: either all the other elements can turn into the True Element, or not.

Suppose the latter possibility – there are one-way transformations. Then the graph might look like

> Water ↔ Water, Water ↔ air, Water ↔ fire, Water → earth

(I use earth here, but the argument works for any element.)

If we assume this, it is saying that 'once earth comes into existence, it will never turn back into water, air, or fire'. Given this, we should expect to observe a cosmos composed of earth, or at least a cosmos suffering irreversible diminution in air, fire, and water. We do not observe such a cosmos. Thus we can reject the possibility of irreversible transformation on empirical grounds. (Not to mention simplicity and symmetry.)

## Free trade

Let us assume the other hypothesis: all elements can be converted to the original element, and from the original into any other.

But given that premise, why do we prefer any graph to any other? They *look* identical! That is,

> earth ↔ Water, fire ↔ Water, air ↔ Water

is observationally identical to

> Air ↔ water, fire ↔ water, earth ↔ water

or

> Fire ↔ earth, air ↔ earth, water ↔ earth

(And so on.) All three graphs predict we'd observe a mix of air/water/fire/earth, and no obvious trends. Even if we could rule out for certain a graph like

> Air ↔ water, Air ↔ earth, Air ↔ fire

we still have no reason to claim that the first node with multiple links is the True Element! *Why not* have a cosmogony in which fire gives birth to air, which is convertible to all the other elements and from thence all things? It is no stranger or more convoluted than the chain of being we see in the _Theogony_, for example.

## Wrong or Meaningless

Denoting any node as the True Element and the other nodes as just elements doesn't add anything to our graph. If you claim a system of elemental substances, then you cannot claim to have a True Element and also allow elements to turn into each other - because then your system either is obviously wrong as it conflicts with observed reality, or, your suggestion is meaningless. At the least, reconciling elemental elements with elemental change is harder than it looks.
