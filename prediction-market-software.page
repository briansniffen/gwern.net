prediction markets idea:

Prediction market software ideas

basic idea: take a RSS feed from a major prediction market (if RSS
feeds don't exist, perhaps screenscraping with Tagsoup); ask the user
for predicted probability in 10% increments for a bunch of markets.
Every time the program is run, it asks for fresh assessments on
markets that have changed the most (perhaps the top 10).

When markets close, it pops up a message that summarizes your
performance in it. Did you predict something opposite how it closed?
(ie. if you rated it a 90% success, and it actually failed, that's
bad; but it's also a little bad if you rated it 51%). Perhaps it'd be
more valuable to tell you whether you anticipated the market movements
or not - since one would expect the last assessment to be extremely
high or low (by November 1, it was pretty obvious Obama was going to
win, for example, so one should only get a little credit for assessing
Obama high).
It also keeps track of your calibration - did the markets you assess
at 60% happen 60% of the time? etc.

possible idea: generate a random number between 0-100 and display it
prominently somewhere in the UI. the point is to try to trigger
anchoring bias http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring - in this case
the really objectionable form of anchoring where demonstrably
irrelevant or randomly generated numbers still affect you

another idea: time limits. Perhaps it could alternate - on even ratings, one has 5 seconds for a snap judgment; but on odd ratings one can take as long as one likes.
