[Adrafinil](!Wikipedia "Adrafinil") was a wakefulness drug developed back in the late 1970s or so. It worked reasonably well, and interestingly enough, in a different way from most stimulants.[^amph] Inside the body, adrafinil is metabolized by the liver into [modafinil](!Wikipedia "Modafinil"). So using adrafinil is inferior to using a straight dose of modafinil both because it stresses the liver and because reportedly you need about 3 times more adrafinil to be metabolized into an equivalent dose of modafinil. Its chief advantages are that all patents on it expired long ago, and it's very rarely proscribed - so it is relatively cheap & easy to get.

Modafinil is better, but the problem is that a number of forms are patented, and in addition, it's a proscribed drug in the US & Canada[^proscribed]. So you can either try to convince a doctor to give you a prescription or deal with dubious online pharmacies or suppliers in countries where modafinil is available over-the-counter. The former way is annoying and you pay full price, and the latter way is unreliable and *still* expensive - you may be buying at a lower price, but the risks of seizure at the border, shipping, possibly paying for laboratory assays etc. can more than make up for that.

Modafinil costs about 2$ a day for a prescription[^angry]; non-prescription sources are too unpredictable to say.[^prices]

# Side effects

Modafinil has a few side-effects. (I omit adrafinil's possible liver damage since it doesn't apply to modafinil.)

- Bad-smelling urine is very commonly reported^[See, eg. <http://ask.metafilter.com/47324/How-well-does-Modafinil-work#720855>, <http://ask.metafilter.com/47324/How-well-does-Modafinil-work#1072382>]. Apparently is related to sulfur breakdown products^[["Urine smells of suplhur"](!Wikipedia "Talk:Modafinil#Urine_smell_of_sulphur.3F")].
- Over-stimulation?
- and that's about it.

Don't believe me? Then try this quote from the abstract of a journal review of modafinil:

> "Furthermore, modafinil appears to be well-tolerated, with a low rate of adverse events and a low liability to abuse."[^review]

# Benefits

Modafinil has a couple different but closely related benefits. You can sum them up as pretty much it cuts your sleep need by about 2/3s, or it allows you to go without sleep for a day with no penalty. (If you aren't sleep-deprived, it seems to just increase your alertness and energy levels.)

Also, it may make you smarter - even if you're healthy:

> "In addition, modafinil (at well-tolerated doses) improves function in several cognitive domains, including working memory and episodic memory, and other processes dependent on prefrontal cortex and cognitive control. These effects are observed in rodents, healthy adults, and across several psychiatric disorders."[^review]

# Analysis

So what's the cost benefit analysis here? We need to take into account the financial expense of modafinil, the biological side-effects, and the benefit of less sleep.

As in [Melatonin](), we'll assume the value of our time is measured at minimum wage. We'll also assume melatonin costs $3 a day (I've been assured it's really $2, but we'll tack on 50% to be conservative). Finally, we'll assume the average sleep savings per day is 4 hours - roughly half one's sleep; this seems reasonable since sometimes people will use modafinil to skip that day's sleep and sometimes they'll sleep normally and will take it for greater performance while they are awake.

So, our very first calculation goes (minimum-wage * hours-saved), or ($6.55 * 4), or 26.2 dollars. 26.2 > 3, so off-hand modafinil seems worthwhile - the return is 873.3%

But what of the other costs? There's the stinky pee, for example. I don't think this is even worth including, but let's assign it 5 cents (how long are you going to be in the bathroom anyway?). Then there are the unknown health effects. Sure, the skeptic says, the studies have turned up very few things, but what about the long-term effects?

Well, alright. We'll add it in. Let's consider the worst-case: modafinil is fatal. One human life is usually valued at around 10 million dollars. I personally can expect another 50 years of life. So per day, the expense of a fatal-modafinil habit (we assume the death could any day) would be 10,000,000 / (50 * 365.25), or $548. Ouch. That is noticeably larger than the 26.2 dollars we expected to gain. But this is the worst case; there's no way modafinil is actually 100% lethal.

So the expected value of modafinil is approximately 21 times less than it needs to be. Or, to put it another way, if modafinil had a less than 1-in-21 chance of killing you, it could be worth while. Do you think modafinil has a less than 1/21 kill rate? I do.

# Suppliers & Prices
Fine, but how are we going to get any modafinil?

<http://ask.metafilter.com/47324/How-well-does-Modafinil-work#1052514>:

> "I had a bad experience ordering from a company called rx2world.com, so I would advise against getting your modafinil from them. They owe me 70 dollars!...
I now get mine from a place in the UK and have had no problems with them. <www.buymodafinil.co.uk> I think they are cheaper because they use a generic version of Provigil, Modalert and I can say that it works for me."

<http://www.drugbuyers.com/freeboard/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Number/555209/fpart/3>:

> "Buymodafinil.co.uk has not been delivering. Recommend staying away. Visapharmacy.com is apparently having problems. Previous experience ok though. IndianMeds4u.com sends partial orders. Recommend staying away. Airsealed is quick and reliable. Bulk powder good quality."

(Airsealed is apparently no longer offering bulk powder.)

Is the Modalert brand often fake? <http://www.topix.net/forum/health/narcolepsy/T5G91I20L8QQNE68F> only just one of the multiple claims to that effect I found. But it's also cheaper... Perhaps the issue is that SunPharm isn't very good? See <http://www.drugbuyers.com/freeboard/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=703659#Post703659>

# Usage

> "Modafinil can be reliably determined in plasma and urine (Schwertner and Kong, 2005; Tseng et al, 2005), and is readily absorbed (40–65%, as measured by urinary recovery) after single (Wong et al, 1999a) or multiple oral doses (Wong et al, 1999b), reaching peak plasma concentrations 2–4 h after administration (Wong et al, 1999a). The presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract can slow the rate but does not affect the total extent of absorption. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved between 2 and 4 days with repeated dosing. It is highly lipophilic, and approximately 60% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Major pharmacokinetic parameters are independent of doses in the range of 200–600 mg/day (Robertson and Hellriegel, 2003). The major circulating metabolites modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone do not appear to exert any significant activity in the brain or periphery (Robertson and Hellriegel, 2003). The elimination half-life is approximately 12–15 h (Wong et al, 1999a), and single daily dosing is adequate and common in clinical practice."^[Minzenberg again.]

[^amph]: See Minzenberg _et al_:

    > "It is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a schedule IV agent to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. It has been popularly categorized as a psychostimulant due to its wake-promoting properties. However, it has shown a number of effects on physiology and behavior in both animal models and in humans, which suggest a divergent mechanism of action compared to amphetamine (described in detail below). This includes a lower liability to abuse, and a lower risk of adverse effects on organ systems such as the cardiovascular system."
