title: By grace alone through faith we are justified
description: One exposition of the core Lutheran doctrine
---

The title is one of the core beliefs of the Lutheran church.  It's
often... well, alright: it's rarely heard at all.  But by those who do
hear it, it's often misunderstood to mean this:

> As a sort of special present, we're offered a deal: in exchange for
> belief in Jesus' divinity and agreement to serve His interests,
> He'll intercede with His father to prevent the punishment we'd
> otherwise receive.

This is a cosmic blackmail scheme.  I can't imagine anyone happily
follows such a God---with this understanding, one must either depart
the Church in pride, or stew uncomfortably on it.  But there are
alternate explanations.  For example, here's one based on early
chapters of Marcus Borg's *Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time*:

> Humans were built as imperfect creatures.  Part of that imperfection
> is a tendency to do things that make us and those around us
> unhappy.  Part of that imperfection is a bad trade-off of risk
> vs. long term reward.  We can call the behaviors based on these
> imperfections **sin**.

With this understanding of sin, we can see why the designer of mankind
might want to issue a patch.  We might prefer, in the interests of
ourselves and our ancestors, that he'd issued it further in the past.
Why was this done only after thousands of years of human history?  I'm
not sure, and that's a subject for another post.  For now, consider
that it might be ineffable and it might be a requirement for human
society to evolve to a certain point from its origins.  That's a
terrible sort of answer, and I look forward to expanding on it later.

We can call the patch **justification**.  We are irregular and broken:
we commit unjust acts.  It would be nice to repair humanity and human
society.  Sometimes this justification is thought of as being saved
from an external source of sin.  Then we call it **salvation**.  I'm
going to stick with the term justification, though, to emphasize that
this is about internal changes to individuals and communities being
made just.

> We are in bondage to sin and cannot free ourselves.

That is, we cannot repair the brokenness within ourselves.  We can
teach our children to be better than we are, but not better enough to
fix this.  We can construct Utopian artificial societies... but they
turn into horrors.  We need help from outside the system to repair the
system.  That help is called **grace**.  But maybe we can help!  Maybe
there's something we can do to accept the helpful patch and assist in
its application!  Well, for more reasons that I won't go into here, we
can't.  This is an open debate within the Christian community.  The
old Lutheran dogma says grace *alone*, but Catholics and others will
tell you that good works are required.  What's a good work?  Charity,
benevolence, just rule and obedient service... and belief.  Belief as
a requirement for salvation is part of the technical term "good work."
When Lutherans write "grace alone," we mean that you don't have to
hold to any particular dogma to receive justification.  There is no
test to pass---and therefore no test to study for.  Nothing humanity
can do, individually or collectively, can help it receive
justification.

That could be the end of the message.  We could say "By grace alone we
are justified."  Sometimes we do: a different Lutheran creed says
simply, "Grace alone."  The creed I used in the title says a bit more,
though.  It tells us what the patch looks like: what change will be
made to humans and to humanity in order to justify us.

Faith is not belief or adherence to doctrine.  Faith is participation
in a relationship with God.  It's not a demanded creed to which we
must subscribe in order to receive the patch of justification.  It
*is* the patch of justification: a change in the relationship between
God and Man, initiated and sustained by God's unilateral action.  That
is, the process of justification operates **through** faith, not as a
magic trick performed after faith.

> By grace alone through faith we are justified.

Now we can understand this as a statement densely packed with
technical terms:

 * **Grace**: action by God above and beyond what he committed to in
   prior covenants with Man.

   * **Alone**: unilateral action.  When we say "by grace alone," we mean
     that only grace accounts for the phenomenon described.

   * **By**: a description of initiatory mechanism: the reason why
     something comes to be.

 * **Faith**: participation in a relationship with God.

   * **Through**: a description of operating mechanism: the means by
     which something comes to be.  When we say "through
     faith," we mean that the described phenomenon operates by means of
     faith.

   * **We**:  Mankind, collectively, individually, and as the
     communities intermediate between the individual and the species.

 * **Justified**: repaired, such that we are no longer troubled by sin.

   * **Are**:  present indicative.  When we say we "are justified," we
     mean that the process of justification is continuous and ongoing.
     We have not *been justified* in a way that operated and then
     ceased, completed.  We *are justified* each day anew by the
     continued operation of a faith that exists by continued operation
     of grace.

   * **Sin**: flaws in the operation of Man (see "We" above).
