The above is the title of a book recently published by the publishing
company of the Presbyterian Church USA.  It's [been covered
by][griffin] the Wall Street Journal's online publication.
Some [direct coverage][] is also available.

As I would ask of any member of a very large organization, I watch the
mainstream Protestant churches.  I won't take responsibility for the
born-agains, and the Catholics and the Orthodox don't need to be
watched so closely.  The mainstream Protestant churches sometimes do
weird things, and I feel responsible for noticing and evaluating them.

The publication of this tract is a mistake.  This is a sign of a great
emptiness, a confusion of truth with volume and investigation with
speculation.
