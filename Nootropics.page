A record of [nootropics](!Wikipedia)^[No entheogens or hallucinogens; those are not the kind of psychoactives that interest me. I also try to stay on the right side of the law, although this can be difficult and limits my options.] I have tried, with thoughts about which ones worked and did not work for me.

Your mileage *will* vary. There are so many parameters and interactions in the brain that any of them could be the bottleneck or responsible pathway, but ultimately they all cash out in a very few subjective assessments like 'energetic' or 'motivated', with even apparently precise descriptions like 'working memory' or 'verbal fluency' not telling you much about what the nootropic *actually* did. It's tempting to list the nootropics that worked for *you* and tell everyone to go use them, but that is merely [generalizing from one example](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) (and the more nootropics - or meditation styles, or self-help books, or 'getting things done' systems - you try, the stronger the temptation is to [evangelize](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/)). The best you can do is read all the testimonials and studies and use that to prioritize your list of nootropics to try. You don't know in advance which ones will pay off and which will be wasted. You *can't* know in advance.

I do recommend a few things, like [modafinil](Modafinil) or [melatonin](Melatonin), to many people. Some of those people are helped; some have told me that they tried and the suggestion did little or nothing. I view nootropics as akin to a biological lottery; one good discovery pays for all. From my own perspective, melatonin & piracetam have paid for themselves and all the entries below; I forge on in the hopes of further striking gold in my unique biology. Your mileage will vary. All you have to do, all you can do is to [just try it](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5a5/no_seriously_just_try_it/).

# Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

No effects, alone or mixed with choline+piracetam. This is pretty much as expected from reports about [ALCAR](!Wikipedia), but I had still been hoping for energy boosts or something. (Bought from Smart Powders.)

# Adrafinil

The [adrafinil](!Wikipedia)/Olmifon (bought simultaneously with the [hydergine](#hydergine) from Anti-Aging Systems, now [Antiaging Central](http://antiagingcentral.com/store/catalog/index.php?cPath=32)) was a disappointment. Almost as expensive as actual modafinil, with the risk of liver problems, but did nothing whatsoever that I noticed. It is supposed to be subtler than modafinil, but that's a little ridiculous.

# Aniracetam

Very expensive; I noticed minimal improvements when combined with sulbutiamine & piracetam+choline. Definitely not worthwhile for me.

# Beta-phenylethylamine (PEA)

Based on this [_H+_](http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/neuro/nutraceutical-brain-boosting-free-schwag) article/advertisement, I gave a PEA supplement a try. Noticed nothing. Critical commentators pointed out that PEA was notoriously degraded by the digestive system, though Neurvana's 'pro' supplement claimed to avoid that. I guess it doesn't. No need to try it out again, anyway.

# Caffeine

I ordered 400g of 'anhydrous [caffeine](!Wikipedia)' from [Smart Powders](http://www.smartpowders.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=sp035). Apparently my [oolong tea](!Wikipedia) doesn't contain very much caffeine, so adding half a gram wakes me up a bit. Surprisingly for something with 'anhydrous' in its name, it doesn't seem to dissolve very well.

Caffeine is of course the most famous stimulant around. But consuming 0.5g or more a day, I have discovered the downside: it is addictive and has a nasty withdrawal. (Headaches, decreased motivation, apathy, and generalized unhappiness.) This is in considerable contrast to the other substances I like, such as piracetam or fish oil. I knew about withdrawal of course, but it was not so bad when I was drinking only tea. And the side-effects like jitteriness are worse on caffeine without tea; I chalk this up to the lack of [theanine](#theanine). (My later experiences with theanine seems to confirm this.)

I'm going continue to use the caffeine. It's not so bad in conjunction with tea, is very cheap, and I'm already addicted, so why not? I ultimately mixed it in with the 3kg of piracetam and included it in that batch of pills. (I mixed it very thoroughly, one ingredient at a time, so I'm not very worried about 'hot spots'. But if you are, one clever way to get accurate caffeine measurements is to [measure out a large quantity & dissolve it](http://diysupplements.com/2011/02/add-caffeine-to-everything/) since it's easier to measure water than powder, and dissolving guarantees even distribution. This trick is applicable to anything else that dissolves nicely.)

# Choline

Does little alone, but absolutely necessary in conjunction with [piracetam](#piracetam). In the future, I might try Alpha-GPC instead of the regular cholines; that supposedly has better bio-availability. (Bought from Smart Powders.)

# Coconut oil

[Coconut oil](!Wikipedia) was recommended by Pontus Granström on the [Dual N-Back mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training) for boosting energy & mental clarity. It is fairly cheap (~$13 for 30 ounces) and tastes surprisingly good; it has a very bad reputation in some parts, but seems to be in the middle of a [rehabilitation](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/dining/02Appe.html). Seth Robert's [Buttermind experiment](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/29/the-buttermind-experiment/) found no mental benefits to coconut oil (and benefits to eating butter), but I wonder.

The first night I was eating some coconut oil, I did my n-backing past 11 PM; normally that damages my scores, but instead I got 66/66/75/88/77% on D4B and did not feel mentally exhausted by the end. The next day, I performed well on the [Cambridge](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) mental rotations test. An anecdote, of course, and it may be due to the vitamin D I simultaneously started. Or another day, I was slumped under apathy after a promising start to the day; a dose of fish & coconut oil, and 1 last vitamin D, and I was back to feeling chipper and optimist. Unfortunately I haven't been testing out coconut oil & vitamin D separately, so who knows which is to thank. But still interesting.

After several weeks of regularly consuming coconut oil and using up the first jar of 15oz, I'm no longer particularly convinced it was doing anything. (I've found it's pretty good for frying eggs, though.) Several days after using up the second jar, I notice no real difference in mood or energy or DNB scores.

# Creatine

[Creatine](!Wikipedia) monohydrate was another early essay of mine - cheap (because it's so popular with the bodybuilder types), and with a very good safety record. I bought some from Bulk Powders and combined it with my then-current regimen (piracetam+choline).

I'm not a bodybuilder, but my interest was sparked by several studies showing IQ boosts (such as [Rae 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691485/); however, Rae 2003 was only in vegetarians, who are known to be creatine deficient (much like B vitamins, creatine is usually gotten in one's diet from meat), and the other studies are likewise of subpopulations. [Rawson 2008](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T0P-4SHF4KD-5/2/c77ebd9c168b601c62ab0b3c36678689) studied young omnivores who are not stupid or sleep-deprived, and found no mental benefit. The summary of the [DNB ML discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fe4ee2f0c994e40e/d24bcf30c083ec3e) was that Rawson 2008 is a broad null result for healthy young omnivores who aren't idiots. Vegetarians, idiots, the sleep-deprived, and old people may benefit from creatine supplementation.

As I am not the latter, I didn't *really* expect a mental benefit. As it happens, I observed nothing. What surprised me was something I had forgotten about: physical benefits. My performance in [Taekwondo](!Wikipedia) classes suddenly improved - specifically, my endurance increased substantially. Before, classes had left me nearly prostrate at the end, but after, I was weary yet fairly alert and happy. (I have done Taekwondo since I was 7, and I have a pretty good sense of what is and is not normal performance for my body. This was not simply failing to notice increasing fitness or something.) This was driven home to me one day when in a flurry before class, I prepared my customary tea with piracetam, choline & creatine; by the middle of the class, I was feeling faint, had to take a break, and suddenly, thunderstruck, realized that I had absentmindedly forgot to actually drink it! This made me a believer.

# Fish oil

[Fish oil](!Wikipedia) provides benefits relating to general mood and anti-schizophrenia; it is one of the better supplements one can take[^research]. The benefits of omega acids seem to be real: I noticed an effect on [my dual n-back scores](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/78e54d222e2c268b/44526d276379dded).

The price is not as good as multivitamins or melatonin; I took 4 capsules a day for roughly 4000mg of omega acids. The jar of 400 is 100 days' worth, and costs ~$17, or around 17¢ a day. The general health benefits push me over the edge of favoring its indefinite use.

So I looked into what straight liquid would cost; unsurprisingly, they are much more cost-effective than pills (but like with the powders, straight fish oil isn't very appetizing) - I bought 4 bottles (16 fluid ounces each) for [$53.31](http://www.iherb.com/Nature-s-Answer-Liquid-Omega-3-Deep-Sea-Fish-Oil-EPA-DHA-Natural-Orange-Flavor-16-fl-oz-480-ml/7908) total (thanks to coupons & sales), and each bottle lasts around a month and a half for perhaps half a year, or ~$100 for a year's supply. Very reasonable indeed.

# Huperzine-A

My [experience report](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/6e35c60f904c2417):

One for the 'null hypothesis' files - Huperzine-A did nothing for me. Unlike piracetam or fish oil, after a full bottle^[[Source Naturals](http://www.amazon.com/Huperzine-A-200mcg-120-tabs/dp/B000WJH2HI/), 120 pills at 200mcg each/], I noticed no side-effects, no mental improvements of any kind, and no changes in DNB scores from straight Huperzine-A.

Possible confounding factors:

- youth: I am considerably younger than the other poster who uses HA
- I only tested a few days with choline+H-A (but I didn't notice anything beyond the choline there).
- counterfeiting? Source Naturals is supposed to be trustworthy, but rare herbal products are most susceptible to fake goods.

It's really too bad. H-A is cheap, compact, doesn't taste at all, and in general is much easier to take than fish oil (and *much* easier to swallow than piracetam or choline!). But if it doesn't deliver, it doesn't deliver.

# Hydergine

[Hydergine](!Wikipedia) was another disappointment (like the [adrafinil](#adrafinil), purchased from Anti-Aging Systems/[Antiaging Central](http://antiagingcentral.com/store/catalog/index.php?cPath=29)). I noticed little to nothing that couldn't be normal daily variation.

# Lion's Mane mushroom

_[Hericium erinaceus](!Wikipedia)_ was recommended strongly by several on the [ImmInst.org](http://www.imminst.org/forum/) forums for its long-term benefits to learning, apparently linked to [Nerve growth factor](!Wikipedia). Highly speculative stuff, and it's unclear whether the mushroom powder I bought was the right form to take (ImmInst.org discussions seem to universally assume one is taking an alcohol or hotwater extract). It tasted nice, though, and I mixed it into my sleeping pills (which contain melatonin & tryptophan). I'll probably never know whether the $30 for 0.5lb was well-spent or not.

# Lithium

[Lithium](!Wikipedia) has a lot of interesting properties^[eg. see _Discover_'s ["The Metal Marvel That Has Mended Brains for 50 Years"](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/the-brain-2/27-metal-marvel-mended-brains-50-years-lithium/), or its connection to [DHA](!Wikipedia "Docosahexaenoic acid") and thus fish oil: ["How lithium works in the brain"](http://machineslikeus.com/news/how-lithium-works-brain)] besides its famous effectiveness for manic-depression. [Lithium orotate](!Wikipedia) is sold commercially in low-doses; I purchased 200 pills with 5mg of lithium each. To put this dosage in comparison, the [therapeutic](!Wikipedia "Lithium pharmacology") doses of lithium are roughly 100x higher (around 500mg), while the natural drinking water levels - shown to [decrease crimes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699579) or [suicides](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/5/464) ([PDF](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/194/5/464.pdf)) or increase [longevity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21301855) ([PDF](http://www.springerlink.com/index/P3JP2013K4P5TQ3K.pdf)) - peak at ~0.5mg or >10x less. The pills are small and tasteless, and not at all hard to take.

Some suggested that the lithium would turn me into a 'zombie'. (There are serious negative effects to taking a lot of lithium - [2-4 grams will trash](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699579) your long-term memory. But at 5mg for 200 pills, I'd have to eat every one to get up to 1 gram, so I'm not worried about overdosing.) To test this, I took on day 1 & 2 no less than 4 pills or 20mg as a 'attack dose'; I didn't notice any significant change in emotional affect or energy levels. It may've helped my motivation, though I am also trying out the tyrosine.

Some weeks later, I'm still not sure. When I began putting all of my nootropic powders into pill-form, I put half a lithium pill in each, and nevertheless ran out of lithium fairly quickly (3kg of piracetam makes for >4000 OO-size pills); those capsules were buried at the bottom of the bucket under lithium-less pills. In effect, I suddenly went cold-turkey on lithium. Reflecting on the past 2 weeks, I seem to have been less optimistic and productive, with items lingering on my TODO list that I had been finding easier. An effect? Possibly. If I ever develop some good metrics for measuring general 'getting things done'-iveness, I should revisit lithium.

# Melatonin

See [Melatonin]().

# Modafinil

See [Modafinil]() for background.

Here are the notes I jotted down while trying out modafinil back in November 2009. I didn't make any effort to write sensibly, so this makes my lucidity seem much worse than it actually was:

Thursday: 3g piracetam/4g choline bitartate at 1; 1 200mg modafinil at 2:20; noticed a 'leveling' of fatigue by 3:30; dry eyes? no bad after taste or anything. a little light-headed by 4:30, but mentally clear and focused. wonder if light-headedness is due simply to missing lunch and not modafinil. 5:43: noticed my foot jiggling - doesn't usually jiggle while in piracetam/choline. 7:30: starting feeling a bit jittery & manic - not much or to a problematic level but definitely noticeable; but then, that often happens when I miss lunch & dinner. 12:30: bedtime. Can't sleep even with 3mg of melatonin! Subjectively, I toss & turn (in part thanks to my cat) until 4:30, when I really wake up. I hang around bed for another hour & then give up & get up. After a shower, I feel fairly normal, strangely, though not as good as if I had truly slept 8 hours. The lesson here is to pay attention to wikipedia when it says the half-life is 12-15 hours! About 6AM I take 200mg; all the way up to 2pm I feel increasingly less energetic and unfocused, though when I do apply myself I think as well as ever. Not fixed by food or tea or piracetam/choline. I want to be up until midnight, so I take half a pill of 100mg and chew it (since I'm not planning on staying up all night and I want it to work relatively soon). From 4-12PM, I notice that today as well my heart rate is elevated; I measure it a few times and it seems to average to ~70BPM, which is higher than normal, but not high enough to concern me. I stay up to midnight fine, take 3mg of melatonin at 12:30, and have no trouble sleeping; I think I fall asleep around 1. Alarm goes off at 6, I get up at 7:15 and take the other 100mg. Only 100mg/half-a-pill because I don't want to leave the half laying around in the open, and I'm curious whether 100mg + ~5 hours of sleep will be enough after the last 2 days. Maybe next weekend I'll just go without sleep entirely to see what my limits are.

In general, I feel a little bit less alert, but still close to normal. By 6PM, I have a mild headache, but I try out 30 rounds of gbrainy (haven't played it in months) and am surprised to find that I reach an all-time high; no idea whether this is due to DNB or not, since Gbrainy is very heavily 'crystallized' (half the challenge disappears as you learn how the problems work), but it does indicate I'm not deluding myself about mental ability. (To give a figure: my last score well before I did any DNB was 64, and I was doing well that day; on modafinil, I had a 77.) I figure the headache might be food related, eat, and by 7:30 the headache is pretty much gone and I'm fine up to midnight.
I took 1.5mg of melatonin, and went to bed at ~1:30AM; I woke up around 6:30, took a modafinil pill/200mg, and felt pretty reasonable. By noon my mind started to feel a bit fuzzy, and lunch didn't make much of it go away. I've been looking at studies, and users seem to degrade after 30 hours; I started on mid-Thursday, so call that 10 hours, then 24 (Friday), 24 (Saturday), and 14 (Sunday), totaling 72hrs with <20hrs sleep; this might be equivalent to 52hrs with no sleep, and [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Modafinil") writes:

> One study of helicopter pilots suggested that 600 mg of modafinil given in three doses can be used to keep pilots alert and maintain their accuracy at pre-deprivation levels for 40 hours without sleep.[60] However, significant levels of nausea and vertigo were observed. Another study of fighter pilots showed that modafinil given in three divided 100 mg doses sustained the flight control accuracy of sleep-deprived F-117 pilots to within about 27 percent of baseline levels for 37 hours, without any considerable side effects.[61] In an 88-hour sleep loss study of simulated military grounds operations, 400 mg/day doses were mildly helpful at maintaining alertness and performance of subjects compared to placebo, but the researchers concluded that this dose was not high enough to compensate for most of the effects of complete sleep loss.

If I stop tonight and do nothing Monday (and I sleep the normal eight hours and do not pay any penalty), then that'll be 4 out of 5 days on modafinil, each saving 3 or 4 hours. Each day took one pill which cost me $1.20, but each pill saved let's call it 3.5 hours; if I value my time at minimum wage, or 7.25/hr (federal minimum wage), then that 3.5 hours is worth $25.37, which is much more than $1.20, ~21x more.

My mental performance continues as before; curiously, I get an even higher score on Gbrainy, despite being sure I was less sharp than yesterday. Either I'm wrong about that, or Gbrainy is even more trainable than I thought. I go to bed Sunday around 1AM, and get up around 8AM (so call it 6 or 7 hours).

Monday: It's a long day ahead of me, so I take 200mg. Reasonable performance.

Tuesday: I went to bed at 1am, and first woke up at 6am, and I wrote down a dream; the lucid dreaming book I was reading advised that waking up in the morning and then going back for a short nap often causes lucid dreams, so I tried that - and wound up waking up at 10am with no dreams at all. Oops. I take a pill, but the whole day I don't feel so hot, although my conversation and arguments seem as cogent as ever. I'm also having a terrible time focusing on any actual work. At 8 I take another; I'm behind on too many things, and it looks like I need an all-nighter to catch up. The dose is no good; at 11, I still feel like at 8, possibly worse, and I take another along with the choline+piracetam (which makes a total of 600mg for the day). Come 12:30, and I disconsolately note that I don't seem any better, although I still seem to understand the IQ essays I am reading. I wonder if this is tolerance to modafinil, or perhaps sleep catching up to me? Possibly it's just that I don't remember what the quasi-light-headedness of modafinil felt like. I feel this sort of zombie-like state without change to 4am, so it must be doing something, when I give up and go to bed, getting up at 7:30 without too much trouble. Some N-backing at 9am gives me some low scores (24%,40%) but also some pretty high scores (71%,67%), which suggests I can perform normally if I concentrate. I take another pill and am fine the rest of the day, going to bed at 1am as usual.

Thursday: this is an important day where I really need to be awake. I'm up around 8, take a pill, and save one for later; I'll take half a pill at noon and the other half at 2. This works very well, and I don't feel tired well up to midnight, even though I spent an hour walking.

Friday: alarm clock woke me at 7:40, but I somehow managed to go back to sleep until 9:40. Perhaps sleep inertia is building up despite the modafinil. Another pill. I am in general noticing less effect, but I'll not take any this weekend to see whether I have simply gotten used to it.

Sat/Sun: bed at 1/2AM, awake at 10/11 respectively. Generally unmotivated.

Mon: went to bed at 11:30 Sun, woke at 7:30 and dozed to 8. 200mg at 8:30

(On a side note, I think I understand now why modafinil doesn't lead to a _[Beggars in Spain](!Wikipedia)_ scenario; BiS includes massive IQ and motivation boosts as part of the Sleepless modification. Just adding 8 hours a day doesn't do the world-changing trick, no more than some researchers living to 90 and others to 60 has lead to the former taking over. If everyone were suddenly granted the ability to never need sleep, many of them would have no idea what to do with the extra 8 or 9 hours and might well be destroyed by the gift; it takes a lot of motivation to make good use of the time, and if one cannot, then it is a curse akin to the stories of immortals who yearn for death - they yearn because life is not a blessing to them, though that is a fact more about them than life.)

# Oxiracetam

[Oxiracetam](!Wikipedia) is one of the 3 most popular -racetams; less popular than piracetam but seems to be more popular than aniracetam. Prices have come down significantly since the early 2000s, and stand at around [1.2g/$](https://www.smartpowders.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=2056) or roughly 50 cents a dose, which was low enough to experiment with; key question, does it stack with piracetam or is it redundant for me? (Oxiracetam can't compete on price with my piracetam pile stockpile.)

I bought 60 grams from Smart Powders (as usual) and combined it with the DMAE; I couldn't compare oxiracetam+DMAE vs oxiracetam+choline-bitrate because I had capped all the choline with the piracetam. One immediate advantage of oxiracetam: it is not unbelievably foul tasting like piracetam, but slightly sweet.

Regardless, while in the absence of piracetam, I did notice some stimulant effects (somewhat negative - more aggressive than usual while driving) and similar effects to piracetam, I did *not* notice any mental performance beyond piracetam when using them both. The most I can say is that on some nights, I seemed to be less easily tired when writing or editing or n-backing (see below), but those were nights I was *also* trying out all the other things I had gotten in that order from Smart Powders, and I am still dis-entangling what was responsible. (Probably the [l-theanine](#theanine) or [sulbutiamine](#sulbutiamine).)

In other words, for me they did not seem to 'stack'. The following are a number of n-back scores from before (piracetam only) and after (piracetam and oxiracetam), grouped by day:

    [28,39,26,48,34]
    [34,60]
    [37,53,55]
    # started oxiracetam
    [56,66,44,46,30,24,50,56,34,39,34]
    [30,50,31,37,41,23]
    [53,35,40]

Oxiracetam has smaller recommended doses than piracetam, but is still more expensive. I will continue to

# Piracetam

So as you may remember, I bought 500g of [piracetam](!Wikipedia) from Smart Powders (piracetam is one of the cheapest nootropics and SP one of the cheapest suppliers; the others are [much more expensive](http://users4.jabry.com/isochroma/Racetam%20Prices.htm)), and I've tried it out for several days (started on 7 September 2009, and used it steadily up to mid-December). I've varied my dose from 3 grams to 12 grams (at least, I think the little scoop measures in grams), taking them in my tea or bitter fruit juice (cranberry works best, although orange juice masks it pretty well). 3 grams (alone) didn't seem to do much of anything while 12 grams gave me a nasty headache. I also ate 2 or 3 eggs a day.

Subjectively, I don't notice drastic changes. Here's what I do notice:

- My thinking seems a little clearer
- I'm not so easy to tire - I went through a month's worth of my Wikipedia watchlist with less fatigue than usual, and n-backing doesn't seem so tiring.
- [DNB](!Wikipedia "Dual N-back")-wise, eyeballing my stats file seems to indicate a small increase: when I compare peak scores D4B scores, I see mostly 50s and a few 60s before piracetam, and after starting piracetam, a few 70s mixed into the 50s and 60s. Natural increase from training? Dunno - I've been stuck on D4B since June, so 5 or 10% in a week or 3 seems a little suspicious. The full list of scores from then to now is:
> 28,61,36,25,61,57,39,56,23,37,24,50,54,32,50,33,16,42,41,40,34,33,31,65,23,36,29,51,46,31,45,52,30,50,29,36,57,60,34,48,32,41,48,34,51,40,53,73,56,53,53,57,46,50,35,50,60,62,30,60,48,46,52,60,60,48,47,34,50,51,45,54,70,48,61,43,53,60,44,57,50,50,52,37,55,40,53,48,50,52,44,50,50,38,43,66,40,24,67,60,71,54,51,60,41,58,20,28,42,53,59,42,31,60,42,58,36,48,53,46,25,53,57,60,35,46,32,26,68,45,20,51,56,48,25,62,50,54,47,42,55,39,60,44,32,50,34,60,47,70,68,38,47,48,70,51,42,41,35,36,39,23,50,46,44,56,50,39
- The other day, I also noticed I was fidgeting less
- After a week or two, I *think* I noticed better reflexes - both in catching falling cups and the [saccading](!Wikipedia "Saccade") in BW seems slightly easier. But I could be imagining this since I just saw an Erowid report mentioning better reflexes & I may've read that one before I started. (Darn those subconscious impressions and memories! :)

After 7 days, I ordered a kg of [choline](!Wikipedia) bitartate from <http://www.bulkpowders.com>. I figured I couldn't fairly test piracetam without some regular choline - the eggs might not be enough, might be the wrong kind, etc. It has a quite distinctly fishy smell, but the actual taste is more citrus-y, and it seems to neutralize the piracetam taste in tea (which makes things much easier for me).

The first day (22 September) I took ~10g since I was taking 5g of piracetam; I wound up with some diarrhea & farting. Oops.

On the plus side:
- I noticed the less-fatigue thing to a greater extent, getting out of my classes much less tired than usual. (Caveat: my sleep schedule recently changed for the saner recently, so it's possible that's responsible. I think it's more the piracetam+choline, though.)
- One thing I wasn't expecting was a decrease in my appetite - nobody had mentioned that in their reports.I don't like being bothered by my appetite (I know how to eat fine without it reminding me), so I count this as a plus.
- Fidgeting was reduced further

The second day I went with ~6g of choline; much less intestinal distress, but similar effects vis-a-vis fidgeting, loss of appetite, & reduced fatigue.

So in general I thought this was a positive experience, but I'm not sure it was worth $40 for ~2 months' worth, and it was tedious consuming it.

# Selegiline / Deprenyl

[Selegiline](!Wikipedia) (also known as Deprenyl) is a somewhat popular ([Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Selegeline.shtml), [r/nootropics](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/search?q=selegiline+OR+deprenyl&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance)) stimulant/anti-depressant which affects dopamine. I ordered it & modafinil from [Nubrain.com](http://www.nubrain.com/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=12) at $35 for 60x5mg. Dosage is apparently 5-10mg a day, so presumably that's ~60 days. (Prices can be better elsewhere; selegiline is popular for treating dogs with senile dementia, where those 60x5mg will cost [$_2_](http://www.petcarerx.com/pcrx/ProductPages/Product.aspx?pid=10983) rather than $35[^economics]. One needs a veterinarian's prescription to purchase from pet-oriented online pharmacies, though.)

[^economics]: One might expect some sort of catch - surely there's a massive quality difference to go with the massive price difference? But there could well not be; I would not be surprised to learn that the dog selegiline and the human selegiline came out of the same vat.

    It's basic economics: the price of a good must be greater than cost of producing said good, but only under [perfect competition](!Wikipedia) will price = cost. Otherwise, the price is simply whatever maximizes profit for the seller. (Bottled water doesn't *really* cost $2 to produce.) This can lead to apparently counter-intuitive consequences involving [price discrimination](!Wikipedia) & [market segmentation](!Wikipedia) - such as ['damaged' goods](!Wikipedia "Damaged good#Computer hardware") which are the premium product which has been deliberately degraded and sold for less (some [Intel](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/18/intel-wants-to-charge-50-to-unlock-stuff-your-cpu-can-already-d/) CPUs, some [headphones](http://mikebeauchamp.com/misc/sennheiser-hd-555-to-hd-595-mod/) etc.).

    Price discrimination is aided by barriers such as oligopolies, which there clearly is in the case of using veterinary drugs on humans - any doctor to do so would probably be guilty of medical malpractice or similar charges. Similarly, we can predict that whenever there is a veterinary drug which is chemically identical to a human drug, the veterinary drug will be much cheaper than the human drug because pet owners do not value their pets more than themselves. Human drugs are ostensibly held to a higher standard than veterinary drugs; so if veterinary prices are *higher*, then there will be incentive to simply buy the cheaper human version and 'downgrade' them to veterinary drugs.

# Sulbutiamine

[2 experiences](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/an862/whos_had_experience_with_sulbutiamine/) with [sulbutiamine](!Wikipedia) on Reddit.

My general impression is positive; it does seem to help with endurance and extended the effect of piracetam+choline, but is not as effective as that combo. At $20 for 30g (bought from Smart Powders), I'm not sure it's worthwhile, but I think at $10 it would probably be worthwhile.

It's worth noting that sulbutiamine reports vary dramatically, and it seems possible that some people are thiamine-deficient and so would disproportionately; [SilasBarta](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2q0/intelligence_amplification_open_thread/2mv4?c=1) noticed little to nothing (like me), but [Jimrandomh](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2kl/open_thread_august_2010_part_2/2j0z?c=1) reports his life was transformed (and he suspects that his diabetes caused or exacerbated a deficiency).

# Theanine

[Theanine](!Wikipedia) is occasionally mentioned on Reddit or Imminst or LessWrong[^lwtheanine] but is rarely a top-level post or article; this is probably because theanine was discovered a very long time ago (>61 years ago), and it's a pretty straightforward substance. It's a weak relaxant/[anxiolytic](!Wikipedia)^[If you don't like Wikipedia's citations on this, see also [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=theanine+anxiety).] which is probably responsible for a number of the [health benefits](!Wikipedia "Health effects of tea") of tea, and which seems to work well with [caffeine](#caffeine) (and is probably why caffeine delivered through coffee feels different from the same amount consumed in tea)

[^lwtheanine]: See for example the mentions in ["A rationalist's guide to psychoactive drugs"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/45u/a_rationalists_guide_to_psychoactive_drugs/) or the discussion in the post ["Coffee: When it helps, when it hurts"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1w1/coffee_when_it_helps_when_it_hurts/1qiu); see also the description of a rare [*bad* experience](http://lesswrong.com/lw/20w/open_thread_april_2010/1ubp) with theanine.

I purchased from Smart Powders ([20g for $7](http://www.smartpowders.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=sp128)); as before, some light searching seemed to turn up SP as the best seller given shipping overhead. It was on sale and I planned to cap it so I got 80g. This may seem like a lot, but I was highly confident that theanine and I would get along since I already drink so much tea and was a tad annoyed at the edge I got with straight caffeine. So far I'm pretty happy with it. My goal was to eliminate the physical & mental 'twitchiness' of caffeine, which it seems to do.

# Tryptophan

l-[Tryptophan](!Wikipedia) is in a sense redundant with taking [melatonin](#Melatonin), since melatonin is one of the most prominent metabolites of tryptophan. Nevertheless, subjectively I seem to sleep better by taking 1.5mg of melatonin & 0.5g of tryptophan than I do by taking, say, 3mg of melatonin.

One of the other suggested benefits is for boosting serotonin levels; low levels of serotonin are implicated in a number of issues like depression. I'm not yet sure whether tryptophan has helped with motivation or happiness. Trial and error has taught me that it's a bad idea to take tryptophan in the morning or afternoon, however, even smaller quantities like 0.25g. Like melatonin, the dose-response curve is a U: ~1g is great and induces multiple vivid dreams for me, but ~1.5g leads to an awful night and a headache the next day that was worse, if anything, than melatonin.

Taking the tryptophan is fairly difficult. The powder as supplied by Bulk Nutrition is *extraordinarily* dry and fine; it seems to be positively [hydrophobic](!Wikipedia). The first time I tried to swallow a teaspoon, I nearly coughed it out - the power had seemed to explode in my mouth and go down my lungs. Thenceforth I made sure to have a mouth of water first. After a while, I took a different tack: I mixed in as much [_Hericium_](#lions-mane-mushroom) as would fit in the container. The mushroom powder is wetter and chunkier than the tryptophan, and seems to reduce the problem. Combining the mix with chunks of melatonin inside a pill works even better.

# Tyrosine

[Tyrosine](!Wikipedia) is an amino acid; people on the Imminst.org forums (as well as Wikipedia) suggest that it helps with energy and coping with stress. I ordered 4oz  (bought from Smart Powders) to try it out, and I began taking 1g with my usual caffeine+piracetam+choline mix. It does not dissolve easily in hot water, and is very chalky and not especially tasty. I have not noticed any particular effects from it.

# Vitamin D

Bought 5,000 IU soft-gels of [Vitamin D](!Wikipedia)-3 because I was feeling very apathetic in January 2011 and not getting much done, even slacking on regular habits like [Mnemosyne]() or [dual n-back](N-back FAQ) or my [Wikipedia watchlist](!Wikipedia "Help:Watching pages"). Introspecting, I  was reminded of depression & [dysthymia](!Wikipedia) & [seasonal affective disorder](!Wikipedia). There are a number of treatments for the last. I already use melatonin]. I sort of have [light therapy](!Wikipedia) from a [full-spectrum](!Wikipedia "Full-spectrum light") fluorescent desk lamp. But I get very little sunlight; the surprising thing would be if I *didn't* have a vitamin D deficiency.

The soft gels are very small; one needs to be a bit careful - [overdose starts](!Wikipedia "Hypervitaminosis D") in the range of 70,000 IU, so 14 pills would be enough, and it's unclear where problems start with chronic use^[Vitamin D, like many supplements, [follows](http://www.ajcn.org/content/69/5/842.full) [a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19444937) [U-shaped](http://www.ajcn.org/content/early/2010/08/18/ajcn.2010.29749.abstract) [response curve](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2010/03/03/jn.109.119636.abstract) - too much can be quite as bad as too little. Too little, though, can be [very bad](http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2009/jan2009_Millions-of-Needless-Deaths_01.htm).]. 10,000 IU is probably more than enough and is similar to what one might get from an hour on the beach.

# TODO

- [Naringenin](!Wikipedia) - Timothy Ferriss in excerpt from _Four-hour Body_ claims it extends effectiveness of caffeine (how to buy - capsule? grape fruit concentrate?)

## Nicotine

One of the reasons tobacco became so popular in the 1600s, along with tea & coffee (for their caffeine), was that nicotine is a powerful stimulant. Obvious enough; it affects [tons of systems](!Wikipedia "Nicotine#Psychoactive effects"). Less obvious is that nicotine has many [beneficial effects](!Wikipedia "Nicotine#Therapeutic uses") (and these benefits may be related to [anomalous](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/12/animal-smoking-studies.html) [smoking](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/12/smoking-followup.html) [results](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/12/what-anti-smoking-evidence.html)[^fisher]); the infamous deadliness of smoking would seem to be almost solely from the smoke, not the nicotine[^snus] Even less obvious is that nicotine itself may not be especially addictive^[Wikipedia summarizes [Guillem 2005](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/38/8593) as "Technically, nicotine is not significantly addictive, as nicotine administered alone does not produce significant reinforcing properties." - the addictiveness coming from [MAOI](!Wikipedia)s present in tobacco.].

[^fisher]: It's generally assumed that the tobacco industry held off regulation for so many decades simply because it spent so very much on lobbying; but lobbying isn't omnipotent (look at Prohibition). I think at least part of it is that the evidence is not as strong as one would expect. The great statistician [R.A Fisher](!Wikipedia) has often been excoriated for testifying in favor of the tobacco industry and implied to have sold his soul for blood-money, but can we really be that critical when we [read](http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/fisher274.pdf) his arguments ([background](http://members.iinet.net.au/~ray/TSSOASb.html)):

    > "There were fewer inhalers among the cancer patients than among the non-cancer patients. That, I think, is an exceedingly important finding."
[^snus]: For example, [snus](!Wikipedia "Snus#Health consequences"), a sort of chewing tobacco, has been studied extensively in Sweden where it is very popular, with little hard evidence of significant harm. Smokeless tobacco in general is hugely more safe than smoking (["Smokeout: Not as easy as ABC"](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/nov/12/20051112-102753-2328r/), _Washington Times_):

    > "Modern smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine in addictive doses to satisfy smokers’ cravings. University research has documented that smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco reduce their risk for all smoking-related illnesses, including oral cancer. On average, smokers live 8 years less than those who never used tobacco; smokeless users lose just 15 days. Statistically, smokeless users have about the same risk of dying as automobile users."

    Which would seem to suggest the following line of thought: if the research on actual smoking is equivocal, and then the demonstrated harm of non-smoking tobacco is so minimal (even if we ignore equivocalness), then how much safer would be just nicotine on its own as a patch/pill?

If you've read through this page and also read the Wikipedia page on nicotine, your eye was probably caught by the mention that nicotine affects the cholinergic system - the same system piracetam affects. (This might make nicotine redundant with piracetam or other nootropics that affect acetylcholine or acetylcholinesterase, such as huperzine-A, but it's been argued against.^[One [Imminst.org](!Wikipedia) [poster](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/46040-ex-smoker-using-nicotine/page__view__findpost__p__447780) argues that "I don't think that's all there is to nicotine's mode of action. Choline is counter-indicated for OCD and can make it worse, yet there's many studies showing nicotine's efficacy in treating even refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder." For the OCD studies, see [Lundberg 2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15610934), [Pasquini 2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15610960), and [Salín-Pascual 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15011734) among others.])

Indeed, the research literature is full of results connecting nicotine with improved mental performance:

    > "There were sufficient effect size data to conduct meta-analyses on nine performance domains, including motor abilities, alerting and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. We found significant positive effects of nicotine or smoking on six domains: fine motor, alerting attention-accuracy and response time (RT), orienting attention-RT, short-term episodic memory-accuracy, and working memory-RT (effect size range = 0.16 to 0.44)."
- nicotine [confirmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19665344) to have short-term boosts to "attention and memory"^[That study does find acceleration of dementia in long-term usage, but importantly, the long-term studies are of *tobacco* use, not nicotine gum/lozenges/patches.]

Anecdotally, [a](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/27759-nicotine-and-acetycholine-nootropics/page__view__findpost__p__300423) [great](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/8742-experimenting-with-the-nicotine-patch/page__view__findpost__p__86840) [many](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/9481-nicotine-patch-works-good-for-add/page__view__findpost__p__95355) [Imminst](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/23915-nicotine-patch-for-focus-a-log/page__view__findpost__p__258639) posters report a positive experience which is similar to, but better than, the extremely popular amphetamine formulation [Adderall](!Wikipedia); a few also favorably compare it to [caffeine](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/23915-nicotine-patch-for-focus-a-log/page__view__findpost__p__367943). (These anecdotes are supported by a [historical survey](http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/lmd29e00) which reports that the 2 highest rates of hourly consumption were during work hours, and that "Of these three groups [surveyed], 86% of the clinic group, 83% of the students, and 59%Z of the hospital workers agreed with the statement that 'smoking helps me think and concentrate'.")

Besides the nootropic effects, nicotine can be used as an extremely precise self-reward. [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/about-less-wrong) user [Wedrifid](http://lesswrong.com/user/wedrifid/), has a [fascinating series of comments](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2cv/defeating_ugh_fields_in_practice/264j):

> I have had success working around 'Ugh' reactions to various activities. I took the direct approach. I (intermittently) use nicotine lozenges as a stimulant while exercising. Apart from boosting physical performance and motivation it also happens to be the most potent substance I am aware of for increasing habit formation in the brain...
>
> And I do use nicotine for studying at times (usually patches that I have cut into the desired dose). Partly for learning mental habits and partly for enhanced focus and motivation without the agitation that comes (with methamphetamine (at least, for me). Again, I don't swear by it but it works...^[<http://lesswrong.com/lw/2cv/defeating_ugh_fields_in_practice/26lu>]
>
> I have never smoked a cigarette. Nor have I ever had a remote tendency towards addiction to any substance. That is even one of the reasons I gave when describing why this is an effective technique for me personally. I am more at risk of becoming addicted to discussing substances on the internet than the substances themselves....
>
> I should note that the role nicotine lozenges are taking here is not primarily as a training reward, like giving the rat electronically stimulated orgasms when it presses the lever. Nicotine isn't particularly strong in that role compared to alternatives (such as abusing ritalin), at least when it is not administered by a massive hit straight into the brain via the lungs. No, the particular potency of nicotine is that it potentates the formation of habits for activities undertaken while under the influence by means more fundamental than a 'mere' stimulus-reward mechanism. Habits that are found to be harder to extinct than an impulse to take a drug. This is what makes smoking so notoriously hard to quit even with patches and makes the use of fake cigarettes to suck on useful."^[<http://lesswrong.com/lw/2cv/defeating_ugh_fields_in_practice/268a>]

This use of nicotine to strengthen habits is in accord with at least some research into nicotine:^[["Nicotine Creates Stronger Memories, Cues To Drug Use"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090909122052.htm), _Science Daily_ 2009]

> '"Our brains normally make these associations between things that support our existence and environmental cues so that we conduct behaviors leading to successful lives. The brain sends a reward signal when we act in a way that contributes to our well being," said Dr. John A. Dani, professor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the study. "However, nicotine commandeers this subconscious learning process in the brain so we begin to behave as though smoking is a positive action." Dani said that environmental events linked with smoking can become cues that prompt the smoking urge. Those cues could include alcohol, a meal with friends, or even the drive home from work. To understand why these associations are so strong, Dani and Dr. Jianrong Tang, instructor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the report, decided to record brain activity of mice as they were exposed to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco.
>
> ...
>
> "The brain activity change was just amazing," Dani said. "Compared to injections of saline, nicotine strengthened neuronal connections – sometimes up to 200 percent. This strengthening of connections underlies new memory formation."..."We found that nicotine could strengthen neuronal synaptic connections only when the so called reward centers sent a dopamine signal. That was a critical process in creating the memory associations even with bad behavior like smoking."'

Price is not an issue. Nicotine in the US is not as expensive as one might intuitively guess from sky-high cigarette prices & widespread tobacco smuggling; perhaps due to the intrinsic low cost of nicotine or because it is politically unpalatable to tax products which are largely used by people quitting smoking, prices for a 2mg dose of nicotine is easily in the 15-20 cents range:

- for example, one [Nicorette gum](http://www.amazon.com/Nicorette-Coated-pieces-Fresh-Mint/dp/B00062NVVW/) product offers 100 4mg gums for $38.56, or 39 cents a gum, or if you split one in half to get a 2mg dose, 18 cents a dose.
- a random [nicotine lozenge](http://www.amazon.com/Flavor-4%252dmg%252e-Nicotine-Lozenges-ct%252e/dp/B003XLEILU/) product is 144 4mg lozenges for $42.68, 30 cents per lozenge, and 15 cents per 2mg.

2mg may be too much for a non-smoker like me, in which case prices per dose drop further. Nor have I looked hard^[Posters on Imminst.org give numbers for nicotine patches that are <$1 per day of normal use, but say they cut them up into as many as 10 pieces to reduce them to the 2-3mg dose level - which implies per dose costs of <10 cents.] for low prices; just grabbed random hits on Amazon. You could probably drive it down to the 5-10 cents range with canny shopping and buying in bulk (nicotine is an insecticide, not a perishable foodstuff, so you could buy years' worth - just like with melatonin).

So, what are the gotchas?

1. Tolerance may be a problem. [Posters](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/46273-nicotine-patch-decreases-hdl/page__view__findpost__p__449683) [report](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/23915-nicotine-patch-for-focus-a-log/page__view__findpost__p__262776) (like with most stimulants, and perhaps [modafinil](Modafinil#tolerance)); their anecdotes are supported by general observations that smokers tend to escalate their smoking habit and by findings that nicotine [down-regulates its receptors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8371136) in mice.

    On the other hand, even if one does develop tolerance to nicotine, that simply suggests spacing it out or rotating with other stimulants. One could imagine a 3-day cycle: nicotine, caffeine, and modafinil.
2. Nicotine is well-known to cause [vasoconstriction](!Wikipedia) (higher blood pressure) which concerns [people](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/38572-nicotine-and-vasoconstriction/)

    But the increase may not be all that large, especially at a low non-smoker dose; and if there is blood pressure increase, it may be perfectly tolerable.^[In another example of how divided the nicotine research is, [Papua New Guinean farmers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8077891) with 80% smoking rates still have less heart diseases and fewer strokes than the Swedish.]
3. Research on nicotine turns up all sorts of possible ways nicotine could be unhealthy ([perhaps](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11050152) it metabolizes to a carcinogen among other things or cause mutations[^mutant])

    But nicotine has been so intensively studied that we ought to expect a lot of scary looking correlations and possibilities even if nicotine were the bee's knees, and it can be difficult to interpret the overall mass of studies. (There are a lot of links here, but only a fraction of the ones I've seen.) One [forumite](http://www.mindandmuscle.net/forum/topic/41608-nicotine-gum/page__view__findpost__p__593879) illustrates the problem: "Consider acne. Nicotine increases keratinocyte differentiation, increases sebum production, etc. It seems like it would induce acne. Yet, overall studies show nicotine use is associated with significantly less acne, purportedly due to other anti-inflammatory mechanisms...nicotine is unfortunately far more complex and difficult to understand."
4. You could become addicted despite everything. Hypothetically, this could then lead to tobacco use with all the attendant ills.

    This is a truly subjective one. Former smokers probably should not be monkeying about with nicotine. Some people are scared this might happen; others aren't worried at all. Given what I've read about nicotine not being addictive but strengthening habits (see previous quotes from Wedrifid), I think this fear might be overblown.

So what's the upshot? I think I'm interested in at least giving it a try. The negatives universally seem to be long-term negatives, and even if nicotine turns out to be something I haul out only in a crisis or every few weeks, it might still have been worth investigating.

[^mutant]: ["Nicotine: Potentially a Multifunctional Carcinogen?"](http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/79/1/1.full):

    > "Although a great deal of work has been carried out on the mutagenicity of the common PAHs found in cigarettes, only a few studies have addressed the genotoxic nature of nicotine itself. Although tests examining point mutagenicity have generally been negative, the alkaloid has been shown in some cases to increase chromosome aberrations in exposed cells (Trivedi et al., 1990). However, findings in this regard have been somewhat inconsistent, thus highlighting the need for further exploration."

# 3 years supply in pill form

Powders are too annoying, and pills expensive in bulk. So since I'm making my own pills, I might as well make a custom formulation using the ones I've found personally effective. And since making pills is tedious, I want to not have to do it again for years. 3 years seems like a good interval - 1095 days. Since one is often busy and mayn't take that day's pills (there are enough ingredients it has to be multiple pills), it's safe to round it down to a nice even 1000 days.

So, we omit tryptophan because it seems most useful for sleeping and this is a stimulus pill meant for daytime usage. That leaves from the above the following, with some basic commercial specs from the usual retailers:

We calculate how many days each unit gets us simply by dose divided by dose per day. We get quite a range; with some products, we only need 4 units to cover at least 1000 days, but we need 100 units for modafinil!

Ingredient        Units   Cost
----------------  -----   ----
aniracetam        6       $300
caffeine          5       $90
choline citrate   4       $68
creatine          4       $68
lithium orotate   8       $88
modafinil         100     $800
sulbutiamine      9       $180
theanine          5       $50

Sum total, $1644, or $1.65 per day for the ingredients.

But how many pills does this make and how much do those pills cost?

[Capsule Connection](http://www.capsuleconnection.com/) sells 1000 00 pills (the largest pills) for $9. I already have a pill machine, so that doesn't count (a sunk cost). If we sum the grams per day column from the first table, we get 9.75 grams a day. Each 00 pill can take around 0.75 grams, so we need 13 pills. (Creatine is very bulky, alas.) 13 pills per day for 1000 days is 13,000 pills, and 1,000 pills is $9 so we need 13 units and 13 times 9 is $117.

Redoing the above, the total expense is $1761 or $1.76 per day.

13 pills a day sounds like a lot, and $1.76 is actually a fair amount per day compared to what most people take. If I couldn't swing a round $1800 (even to cover years of consumption), how would I economize?

Looking at the prices, the overwhelming expense is for modafinil. It's a powerful stimulant - possibly the single most effective ingredient in the list - but dang expensive. If we drop it, the cost drops by a full $800 from $1761 to $961 (almost halving) and to $0.96 per day. A remarkable difference, and if one were genetically insensitive to modafinil, one would definitely want to remove it.

On the other metric, suppose we removed the creatine? Dropping 4 grams of material means we only need to consume 5.75 grams a day, covered by 8 pills (compared to 13 pills). We save 5,000 pills, which would have cost $45 and also don't spend the $68 for the creatine; assuming a modafinil formulation, that drops our $1761 down to $1648 or $1.65 a day. Or we could remove both the creatine and modafinil, for a grand total of $848 or $0.85 a day.
