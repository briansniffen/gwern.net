description: Notes on nootropics I have tried
...

A record of [nootropics](!Wikipedia)^[No entheogens or hallucinogens; those are not the kind of psychoactives that interest me. I also try to stay on the right side of the law, although this can be difficult and limits my options.] I have tried, with thoughts about which ones worked and did not work for me. These anecdotes should be considered only as anecdotes, and one's efforts with nootropics a hobby to put only limited amounts of time into; for an ironic counterpoint, I suggest the reader listen to [a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGxPHolNU3c) of [Jonathan Coulton](!Wikipedia)'s ["I Feel Fantastic"](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/index.php/I_Feel_Fantastic) while reading.

Your mileage *will* vary. There are so many parameters and interactions in the brain that any of them could be [the bottleneck](!Wikipedia "Liebig's law of the minimum") or responsible pathway, and one could fall prey to the common U-shaped [dose-response curve](!Wikipedia) (eg. [Yerkes–Dodson law](!Wikipedia)) but ultimately they all cash out in a very few subjective assessments like 'energetic' or 'motivated', with even apparently precise descriptions like 'working memory' or 'verbal fluency' not telling you much about what the nootropic *actually* did. It's tempting to list the nootropics that worked for *you* and tell everyone to go use them, but that is merely [generalizing from one example](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) (and the more nootropics - or meditation styles, or self-help books, or 'getting things done' systems - you try, the stronger the temptation is to [evangelize](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/)). The best you can do is read all the testimonials and studies and use that to prioritize your list of nootropics to try. You don't know in advance which ones will pay off and which will be wasted. You *can't* know in advance.

I do recommend a few things, like [modafinil](Modafinil) or [melatonin](Melatonin), to many people. (It's also usually a good idea to get powders[^powder].) Some of those people are helped; some have told me that they tried and the suggestion did little or nothing. I view nootropics as akin to a biological lottery; one good discovery pays for all. From my own perspective, melatonin & piracetam have paid for themselves and all the entries below; I forge on in the hopes of further striking gold in my unique biology. Your mileage will vary. All you have to do, all you can do is to [just try it](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5a5/no_seriously_just_try_it/).

[^powder]: With the more subtle nootropics, poor shopping can lead to the price per dose becoming so high that they are not cost-effective; this does not have to be the case. This tendency is exacerbated by general inefficiencies in the nootropics market - they are manufactured for vastly less than they sell for, although the margins aren't as high as they are in other supplement markets, and not nearly [as](http://www.economist.com/node/9414607?story_id=9414607) [comical](http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/economist-world-cocaine-prices.jpg) as illegal recreational drugs. (_Global Price Fixing: Our Customers are the Enemy_ (Connor 2001) briefly covers the vitamin cartel that operated for most of the 20th century, forcing food-grade vitamins prices up to well over 100x the manufacturing cost.) For example, the notorious Timothy Ferriss (_The Four-hour Work Week_) advises imitators to find a niche market with very high margins which they can insert themselves into as middlemen and reap the profits; one of his first businesses specialized in nootropics and bodybuilding. Or, when Smart Powders - usually one of the cheapest suppliers - was dumping its piracetam in a fire sale after the FDA warning, its owner mentioned on forums that it was still profiting (and that he didn't really care because selling to bodybuilders was *so* lucrative); this was because while SP was selling 2kg of piracetam for ~$90, Chinese suppliers were offering piracetam on [AliBaba](http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/343921293/Piracetam.html) for $30 a kilogram or a third of that in bulk. (Of course, you need to order in quantities like 30kg - this is more or less the only problem the middlemen retailers solve.) It goes without saying that premixed pills or products are even more expensive than the powders.

# Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

No effects, alone or mixed with choline+piracetam. This is pretty much as expected from reports about [ALCAR](!Wikipedia), but I had still been hoping for energy boosts or something. (Bought from Smart Powders.)

# Adderall

[Adderall](!Wikipedia) is a mix of 4 [amphetamine](!Wikipedia) salts; as such, like [caffeine](#caffeine), it is not strictly a nootropic but a cognitive enhancer. I ordered 10x10mg off [Silk Road]() ([Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Silk Road (anonymous marketplace)")). On the 4th day after confirmation from seller, the package arrived. It was a harmless looking little padded mailer. Adderall as promised, 10, blue, markings. in a double ziplock baggy (reasonable, it's not cocaine or anything). They matched pretty much exactly the descriptions of the generic I had found online. (Surprisingly, apparently both the brand name and the generic are manufactured by the same pharmacorp.)

I took the first pill at 12:48 pm. 1:18, still nothing really - head is a little foggy if anything. later noticed a steady sort of mental energy lasting for hours (got a good deal of reading and programming done) until my midnight walk, when I still felt alert, and had trouble sleeping. TODO Zeo data on how long I took to fall asleep

I had that evening also taken the 9 pills left, and used my pill maker to make 9 OO pills of piracetam mix, and then 9 OO pills of piracetam mix+the Adderall. Then I put them in a baggy. The idea being that I can blind myself as to what pill I am taking that day, and get a better idea of what the effects are. At the end of the day, I look in the baggy and see whether a placebo or Adderall pill is missing: the big capsules are transparent so I can see whether there is a crushed-up blue Adderall in the end or not. Now, since I am checking at the end of each day, I also need to remove or add the opposite pill to maintain the ratio, otherwise the odds will be skewed and I will know they are skewed. (Imagine I started with 4 Adderalls and 4 placebos, and then 3 days in a row I draw placebos but I don't add or remove any pills; obviously the next day, there's only a small chance I will get a placebo...) This is only one of many ways to do it; for example, instead of using one bag, one could use two bags and instead blindly pick a bag to take a pill out of, balancing contents as before.

Blackmarket Adderall is fairly expensive; $3-4 a pill vs prescription prices which run more like \$60 for 120 20mg pills. It would be a bad idea to become a fan without being quite sure that it is delivering bang for the buck. Now, why the piracetam mix as the placebo as opposed to my other available powder, creatine powder, which has much smaller mental effects? Because the question for me is not whether the Adderall works (I am quite sure that the amphetamines have effects!) but whether it works better for me than my cheap legal standbys (piracetam & caffeine). Hence, I want to know whether Adderall is *better than* my piracetam mix.

1. Began double-blind trial. Today I took one pill blindly at 1:53 PM. at the end of the day when I have written down my impressions and guess whether it was one of the Adderall pills, then I can look in the baggy and count and see whether it was. there are many other procedures one can take to blind oneself (have an accomplice mix up a sequence of pills and record what the sequence was; don't count & see but blindly take a photograph of the pill each day, etc.) Around 3, I begin to wonder whether it was Adderall because I am arguing more than usual on IRC and my heart rate seems a bit high just sitting down. 6 PM: I've started to think it was a placebo. My heart rate is back to normal, I am having difficulty concentrating on long text, and my appetite has shown up for dinner (although I didn't have lunch, I don't think I had lunch yesterday and yesterday the hunger didn't show up until past 7). Productivity wise, it has been a normal day. All in all, I'm not too sure, but I think I'd guess it was not Adderall with 60% confidence. When I go to examine the baggie at 8:20 PM, I find out... it was an Adderall pill after all. Oh dear. One little strike against Adderall that I guessed wrong. It may be that the problem is that I am intrinsically a little worse today (normal variation? come down from Adderall?). So, a change to the protocol. I will take a pill every other day - a day to washout and reacclimate to 'baseline', and then an experimental day.
2. Break day per previous rationale
3. Took random pill at 2:02 PM. Went to lunch half an hour afterwards, talked until 4 - more outgoing than my usual self. I continued to be pretty energetic despite not taking my caffeine+piracetam pills, and though it's now 12:30 AM and I listened to TAM YouTube videos all day while reading, I feel pretty energetic and am reviewing Mnemosyne cards. I am pretty confident the pill today was Adderall. Hard to believe placebo effect could do this much for this long or that normal variation would account for this. I'd say 90% confidence it was Adderall. I do some more Mnemosyne, typing practice, and reading in a Montaigne book, and finally get tired and go to bed around 1:30 AM or so. I check the baggie when I wake up the next morning, and sure enough, it had been an Adderall pill. That makes me 1 for 2.
4. Break day
5. Took pill 1:27 PM. At 2 my hunger gets the best of me (despite my usual tea drinking and caffeine+piracetam pills) and I eat a large lunch. This makes me suspicious it was placebo - on the previous days I had noted a considerable appetite-suppressant effect. 5:25 PM: I don't feel unusually tired, but nothing special about my productivity. 8 PM; no longer so sure. Read and excerpted a fair bit of research I had been putting off since the morning. After putting away all the laundry at 10, still feeling active, I check. It was Adderall. I can't claim this one either way. By 9 or 10 I had begun to wonder whether it was really Adderall, but I didn't feel confident saying it *was*; my feeling could be fairly described as 50%.
6. Break
7. Break; this day/night was for trying [armodafinil](#armodafinil), pill #1
8. Took pill around 6 PM; I had a very long drive to and from an airport ahead of me, ideal for Adderall. In case it was Adderall, I chewed up the pill - by making it absorb faster, more of the effect would be there when I needed it, during driving, and not lingering in my system past midnight. Was it? I didn't notice any change in my pulse, I yawned several times on the way back, my conversation was not more voluminous than usual. I did stay up later than usual, but that's fully explained by walking to get ice cream. All in all, my best guess was that the pill was placebo, and I feel fairly confident but not *hugely* confident that it was placebo. I'd give it ~70%. And checking the next morning... I was right! Finally.
9. Break
10. Took pill 12:11 PM. I am not certain. While I do get some things accomplished (a fair amount of work on the Silk Road article and its submission to places), I also have some difficulty reading through a fiction book (_Sum_) and I seem kind of twitchy and constantly shifting windows. I am weakly inclined to think this is Adderall (say, 60%). It's not my normal feeling. Next morning - it was Adderall.
11. Week-long break - armodafinil #2 experiment, volunteer work
12. Took pill #6 at 12:35 PM. Hard to be sure. I ultimately decided that it was Adderall because I didn't have as much trouble as I normally would in focusing on reading and then finishing my novel (_Surface Detail_) despite my family watching a movie, though I didn't notice any lack of appetite. Call this one 60-70% Adderall. I check the next evening and it was Adderall.
13. Break
14. Took pill at 10:50 AM. At 12:30 I watch the new _Captain America_[^capn], and come out as energetic as I went in and was not hungry for snacks at all during it; at this point, I'm pretty confident that it was Adderall. At 5 I check, and it was. Overall, pretty normal day, save for leading up to the third armodafinil trial.
15. Week-long break
16. Just 3 Adderall left; took random pill at 12:30. Hopefully I can get a lot of formatting done on [hafu](). I do manage to do a lot of work on it and my appetite seems minor up until 8 PM, although if not for those two observations; perhaps 60% that it was Adderall. I check the next morning, and it was *not*.
17. Skipping break day since it was placebo yesterday and I'd like to wind up the Adderall trials. Pill at 12:24 PM. I get very hungry around 3 PM, and it's an unproductive day even considering how much stress and aggravation and the 3 hours a failed Debian unstable upgrade cost me. I feel quite sure (75%) it was placebo. It was.
18. Took pill at 11:27 AM. Moderately productive. Not entirely sure. 50% either way. (It's placebo.)
19. Pill at 12:40 PM. I spend entirely too much time arguing matters related to a [LW post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/72f/why_epidemiology_will_not_correct_itself/) and on IRC, but I manage to channel it into writing a new mini-essay on [my past intellectual sins](Notes#things-i-have-changed-my-mind-about). This sort of thing seems like Adderall behavior, and I don't get hungry until much later. All in all, I feel easily 75% sure it's Adderall; and it was.
20. 12:18 PM. (There are/were just 2 Adderall left now.) I manage to spend almost the entire afternoon single-mindedly concentrating on transcribing two parts of a 1996 Toshio Okada interview (it was very long, and the formatting more challenging than expected), which is strong evidence for Adderall, although I did feel fairly hungry while doing it. I don't go to bed until midnight and & sleep very poorly - despite taking triple my usual melatonin! Inasmuch as I'm already fairly sure that Adderall damages my sleep, this makes me even more confident (>80%). When I grumpily crawl out of bed and check: it's Adderall. (One Adderall left.)

[^capn]: Much better than I had expected. One of the best superhero movies so far, better than _Thor_ or _Watchmen_ (and especially better than the _Iron Man_ movies). I especially appreciated how it didn't launch right into the usual hackneyed creation of the hero plot-line but made Captain America cool his heels performing & selling war bonds for 10 or 20 minutes. The ending left me a little nonplussed, although I sort of knew it was envisioned as a franchise and I would have to admit that showing Captain America wondering at Times Square is much better an ending than something as cliche as a close-up of his suddenly-opened eyes and then a fade out. (The movie continued the lamentable trend in superhero movies of having a strong female love interest... who only gets the hots for the hero *after* they get muscles or powers. It was particularly bad in _CA_ because she knows him and his heart of gold beforehand! What is the point of a feminist character who is immediately forced to do that?)

# Adrafinil

The [adrafinil](!Wikipedia)/Olmifon (bought simultaneously with the [hydergine](#hydergine) from Anti-Aging Systems, now [Antiaging Central](http://antiagingcentral.com/store/catalog/index.php?cPath=32)) was a disappointment. Almost as expensive as actual modafinil, with the risk of liver problems, but did nothing whatsoever that I noticed. It is supposed to be subtler than modafinil, but that's a little ridiculous.

# Aniracetam

Very expensive; I noticed minimal improvements when combined with sulbutiamine & piracetam+choline. Definitely not worthwhile for me.

# Beta-phenylethylamine (PEA)

Based on this [_H+_](http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/neuro/nutraceutical-brain-boosting-free-schwag) article/advertisement, I gave a [PEA](!Wikipedia "Phenethylamine") supplement a try. Noticed nothing. Critical commentators pointed out that PEA was notoriously degraded by the digestive system and has essentially no effect on its own[^phikal], though Neurvana's 'pro' supplement claimed to avoid that. I guess it doesn't.

[^phikal]: For example, [Alexander Shulgin](!Wikipedia)'s famous _[PiHKAL](!Wikipedia)_ book on derivatives of PEA [comments on PEA proper](http://pihkal.info/read.php?domain=pk&id=142) that:

    > - "(with 200, 400, 800 and 1600 mg) "No effects."
    > - (with 500 mg) "No effects."
    > - (with 800 and 1600 mg) "No effects."
    > - (with 25 and 50 mg i.v.) "No effects."
    >
    > ...It is without activity in man! Certainly not for the lack of trying, as some of the dosage trials that are tucked away in the literature (as abstracted in the "Qualitative Comments" given above) are pretty heavy duty. Actually, I truly doubt that all of the experimenters used exactly that phrase, "No effects," but it is patently obvious that no effects were found. It happened to be the phrase I had used in my own notes.
    >
    > ...Phenethylamine is intrinsically a stimulant, although it doesn't last long enough to express this property. In other words, it is rapidly and completely destroyed in the human body. It is only when a number of substituent groups are placed here or there on the molecule that this metabolic fate is avoided and pharmacological activity becomes apparent."

Discussions of PEA mention that it's almost useless without a [MAOI](!Wikipedia "Monoamine oxidase inhibitor") to [pave the way](!Wikipedia "Phenethylamine#Pharmacokinetics"); hence, when I decided to get [deprenyl](#selegiline-deprenyl) and noticed that deprenyl is a MAOI, I decided to also give PEA a second chance in conjunction with deprenyl. Unfortunately, in part due to my own shenanigans, Nubrain canceled the deprenyl order and so I have 20g of PEA sitting around. Well, it'll keep until such time as I *do* get a MAOI.

# Caffeine

I ordered 400g of 'anhydrous [caffeine](!Wikipedia)' from [Smart Powders](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5261-caffeine-anhydrous-400-grams.aspx). Apparently my [oolong tea](!Wikipedia) doesn't contain very much caffeine, so adding half a gram wakes me up a bit. Surprisingly for something with 'anhydrous' in its name, it doesn't seem to dissolve very well.

Caffeine is of course the most famous stimulant around. But consuming 0.5g or more a day, I have discovered the downside: it is addictive and has a nasty withdrawal - headaches, decreased motivation, apathy, and general unhappiness. Further, in some ways, caffeine is bad for mental performance, [anecdotally](http://quantifiedself.com/2009/10/the-false-god-of-coffee/) and [scientifically](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1w1/coffee_when_it_helps_when_it_hurts/):

1. [inhibits](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17400186) memory formation in the [hippocampus](!Wikipedia) (and [in](http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2065494) [mice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12424493) ([PDF](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjmbr/v35n10/4559.pdf)))
2. [slows](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15174922) memory retrieval for unprimed memories (although it speeds retrieval for related/primed memories)
3. higher doses [reduce performance](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-12/apa-im120210.php)
4. caffeine damages sleep (necessary for memory and alertness), even [6 hours before sleep](http://blog.myzeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Drake-et-al._Caffeine_2010_APSS-1.pdf)

This research is in considerable contrast to the other substances I like, such as piracetam or fish oil. I knew about withdrawal of course, but it was not so bad when I was drinking only tea. And the side-effects like jitteriness are worse on caffeine without tea; I chalk this up to the lack of [theanine](#theanine). (My later experiences with theanine seems to confirm this.) These negative effects mean that caffeine doesn't satisfy the strictest definition of 'nootropic' (having *no* negative effects), but is merely a 'cognitive enhancer' (with both benefits & costs). One might wonder why I use caffeine anyway if I am so concerned with mental ability. My answer is that this is not a lot of research or very good research (not nearly as good as the research on [nicotine](Nicotine#performance), eg.), and assuming it's true, I don't value [long-term memory](!Wikipedia) that much because LTM is something that is easily assisted or replaced (personal archives, and [spaced repetition]()). For me, my problems tend to be more about _akrasia_ and energy and not getting things done, so even if a stimulant comes with a little cost to long-term memory, it's still useful for me. I'm going continue to use the caffeine. It's not so bad in conjunction with tea, is very cheap, and I'm already addicted, so why not?

I ultimately mixed it in with the 3kg of piracetam and included it in that batch of pills. (I mixed it very thoroughly, one ingredient at a time, so I'm not very worried about 'hot spots'. But if you are, one clever way to get accurate caffeine measurements is to [measure out a large quantity & dissolve it](http://diysupplements.com/2011/02/add-caffeine-to-everything/) since it's easier to measure water than powder, and dissolving guarantees even distribution. This trick is applicable to anything else that dissolves nicely.)

# Choline

Does little alone, but absolutely necessary in conjunction with [piracetam](#piracetam). In the future, I might try Alpha-GPC instead of the regular cholines; that supposedly has better bio-availability. (Bought from Smart Powders.)

# Coconut oil

[Coconut oil](!Wikipedia) was recommended by Pontus Granström on the [Dual N-Back mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training) for boosting energy & mental clarity. It is fairly cheap (~$13 for 30 ounces) and tastes surprisingly good; it has a very bad reputation in some parts, but seems to be in the middle of a [rehabilitation](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/dining/02Appe.html). Seth Robert's [Buttermind experiment](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/29/the-buttermind-experiment/) found no mental benefits to coconut oil (and benefits to eating butter), but I wonder.

The first night I was eating some coconut oil, I did my n-backing past 11 PM; normally that damages my scores, but instead I got 66/66/75/88/77% on D4B and did not feel mentally exhausted by the end. The next day, I performed well on the [Cambridge](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) mental rotations test. An anecdote, of course, and it may be due to the [vitamin D](#vitamin-d) I simultaneously started. Or another day, I was slumped under apathy after a promising start to the day; a dose of fish & coconut oil, and 1 last vitamin D, and I was back to feeling chipper and optimist. Unfortunately I haven't been testing out coconut oil & vitamin D separately, so who knows which is to thank. But still interesting.

After several weeks of regularly consuming coconut oil and using up the first jar of 15oz, I'm no longer particularly convinced it was doing anything. (I've found it's pretty good for frying eggs, though.) Several days after using up the second jar, I notice no real difference in mood or energy or DNB scores.

# Creatine

[Creatine](!Wikipedia) monohydrate was another early essay of mine - cheap (because it's so popular with the bodybuilder types), and with a very good safety record. I bought some from Bulk Powders and combined it with my then-current regimen (piracetam+choline).

I'm not a bodybuilder, but my interest was sparked by several studies showing IQ boosts (such as [Rae 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691485/); however, Rae 2003 was only in vegetarians, who are known to be creatine deficient (much like B vitamins, creatine is usually gotten in one's diet from meat), and the other studies are likewise of subpopulations. [Rawson 2008](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T0P-4SHF4KD-5/2/c77ebd9c168b601c62ab0b3c36678689) studied young omnivores who are not stupid or sleep-deprived, and found no mental benefit. The summary of the [DNB ML discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fe4ee2f0c994e40e/d24bcf30c083ec3e) was that Rawson 2008 is a broad null result for healthy young omnivores who aren't idiots. Vegetarians, idiots, the sleep-deprived, and old people may benefit from creatine supplementation.

As I am not the latter, I didn't *really* expect a mental benefit. As it happens, I observed nothing. What surprised me was something I had forgotten about: its physical benefits. My performance in [Taekwondo](!Wikipedia) classes suddenly improved - specifically, my endurance increased substantially. Before, classes had left me nearly prostrate at the end, but after, I was weary yet fairly alert and happy. (I have done Taekwondo since I was 7, and I have a pretty good sense of what is and is not normal performance for my body. This was not anything as simple as failing to notice increasing fitness or something.) This was driven home to me one day when in a flurry before class, I prepared my customary tea with piracetam, choline & creatine; by the middle of the class, I was feeling faint & tired, had to take a break, and suddenly, thunderstruck, realized that I had absentmindedly forgot to actually drink it! This made me a believer.

After I ran out of creatine, I noticed the increased difficulty, and resolved to buy it again at some point; many months later, there was a sale so bought it in my batch order, $12 for [1000g](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5280-creatine-monohydrate-powder-1000-grams.aspx). As before, it made Taekwondo classes a bit easier. I paid closer attention this second time around and noticed that as one would expect, it only helped with muscular fatigue and did nothing for my aerobic issues.

# Fish oil

[Fish oil](!Wikipedia) provides benefits relating to general mood (eg. [inflammation](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110324153712.htm) & [anxiety](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21784145) ([PDF](http://www.nutrociencia.com.br/upload_files/artigos_download/Kiecolt-Glaser%20et%20al.,%202011.pdf))^[Psychiatrist [Emily Deans](http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/08/omega-3-inflammation-and-anxiety-in.html) has an overview of why this study is very nice; she also discusses why fish oil seems like a good idea from an [evolutionary perspective](http://www.psychologytoday.com/print/57150).]) and [anti](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/is-fish-oil-the-cure-for-schizophrenia-1157380.html)-[schizophrenia](http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/2/146); it is one of the better supplements one can take[^research]. (The known risks are a [higher rate of prostate cancer](http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2011/04/27/Omega-3-may-up-aggressive-prostate-cancer/UPI-31131303903320/) and internal bleeding, but are outweighed by the known cardiac benefits.) The benefits of omega acids seem to be real: I noticed an effect on [my dual n-back scores](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/78e54d222e2c268b/44526d276379dded).

The price is not as good as multivitamins or melatonin; I took 4 capsules a day for roughly 4000mg of omega acids. The jar of 400 is 100 days' worth, and costs ~$17, or around 17¢ a day. The general health benefits push me over the edge of favoring its indefinite use.

So I looked into what straight liquid would cost; unsurprisingly, they are much more cost-effective than pills (but like with the powders, straight fish oil isn't very appetizing) - I bought 4 bottles (16 fluid ounces each) for [$53.31](http://www.iherb.com/Nature-s-Answer-Liquid-Omega-3-Deep-Sea-Fish-Oil-EPA-DHA-Natural-Orange-Flavor-16-fl-oz-480-ml/7908) total (thanks to coupons & sales), and each bottle lasts around a month and a half for perhaps half a year, or ~$100 for a year's supply. (As it turned out, the 4 bottles lasted from 4 December 2010 to 17 June 2011, or 195 days.) Very reasonable indeed.

# Huperzine-A

My [experience report](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/6e35c60f904c2417):

One for the 'null hypothesis' files - Huperzine-A did nothing for me. Unlike piracetam or fish oil, after a full bottle^[[Source Naturals](http://www.amazon.com/Huperzine-A-200mcg-120-tabs/dp/B000WJH2HI/), 120 pills at 200mcg each], I noticed no side-effects, no mental improvements of any kind, and no changes in DNB scores from straight Huperzine-A.

Possible confounding factors:

- youth: I am considerably younger than the other poster who uses HA
- I only tested a few days with choline+H-A (but I didn't notice anything beyond the choline there).
- counterfeiting? Source Naturals is supposed to be trustworthy, but rare herbal products are most susceptible to fake goods.

It's really too bad. H-A is cheap, compact, doesn't taste at all, and in general is much easier to take than fish oil (and *much* easier to swallow than piracetam or choline!). But if it doesn't deliver, it doesn't deliver.

# Hydergine

[Hydergine](!Wikipedia) was another disappointment (like the [adrafinil](#adrafinil), purchased from Anti-Aging Systems/[Antiaging Central](http://antiagingcentral.com/store/catalog/index.php?cPath=29)). I noticed little to nothing that couldn't be normal daily variation.

# Lion's Mane mushroom

_[Hericium erinaceus](!Wikipedia)_ was recommended strongly by several on the [ImmInst.org](http://www.imminst.org/forum/) forums for its long-term benefits to learning, apparently linked to [Nerve growth factor](!Wikipedia). Highly speculative stuff, and it's unclear whether the mushroom powder I bought was the right form to take (ImmInst.org discussions seem to universally assume one is taking an alcohol or hotwater extract). It tasted nice, though, and I mixed it into my sleeping pills (which contain melatonin & tryptophan). I'll probably never know whether the $30 for 0.5lb was well-spent or not.

(I was more than a little nonplussed when the mushroom seller included a little pamphlet educating one about how papaya leaves can cure cancer, and how I'm shortening my life by decades by not eating many raw fruits & vegetables. There were some studies cited, but usually for points disconnected from any actual curing or longevity-inducing results. I also noticed that the author was a woman; which struck terror into my heart. What is it with women and alternative medicine? Women are greater consumers of alternative medicine according to [one survey](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad343.pdf) (by as much as 18%), and my subjective impressions has been formed by things like watching my chiropractor uncle go through a few hours of almost exclusively female patients. One wonders what is at play there. The perceived masculinity of modern medicine and men's general fear of biological issues? Perhaps a man goes to the doctor and does whatever surgery he is told; a woman gossips with her friends and listens to old wives' tales? If so, a lot of that could be explained as [social signaling](http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf) or social grooming. "Try this small inconvenient thing I told you! There, now our bonds are a little stronger.")

# Lithium

[Lithium](!Wikipedia) has a lot of interesting properties^[eg. see _Discover_'s ["The Metal Marvel That Has Mended Brains for 50 Years"](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/the-brain-2/27-metal-marvel-mended-brains-50-years-lithium/), or its connection to [DHA](!Wikipedia "Docosahexaenoic acid") and thus fish oil: ["How lithium works in the brain"](http://machineslikeus.com/news/how-lithium-works-brain). In mice, lithium [helps prevent](http://neurosciencenews.com/lithium-prevents-brain-damage-parkinsons-disease/) Parkinson's; although the lithium-Parkinson's research with its relatively low doses is a reminder to avoid lithium doses anywhere near what is used for psychiatric disorders: ["In at least two known cases, toxic levels of the drug have actually caused Parkinson's."](http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_18361882) But, in [one small human trial](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n5/abs/nbt.1837.html) (149 experimental, 447 total selected from >1000) on [PatientsLikeMe](!Wikipedia) investigating [a 2008 paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/6/2052.full)'s finding that lithium might delay ALS, only the null effect was found.] besides its famous effectiveness for manic-depression. [Lithium orotate](!Wikipedia) is sold commercially in low-doses; I purchased 200 pills with 5mg of lithium each. To put this dosage in comparison, the [therapeutic](!Wikipedia "Lithium pharmacology") doses of lithium are roughly 100x higher (around 500mg), while the natural drinking water levels - shown to [decrease crimes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699579) or [suicides](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/5/464) ([PDF](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/194/5/464.pdf)) or increase [longevity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21301855) ([PDF](http://www.springerlink.com/index/P3JP2013K4P5TQ3K.pdf)) - peak at ~0.5mg or >10x less. The pills are small and tasteless, and not at all hard to take.

Some suggested that the lithium would turn me into a 'zombie'. (There are serious negative effects to taking a lot of lithium - [2-4 grams will trash](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699579) your long-term memory. But at 5mg for 200 pills, I'd have to eat every one to get up to 1 gram, so I'm not worried about overdosing.) To test this, I took on day 1 & 2 no less than 4 pills or 20mg as a 'attack dose'; I didn't notice any significant change in emotional affect or energy levels. It may've helped my motivation, though I am also trying out the tyrosine.

Some weeks later, I'm still not sure. When I began putting all of my nootropic powders into pill-form, I put half a lithium pill in each, and nevertheless ran out of lithium fairly quickly (3kg of piracetam makes for >4000 OO-size pills); those capsules were buried at the bottom of the bucket under lithium-less pills. In effect, I suddenly went cold-turkey on lithium. Reflecting on the past 2 weeks, I seem to have been less optimistic and productive, with items lingering on my TODO list that I had been finding easier. An effect? Possibly. If I ever develop some good metrics for measuring general 'getting things done'-iveness, I should revisit lithium.

# Melatonin

See [Melatonin]().

# Modafinil

See [Modafinil]() for background.

Here are the notes I jotted down while trying out modafinil back in November 2009. I didn't make any effort to write sensibly, so this makes my lucidity seem much worse than it actually was:

Thursday: 3g piracetam/4g choline bitartate at 1; 1 200mg modafinil at 2:20; noticed a 'leveling' of fatigue by 3:30; dry eyes? no bad after taste or anything. a little light-headed by 4:30, but mentally clear and focused. wonder if light-headedness is due simply to missing lunch and not modafinil. 5:43: noticed my foot jiggling - doesn't usually jiggle while in piracetam/choline. 7:30: starting feeling a bit jittery & manic - not much or to a problematic level but definitely noticeable; but then, that often happens when I miss lunch & dinner. 12:30: bedtime. Can't sleep even with 3mg of melatonin! Subjectively, I toss & turn (in part thanks to my cat) until 4:30, when I really wake up. I hang around bed for another hour & then give up & get up. After a shower, I feel fairly normal, strangely, though not as good as if I had truly slept 8 hours. The lesson here is to pay attention to wikipedia when it says the half-life is 12-15 hours! About 6AM I take 200mg; all the way up to 2pm I feel increasingly less energetic and unfocused, though when I do apply myself I think as well as ever. Not fixed by food or tea or piracetam/choline. I want to be up until midnight, so I take half a pill of 100mg and chew it (since I'm not planning on staying up all night and I want it to work relatively soon). From 4-12PM, I notice that today as well my heart rate is elevated; I measure it a few times and it seems to average to ~70BPM, which is higher than normal, but not high enough to concern me. I stay up to midnight fine, take 3mg of melatonin at 12:30, and have no trouble sleeping; I think I fall asleep around 1. Alarm goes off at 6, I get up at 7:15 and take the other 100mg. Only 100mg/half-a-pill because I don't want to leave the half laying around in the open, and I'm curious whether 100mg + ~5 hours of sleep will be enough after the last 2 days. Maybe next weekend I'll just go without sleep entirely to see what my limits are.

In general, I feel a little bit less alert, but still close to normal. By 6PM, I have a mild headache, but I try out 30 rounds of gbrainy (haven't played it in months) and am surprised to find that I reach an all-time high; no idea whether this is due to DNB or not, since Gbrainy is very heavily 'crystallized' (half the challenge disappears as you learn how the problems work), but it does indicate I'm not deluding myself about mental ability. (To give a figure: my last score well before I did any DNB was 64, and I was doing well that day; on modafinil, I had a 77.) I figure the headache might be food related, eat, and by 7:30 the headache is pretty much gone and I'm fine up to midnight.

I took 1.5mg of melatonin, and went to bed at ~1:30AM; I woke up around 6:30, took a modafinil pill/200mg, and felt pretty reasonable. By noon my mind started to feel a bit fuzzy, and lunch didn't make much of it go away. I've been looking at studies, and users seem to degrade after 30 hours; I started on mid-Thursday, so call that 10 hours, then 24 (Friday), 24 (Saturday), and 14 (Sunday), totaling 72hrs with <20hrs sleep; this might be equivalent to 52hrs with no sleep, and [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Modafinil") writes:

> One study of helicopter pilots suggested that 600 mg of modafinil given in three doses can be used to keep pilots alert and maintain their accuracy at pre-deprivation levels for 40 hours without sleep.[60] However, significant levels of nausea and vertigo were observed. Another study of fighter pilots showed that modafinil given in three divided 100 mg doses sustained the flight control accuracy of sleep-deprived F-117 pilots to within about 27 percent of baseline levels for 37 hours, without any considerable side effects.[61] In an 88-hour sleep loss study of simulated military grounds operations, 400 mg/day doses were mildly helpful at maintaining alertness and performance of subjects compared to placebo, but the researchers concluded that this dose was not high enough to compensate for most of the effects of complete sleep loss.

If I stop tonight and do nothing Monday (and I sleep the normal eight hours and do not pay any penalty), then that'll be 4 out of 5 days on modafinil, each saving 3 or 4 hours. Each day took one pill which cost me $1.20, but each pill saved let's call it 3.5 hours; if I value my time at minimum wage, or 7.25/hr (federal minimum wage), then that 3.5 hours is worth $25.37, which is much more than $1.20, ~21x more.

My mental performance continues as before; curiously, I get an even higher score on Gbrainy, despite being sure I was less sharp than yesterday. Either I'm wrong about that, or Gbrainy is even more trainable than I thought. I go to bed Sunday around 1AM, and get up around 8AM (so call it 6 or 7 hours).

Monday: It's a long day ahead of me, so I take 200mg. Reasonable performance.

Tuesday: I went to bed at 1am, and first woke up at 6am, and I wrote down a dream; the lucid dreaming book I was reading advised that waking up in the morning and then going back for a short nap often causes lucid dreams, so I tried that - and wound up waking up at 10am with no dreams at all. Oops. I take a pill, but the whole day I don't feel so hot, although my conversation and arguments seem as cogent as ever. I'm also having a terrible time focusing on any actual work. At 8 I take another; I'm behind on too many things, and it looks like I need an all-nighter to catch up. The dose is no good; at 11, I still feel like at 8, possibly worse, and I take another along with the choline+piracetam (which makes a total of 600mg for the day). Come 12:30, and I disconsolately note that I don't seem any better, although I still seem to understand the IQ essays I am reading. I wonder if this is tolerance to modafinil, or perhaps sleep catching up to me? Possibly it's just that I don't remember what the quasi-light-headedness of modafinil felt like. I feel this sort of zombie-like state without change to 4am, so it must be doing something, when I give up and go to bed, getting up at 7:30 without too much trouble. Some N-backing at 9am gives me some low scores (24%,40%) but also some pretty high scores (71%,67%), which suggests I can perform normally if I concentrate. I take another pill and am fine the rest of the day, going to bed at 1am as usual.

Thursday: this is an important day where I really need to be awake. I'm up around 8, take a pill, and save one for later; I'll take half a pill at noon and the other half at 2. This works very well, and I don't feel tired well up to midnight, even though I spent an hour walking.

Friday: alarm clock woke me at 7:40, but I somehow managed to go back to sleep until 9:40. Perhaps sleep inertia is building up despite the modafinil. Another pill. I am in general noticing less effect, but I'll not take any this weekend to see whether I have simply gotten used to it.

Sat/Sun: bed at 1/2AM, awake at 10/11 respectively. Generally unmotivated.

Mon: went to bed at 11:30 Sun, woke at 7:30 and dozed to 8. 200mg at 8:30. No particular effect. Past this, I stop keeping notes. The main significant thing I notice is that my throat seems to be a little rough and my voice hoarser than usual.

(On a side note, I think I understand now why modafinil doesn't lead to a _[Beggars in Spain](!Wikipedia)_ scenario; BiS includes massive IQ and motivation boosts as part of the Sleepless modification. Just adding 8 hours a day doesn't do the world-changing trick, no more than some researchers living to 90 and others to 60 has lead to the former taking over. If everyone were suddenly granted the ability to never need sleep, many of them would have no idea what to do with the extra 8 or 9 hours and might well be destroyed by the gift; it takes a lot of motivation to make good use of the time, and if one cannot, then it is a curse akin to the stories of immortals who yearn for death - they yearn because life is not a blessing to them, though that is a fact more about them than life.)

## Armodafinil

[Armodafinil](!Wikipedia) is sort of a purified modafinil sold under the brand-name 'Nuvigil'; there are no generics of armodafinil because the Indian legal loophole only applied to the modafinil patents, not the armodafinil patents. Armodafinil acts much the same way but the modafinil variant filtered out are the [faster-acting](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12657914) [molecules](http://www.genemedrx.com/ArmodafinilR.pptx)[^pptx]. Hence, it is supposed to last longer; anecdotally, it's also more powerful, with Cephalon offering pills with doses as low as 50mg. (To be technical, modafinil is [racemic](!Wikipedia): it comes in two [forms](!Wikipedia "Isomer") which are rotations, mirror-images of each other. The rotation usually doesn't matter, but [sometimes](!Wikipedia "Enantiomer#Examples") it matters *tremendously* - for example, one form of [thalidomide](!Wikipedia "Thalidomide#Teratogenic mechanism") stops [morning sickness](!Wikipedia), and the other rotation causes [hideous birth defects](!Wikipedia "Thalidomide#Birth defects").)

Besides [Adderall](#adderall), I also purchased on [Silk Road]() 5x250mg pills of armodafinil. The price was extremely reasonable, 1.5btc or roughly $23 at that day's exchange rate; I attribute the low price to the seller being new and needing feedback, and offering a discount to induce buyers to take a risk on him. (Buyers bear a significant risk on Silk Road since sellers can easily physically anonymize themselves from their shipment, but intrinsically a buyer can be found just by following the package.) Because of the longer active-time, I resolved to test the armodafinil not during the day, but with an all-nighter.

1. First use

    Took full pill at 10:21 PM when I started feeling a bit tired. Around 11:30, I noticed my head feeling fuzzy but my reading seemed to still be up to snuff. I would eventually finish the science book around 9 AM the next day, taking some very long breaks to walk the dog, write some poems, write a program, do Mnemosyne review (memory performance: subjectively below average, but not as bad as I would have expected from staying up all night), and some other things. Around 4 AM, I reflected that I felt much as I had during my nightwatch job at the same hour of the day - except I had switched sleep schedules for the job. The tiredness continued to build and my willpower weakened so the morning wasn't as productive as it could have been - but my actual performance when I could be bothered was still pretty normal. That struck me as kind of interesting that I can *feel* very tired and not *act* tired, in line with the anecdotes.

    Past noon, I began to feel better, but since I would be driving to errands around 4 PM, I decided to not risk it and take an hour-long nap, which went well, as did the driving. The evening was normal enough that I forgot I had stayed up the previous night, and indeed, I didn't much feel like going to bed until past midnight. I then slept well, the [Zeo]() giving me a 108 ZQ (not an all-time record, but still unusual).
2. I had intended to run another Adderall trial this day but then I learned we would be going to the midnight showing of the last [_Harry Potter_](!Wikipedia "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2") movie. A perfect opportunity: going to bed at 3 AM after a stimulating battle movie would mean crappy sleep, so why not just do another armodafinil trial and kill 2 birds with one stone?

    I took the pill at 11 PM the evening of (technically, the day before); that day was a little low on sleep than usual, since I had woken up an hour or half-hour early. I didn't yawn at all during the movie (merely mediocre to my eyes with some questionable parts)[^potter]. It worked much the same as it did the previous time - as I walked around at 5 AM or so, I felt perfectly alert. I made good use of the hours and wrote up my memories of [ICON 2011]().

    (As I was doing this, I reflected how modafinil is such a pure example of the money-time tradeoff. It's not that you pay someone else to do something for you, which necessarily they will do in a way different from you; nor is it that you have exchanged money to free yourself of a burden of some future time-investment; nor have you paid money for a speculative return of time later in life like with many medical expenses or supplements. Rather, you have paid for 8 hours *today* of your own time.)

    And as before, around 9 AM I began to feel the peculiar feeling that I was mentally able and apathetic (in a sort of [aboulia](!Wikipedia) way); so I decided to try what helped last time, a short nap. But this time, though I took a full hour, I slept not a wink and my Zeo recorded only 2 transient episodes of light sleep! A back-handed sort of proof of alertness, I suppose. I didn't bother trying again. The rest of the day was mediocre, and I wound up spending much of it on chores and whatnot out of my control. Mentally, I felt better past 3 PM.

    This continued up to 1 AM, at which point I decided not to take a second armodafinil (why spend a second pill to gain what would likely be an unproductive set of 8 hours?) and finish up the experiment with some n-backing. My 5 rounds: 60/38/62/44/50[^settings]. This was surprising. Compare those scores with scores from several previous days: 39/42/44/40/20/28/36. I had estimated before the n-backing that my scores would be in the low-end of my usual performance (20-30%) since I had not slept for the past 41 hours, and instead, the *lowest* score was 38%. If one did not know the context, one might think I had discovered a good nootropic! Interesting evidence that armodafinil preserves at least one kind of mental performance.
3. I stayed up late writing some [poems](Genshiken) and about how Folding@home kills, and decided to make a night of it. I took the armodafinil at 1 AM; the interesting bit is that this was the morning/evening after what turned out to be an Adderall (as opposed to placebo) trial, so perhaps I will see how well or ill they go together. A set of normal scores from a previous day was 32%/43%/51%/48%. At 11 PM, I scored 39% on DNB; at 1 AM, I scored 50%/43%; 5:15 AM, 39%/37%; 4:10 PM, 42%/40%; 11 PM, 55%/21%/38%.

    The peculiar tired-sharp feeling was there as usual, and the DNB scores continue to suggest this is not an illusion, as they remain in the same 30-50% band as my normal performance. I did not notice the previous 'aboulia' feeling; instead, around noon, I was filled with a nervous energy and a disturbingly rapid pulse which meditation & deep breathing did little to help with. I have no idea what that was about. I wondered if it might've been a [serotonin storm](!Wikipedia) since amphetamines are some of the drugs that can trigger storms but the Adderall had been at 10:50 AM the previous day, or >25 hours (the half-lives of the ingredients being around 13 hours). An hour or two previously I had taken my usual caffeine-piracetam pill with my morning tea - could that have interacted with the armodafinil and the residual Adderall? Speculation, perhaps. A house-mate was ill for a few hours the previous day, so maybe the truth is as prosaic as me catching whatever he had.
4. Stayed up with the purpose of finishing my work for a [contest](http://lesswrong.com/lw/69p/prize_new_contest_for_spaced_repetition/). This time, instead of taking the pill as a single large dose (I feel that after 3 times, I understand what it's like), I will take 4 doses over the new day. I took the first quarter at 1 AM, when I was starting to feel a little foggy but not significantly impaired. Second dose, 5:30 AM; feeling a little impaired. 8:20 AM, third dose; as usual, I feel physically a bit off and mentally tired - but still mentally sharp when I actually do something. Early on, my heart rate seemed a bit high and my limbs trembling, but it's pretty clear now that that was the caffeine or piracetam. It may be that the other day, it was the caffeine's fault as I suspected. The final dose was around noon. The afternoon 'crash' wasn't so pronounced this time, although motivation remains a problem. I put everything into finishing up the [spaced repetition literature review](Spaced repetition#literature-review), and didn't do any n-backing until 11:30 PM: 32/34/31/54/40%.

[^potter]: Specifically, the film is completely unintelligible if you had not read the book. The best I can say for it is that it delivers the action and events one expects in the right order and with basic competence, but its artistic merits are few. It seems generally devoid of the imagination and visual flights of fancy that animated movies 1 and 3 especially (although [Mike Darwin disagrees](http://chronopause.com/index.php/2011/07/15/902/)), copping out on standard imagery like a _Star Wars_-style force field over Hogwarts Castle, or luminescent white fog when Harry was dead and in his head; I was deeply disappointed to not see any sights that struck me as novel and new. (For example, the aforementioned dead scene could have been done in so many interesting ways, like why not show Harry & Dumbledore in a bustling King's Cross shot in bright sharp detail, but with not a single person in sight and all the luggage and equipment animatedly moving purposefully on their own?) The ending in particular boggles me. I actually turned to the person next to me and asked them whether that really was the climax and Voldemort was dead, his death was so little dwelt upon or laden with significance (despite a musical score that beat you over the head about *everything else*). In the book, I remember it feeling like a climactic scene, with everyone watching and little speeches explaining why Voldemort was about to be defeated, and a suitable victory celebration; I read in the paper the next day a quote from the director or screenwriter who said one scene was cut because Voldemort would not talk but simply try to efficiently kill Harry. (This is presumably the explanation for the incredible *anti*-climax. Hopefully.) I was dumbfounded by the depths of dishonesty or delusion or disregard: Voldemort not only does that in _Deathly Hallows_ multiple times, he does it *every time* he deals with Harry, exactly as the classic villains (he is numbered among) always do! How was it possible for this man to read the books many times, as he must have, and still say such a thing?

# Nicotine

Following up on my little [investigation into performance & health benefits](Nicotine) of [nicotine](!Wikipedia), I ordered the most cost-effective batch of chewing gum I could find on Amazon (100 Nicorette 4mg); and the seller canceled on me! Poor show, Direct Super center, very poor show. I will try again the next time I order anything off Amazon; I'm not in a hurry.

# Oxiracetam

[Oxiracetam](!Wikipedia) is one of the 3 most popular -racetams; less popular than piracetam but seems to be more popular than aniracetam. Prices have come down significantly since the early 2000s, and stand at around [1.2g/$](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5342-oxiracetam-powder.aspx) or roughly 50 cents a dose, which was low enough to experiment with; key question, does it stack with piracetam or is it redundant for me? (Oxiracetam can't compete on price with my piracetam pile stockpile.)

I bought 60 grams from Smart Powders (as usual) and combined it with the DMAE; I couldn't compare oxiracetam+DMAE vs oxiracetam+choline-bitrate because I had capped all the choline with the piracetam. One immediate advantage of oxiracetam: it is not unbelievably foul tasting like piracetam, but slightly sweet.

Regardless, while in the absence of piracetam, I did notice some stimulant effects (somewhat negative - more aggressive than usual while driving) and similar effects to piracetam, I did *not* notice any mental performance beyond piracetam when using them both. The most I can say is that on some nights, I seemed to be less easily tired when writing or editing or n-backing (see below <!-- or TODO my [ICON 2011]() notes -->), but those were nights I was *also* trying out all the other things I had gotten in that order from Smart Powders, and I am still dis-entangling what was responsible. (Probably the [l-theanine](#theanine) or [sulbutiamine](#sulbutiamine).)

In other words, for me they did not seem to 'stack'. The following are a number of n-back scores from before (piracetam only) and after (piracetam and oxiracetam), grouped by day:

    [28,39,26,48,34]
    [34,60]
    [37,53,55]
    # started oxiracetam
    [56,66,44,46,30,24,50,56,34,39,34]
    [30,50,31,37,41,23]
    [53,35,40]

Oxiracetam has smaller recommended doses than piracetam, but is still more expensive. I will continue to

# Piracetam

So as you may remember, I bought 500g of [piracetam](!Wikipedia) from Smart Powders (piracetam is one of the cheapest nootropics and SP one of the cheapest suppliers; the others are [much more expensive](http://users4.jabry.com/isochroma/Racetam%20Prices.htm)), and I've tried it out for several days (started on 7 September 2009, and used it steadily up to mid-December). I've varied my dose from 3 grams to 12 grams (at least, I think the little scoop measures in grams), taking them in my tea or bitter fruit juice. Cranberry worked the best, although orange juice masks the taste pretty well; I also accidentally learned that piracetam stings horribly when I got some on a cat scratch. 3 grams (alone) didn't seem to do much of anything while 12 grams gave me a nasty headache. I also ate 2 or 3 eggs a day.

Subjectively, I don't notice drastic changes. Here's what I do notice:

- My thinking seems a little clearer
- I'm not so easy to tire - I went through a month's worth of my Wikipedia watchlist with less fatigue than usual, and n-backing doesn't seem so tiring.
- [DNB](DNB FAQ)-wise, eyeballing my stats file seems to indicate a small increase: when I compare peak scores D4B scores, I see mostly 50s and a few 60s before piracetam, and after starting piracetam, a few 70s mixed into the 50s and 60s. Natural increase from training? Dunno - I've been stuck on D4B since June, so 5 or 10% in a week or 3 seems a little suspicious. The full list of scores from then to now is:

- The other day, I also noticed I was fidgeting less
- After a week or two, I *think* I noticed better reflexes - both in catching falling cups and the [saccading](!Wikipedia "Saccade") in BW seems slightly easier. But I could be imagining this since I just saw an Erowid report mentioning better reflexes & I may've read that one before I started. (Darn those subconscious impressions and memories! :)

After 7 days, I ordered a kg of [choline](!Wikipedia) bitartate from <http://www.bulkpowders.com>. Choline is standard among piracetam-users because it is pretty universally supported by anecdotes about "piracetam headaches", has strong support in [rat/mice experiments](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0197458081900075)^[That study is also interesting for finding benefits to chronic piracetam+choline supplementation in the mice, which seems connected to a [Russian study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20095391) which found that piracetam (among other more obscure nootropics) increased secretion of [BDNF](!Wikipedia "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor") in mice.] See also [Drug heuristics](Drug heuristics#piracetam) on a study involving choline supplementation in pregnant rats.], and also some [human-related research](!Wikipedia "Piracetam#Side effects"). So I figured I couldn't fairly test piracetam without some regular choline - the eggs might not be enough, might be the wrong kind, etc. It has a quite distinctly fishy smell, but the actual taste is more citrus-y, and it seems to neutralize the piracetam taste in tea (which makes things much easier for me).

The first day (22 September) I took ~10g since I was taking 5g of piracetam; I wound up with some diarrhea & farting. Oops.

On the plus side:
- I noticed the less-fatigue thing to a greater extent, getting out of my classes much less tired than usual. (Caveat: my sleep schedule recently changed for the saner recently, so it's possible that's responsible. I think it's more the piracetam+choline, though.)
- One thing I wasn't expecting was a decrease in my appetite - nobody had mentioned that in their reports.I don't like being bothered by my appetite (I know how to eat fine without it reminding me), so I count this as a plus.
- Fidgeting was reduced further

The second day I went with ~6g of choline; much less intestinal distress, but similar effects vis-a-vis fidgeting, loss of appetite, & reduced fatigue.

So in general I thought this was a positive experience, but I'm not sure it was worth $40 for ~2 months' worth, and it was tedious consuming it.

# Selegiline / Deprenyl

[Selegiline](!Wikipedia) (also known as Deprenyl) is a somewhat popular ([Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Selegeline.shtml), [r/nootropics](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/search?q=selegiline+OR+deprenyl&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance)) stimulant/anti-depressant which affects dopamine.

Dosage is apparently 5-10mg a day, so presumably that's ~60 days. (Prices can be better elsewhere; selegiline is popular for treating dogs with senile dementia, where those 60x5mg will cost [$_2_](http://www.petcarerx.com/pcrx/ProductPages/Product.aspx?pid=10983) rather than $35[^economics]. One needs a veterinarian's prescription to purchase from pet-oriented online pharmacies, though.) I ordered it & modafinil from [Nubrain.com](http://www.nubrain.com/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=12) at \$35 for 60x5mg; Nubrain delayed and eventually canceled my order - and my enthusiasm. Between that and realizing how much of a premium I was paying for Nubrain's deprenyl, I'm tabling deprenyl along with nicotine & modafinil for now. Which is too bad, because I had even ordered 20g of [PEA](#beta-phenylethylamine-pea) from Smart Powders to try out with the deprenyl. (My later attempt to order some off the Silk Road also failed when the seller canceled the order.)

[^economics]: One might expect some sort of catch - surely there's a massive quality difference to go with the massive price difference? But there could well not be; I would not be surprised to learn that the dog selegiline and the human selegiline came out of the same vat.

    It's basic economics: the price of a good must be greater than cost of producing said good, but only under [perfect competition](!Wikipedia) will price = cost. Otherwise, the price is simply whatever maximizes profit for the seller. (Bottled water doesn't *really* cost $2 to produce.) This can lead to apparently counter-intuitive consequences involving [price discrimination](!Wikipedia) & [market segmentation](!Wikipedia) - such as ['damaged' goods](!Wikipedia "Damaged good#Computer hardware") which are the premium product which has been deliberately degraded and sold for less (some [Intel](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/18/intel-wants-to-charge-50-to-unlock-stuff-your-cpu-can-already-d/) CPUs, some [headphones](http://mikebeauchamp.com/misc/sennheiser-hd-555-to-hd-595-mod/) etc.). The most famous examples were railroads; one notable passage by French engineer-economist Jules Dupuit describes the motivation for the conditions in 1849:

    > "It is not because of the few thousand francs which would have to be spent to put a roof [!] over the third-class carriages or to upholster the third-class seats that some company or other has open carriages with wooden benches. What the company is trying to do is to prevent the passengers who can pay the second class fare from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to hurt them, but to frighten the rich. And it is again for the same reason that the companies, having proved almost cruel to the third-class passengers and mean to the second-class ones, become lavish in dealing with first-class passengers. Having refused the poor what is necessary, they give the rich what is superfluous."

    Price discrimination is aided by barriers such as oligopolies, which there clearly is in the case of using veterinary drugs on humans - any doctor to do so would probably be guilty of medical malpractice or similar charges. Similarly, we can predict that whenever there is a veterinary drug which is chemically identical to a human drug, the veterinary drug will be much cheaper than the human drug because pet owners do not value their pets more than themselves. Human drugs are ostensibly held to a higher standard than veterinary drugs; so if veterinary prices are *higher*, then there will be an arbitrage incentive to simply buy the cheaper human version and 'downgrade' them to veterinary drugs.

    As with any thesis, there are exceptions to this general practice. For example, [theanine](#theanine) for dogs is sold under the brand Anxitane is sold at almost a dollar a pill, and apparently a month's supply costs [$50+ vs $13 for human-branded theanine](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/f4skp/ltheanine_a_natural_nutraceutical_my_vet_just/); on the other hand, this thesis predicts 'downgrading' if the market priced pet versions higher than human versions, and that Reddit poster appears to be doing just that with her dog.

# Sulbutiamine

[2 experiences](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/an862/whos_had_experience_with_sulbutiamine/) with [sulbutiamine](!Wikipedia) on Reddit.

My general impression is positive; it does seem to help with endurance and extended the effect of piracetam+choline, but is not as effective as that combo. At $20 for 30g (bought from Smart Powders), I'm not sure it's worthwhile, but I think at $10-15 it would probably be worthwhile. Sulbutiamine seems to affect my sleep negatively, like caffeine. I bought 2 or 3 canisters for my third batch of pills along with the theanine. For a few nights in a row, I slept terribly and stayed awake thinking until the wee hours of the morning; eventually I realized it was because I was taking the theanine pills along with the sleep-mix pills, and the only ingredient that was a stimulant in the batch was - sulbutiamine. I cut out the theanine pills at night, and my sleep went back to normal. (While very annoying, this, like the creatine & taekwondo example, does tend to prove to me that sulbutiamine was doing *something* and it is not pure placebo effect.)

It's worth noting that sulbutiamine reports vary dramatically, and it seems possible that some people are thiamine-deficient and so would disproportionately; [SilasBarta](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2q0/intelligence_amplification_open_thread/2mv4?c=1) noticed little to nothing (like me), but [Jimrandomh](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2kl/open_thread_august_2010_part_2/2j0z?c=1) reports his life was transformed (and he suspects that his diabetes caused or exacerbated a deficiency).

# Taurine

[Taurine](!Wikipedia) was another gamble on my part, based mostly on its inclusion in energy drinks. I didn't do as much research as I should have: it came as a shock to me when I read in [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Taurine#Physiological functions") that "taurine has been shown to prevent oxidative stress induced by exercise" and was an antioxidant - oxidative stress is a key part of how exercise creates health benefits and antioxidants [*inhibit*](!Wikipedia "Antioxidant#Physical exercise") those benefits.

So now I have to be careful about when I take it so it isn't near a session of exercise or just accept whatever damage taurine does me. I'm not sure what I'll do with it when I cap my current supply of powders. (It would make little sense to cap it with the [creatine](#creatine) since I would often take the creatine before exercise.)

And the effects? Well, if you look through the WP article or other places, you see it justified in part due to supposed long term benefits or effects on [blood sugar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14992273). I can't say I've noticed any absence of 'crashes', taking it on alternate days or alone. (At least it wasn't too expensive - [$9 for 500g](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5356-taurine-powder-500-grams.aspx).)

# Theanine

[Theanine](!Wikipedia) is occasionally mentioned on Reddit or Imminst or LessWrong[^lwtheanine] but is rarely a top-level post or article; this is probably because theanine was discovered a very long time ago (>61 years ago), and it's a pretty straightforward substance. It's a weak relaxant/[anxiolytic](!Wikipedia)^[If you don't like Wikipedia's citations on this, see also [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=theanine+anxiety).] which is probably responsible for a number of the [health benefits](!Wikipedia "Health effects of tea") of tea, and [which](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079786) [works](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21040626) [synergistically](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988) with [caffeine](#caffeine) (and is probably why caffeine delivered through coffee feels different from the same amount consumed in tea - in one study, separate caffeine and theanine were a mixed bag, but the combination [beat placebo on all measurements](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006208)).

[^lwtheanine]: See for example the mentions in ["A rationalist's guide to psychoactive drugs"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/45u/a_rationalists_guide_to_psychoactive_drugs/) or the discussion in the post ["Coffee: When it helps, when it hurts"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1w1/coffee_when_it_helps_when_it_hurts/1qiu); see also the description of a rare [*bad* experience](http://lesswrong.com/lw/20w/open_thread_april_2010/1ubp) with theanine.

I purchased from Smart Powders ([20g for $7](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5327-l-theanine-powder-20-grams.aspx)); as before, some light searching seemed to turn up SP as the best seller given shipping overhead. It was on sale and I planned to cap it so I got 80g. This may seem like a lot, but I was highly confident that theanine and I would get along since I already drink so much tea and was a tad annoyed at the edge I got with straight caffeine. So far I'm pretty happy with it. My goal was to eliminate the physical & mental 'twitchiness' of caffeine, which it seems to do.

# Tryptophan

l-[Tryptophan](!Wikipedia) is in a sense redundant with taking [melatonin](#Melatonin), since melatonin is one of the most prominent metabolites of tryptophan. Nevertheless, subjectively I seem to sleep better by taking 1.5mg of melatonin & 0.5g of tryptophan than I do by taking, say, 3mg of melatonin.

One of the other suggested benefits is for boosting serotonin levels; low levels of serotonin are implicated in a number of issues like depression. I'm not yet sure whether tryptophan has helped with motivation or happiness. Trial and error has taught me that it's a bad idea to take tryptophan in the morning or afternoon, however, even smaller quantities like 0.25g. Like melatonin, the dose-response curve is a U: ~1g is great and induces multiple vivid dreams for me, but ~1.5g leads to an awful night and a headache the next day that was worse, if anything, than melatonin. (One morning I woke up with traces of at least 7 dreams, although I managed to write down only 2. No lucid dreams, though.)

Taking the tryptophan is fairly difficult. The powder as supplied by Bulk Nutrition is *extraordinarily* dry and fine; it seems to be positively [hydrophobic](!Wikipedia). The first time I tried to swallow a teaspoon, I nearly coughed it out - the power had seemed to explode in my mouth and go down my lungs. Thenceforth I made sure to have a mouth of water first. After a while, I took a different tack: I mixed in as much [_Hericium_](#lions-mane-mushroom) as would fit in the container. The mushroom powder is wetter and chunkier than the tryptophan, and seems to reduce the problem. Combining the mix with chunks of melatonin inside a pill works even better.

# Tyrosine

[Tyrosine](!Wikipedia) is an amino acid; people on the Imminst.org forums (as well as Wikipedia) suggest that it helps with energy and coping with stress. I ordered 4oz  (bought from Smart Powders) to try it out, and I began taking 1g with my usual caffeine+piracetam+choline mix. It does not dissolve easily in hot water, and is very chalky and not especially tasty. I have not noticed any particular effects from it.

# Vitamin D

Bought 5,000 IU soft-gels of [Vitamin D](!Wikipedia)-3 because I was feeling very apathetic in January 2011 and not getting much done, even slacking on regular habits like [Mnemosyne spaced repetition review](Spaced repetition) or [dual n-back](DNB FAQ) or my [Wikipedia watchlist](!Wikipedia "Help:Watching pages"). Introspecting, I  was reminded of depression & [dysthymia](!Wikipedia) & [seasonal affective disorder](!Wikipedia). There are a number of treatments for the last. I already use melatonin. I sort of have [light therapy](!Wikipedia) from a [full-spectrum](!Wikipedia "Full-spectrum light") fluorescent desk lamp. But I get very little sunlight; the surprising thing would be if I *didn't* have a vitamin D deficiency. (And vitamin D deficiencies have been linked with all sorts of interesting things like near-sightedness, with [time outdoors](http://bjo.bmj.com/content/93/8/997) inversely correlating with myopia and *not* reading or near-work time.)

The soft gels are very small; one needs to be a bit careful - [overdose starts](!Wikipedia "Hypervitaminosis D") in the range of 70,000 IU, so 14 pills would be enough, and it's unclear where problems start with chronic use^[Vitamin D, like many supplements, [follows](http://www.ajcn.org/content/69/5/842.full) [a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19444937) [U-shaped](http://www.ajcn.org/content/early/2010/08/18/ajcn.2010.29749.abstract) [response curve](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2010/03/03/jn.109.119636.abstract) - too much can be quite as bad as too little. Too little, though, can be [very bad](http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2009/jan2009_Millions-of-Needless-Deaths_01.htm).]. 10,000 IU is probably more than enough and is similar to what one might get from an hour on the beach.

# TODO

- [Bacopa](!Wikipedia "Bacopa monnieri#Medicine") - The research looks interesting and it's [cheap](http://www.smartpowders.com/p-5255-bacopa-monnieri-20-powder-75-grams.aspx); but I am suspicious of anything [Ayurvedic](!Wikipedia "Ayurveda#Safety") because of heavy metals, and _Bacopa monnieri_ is a [hyperaccumulator](!Wikipedia "Bacopa monnieri#Phytoremediation") of heavy metals.
- [Naringenin](!Wikipedia) - Timothy Ferriss in excerpt from _Four-hour Body_ claims it extends effectiveness of caffeine (how to buy - capsule? grape fruit concentrate?)

# 3 years supply in pill form

Powders are too annoying, and pills expensive in bulk. So since I'm making my own pills, I might as well make a custom formulation using the ones I've found personally effective. And since making pills is tedious, I want to not have to do it again for years. 3 years seems like a good interval - 1095 days. Since one is often busy and mayn't take that day's pills (there are enough ingredients it has to be multiple pills), it's safe to round it down to a nice even 1000 days.

So, we omit tryptophan because it seems most useful for sleeping and this is a stimulus pill meant for daytime usage. That leaves from the above the following, with some basic commercial specs from the usual retailers:

We calculate how many days each unit gets us simply by dose divided by dose per day. We get quite a range; with some products, we only need 4 units to cover at least 1000 days, but we need 100 units for modafinil!

Ingredient        Units   Cost
----------------  -----   ----
aniracetam        6       $300
caffeine          5       $90
choline citrate   4       $68
creatine          4       $68
lithium orotate   8       $88
modafinil         100     $800
sulbutiamine      9       $180
theanine          5       $50

Sum total, $1644, or $1.65 per day for the ingredients.

But how many pills does this make and how much do those pills cost?

[Capsule Connection](http://www.capsuleconnection.com/) sells 1000 00 pills (the largest pills) for $9. I already have a pill machine, so that doesn't count (a sunk cost). If we sum the grams per day column from the first table, we get 9.75 grams a day. Each 00 pill can take around 0.75 grams, so we need 13 pills. (Creatine is very bulky, alas.) 13 pills per day for 1000 days is 13,000 pills, and 1,000 pills is $9 so we need 13 units and 13 times 9 is $117.

Redoing the above, the total expense is $1761 or $1.76 per day.

13 pills a day sounds like a lot, and $1.76 is actually a fair amount per day compared to what most people take. If I couldn't swing a round $1800 (even to cover years of consumption), how would I economize?

Looking at the prices, the overwhelming expense is for modafinil. It's a powerful stimulant - possibly the single most effective ingredient in the list - but dang expensive. If we drop it, the cost drops by a full $800 from $1761 to $961 (almost halving) and to $0.96 per day. A remarkable difference, and if one were genetically insensitive to modafinil, one would definitely want to remove it.

On the other metric, suppose we removed the creatine? Dropping 4 grams of material means we only need to consume 5.75 grams a day, covered by 8 pills (compared to 13 pills). We save 5,000 pills, which would have cost $45 and also don't spend the $68 for the creatine; assuming a modafinil formulation, that drops our $1761 down to $1648 or $1.65 a day. Or we could remove both the creatine and modafinil, for a grand total of $848 or $0.85 a day.
