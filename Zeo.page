So on Christmas I finally got a [Zeo](!Wikipedia "Zeo, Inc."). A Zeo is basically an alarm clock with a wireless scaled-down [EEG](!Wikipedia) sensor-headband. The EEG data is processed to estimate whether one is asleep and what [stage](!Wikipedia "Sleep#Sleep stages") of sleep one is in. Zeo breaks sleep down into waking, [REM](!Wikipedia "Rapid eye movement sleep"), [light](!Wikipedia "Non-rapid eye movement sleep"), and [deep](!Wikipedia "Slow-wave sleep"). (The phases aren't necessarily that physiologically distinct.)

The data is much better than what you would get from more popular methods like cellphones with accelerometers, since an accelerometer only knows if you are moving or not, which isn't a very reliable indicator of sleep. (You could just be lying there staring at the ceiling, wide awake. Or perhaps the cat is kneading you while you are in light sleep.) As well, half the interest is how exactly sleep phases are arranged and how long the cycles are; you could use that information to devise [a custom polyphasic schedule](http://blog.myzeo.com/sleeping-round-the-clock-a-polyphasic-experiment/) or just figure out a better nap length than the rule-of-thumb of 20 minutes.

# Tests

I personally want the data for a few distinct purposes:

1. quantifying the benefits of [melatonin](Melatonin)
2. quantifying the benefits of [modafinil](Modafinil)
3. testing benefits of [huperzine-A](!Wikipedia)[^ferriss]
4. designing & starting [polyphasic sleep](!Wikipedia)
5. assisting [lucid dreaming](!Wikipedia)
6. reducing sleep time in general (better & less sleep)
7. investigating effects of [n-backing](DNB FAQ):

    - do n-backing just before sleep, and see whether percentages shift (more deep sleep as the brain grows/changes?) or whether one sleeps better (fewer awakenings, less light sleep).
    - do n-backing after waking up, to look for correlation between good/bad sleeps and performance (one would expect good sleep ~> good scores).
    - test the costs of polyphasic sleep on memory^[My own suspicion is that given the existence of [neuron-level sleep in mice](http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/4264/can-we-be-awake-and-asleep-same-time), [poor self-monitoring in humans](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sleep-t.html), and [anecdotal reports](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5n0/optimizing_sleep/44zu) about polyphasic sleep, is that polyphasic sleep is a real & workable phenomenon but that it comes at the price of a significant chunk of mental performance.]
8. effect of [Seth Roberts](!Wikipedia)'s [one-legged standing](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/) on sleep depth/efficiency

[^ferriss]: I had previously [tried](Nootropics#huperzine-a) huperzine-A and found no effect from it, but I had no way of really noticing any effect on sleep, and [Timothy Ferriss](!Wikipedia) in his _The Four-hour Body_ claims:

    > "Taking 200 milligrams of huperzine-A 30 minutes before bed can increase total REM by 20 â€“30%. Huperzine-A, an extract of _Huperzia serrata_, slows the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is a popular nootropic (smart drug), and I have used it in the past to accelerate learning and increase the incidence of lucid dreaming. I now only use huperzine-A for the first few weeks of language acquisition, and no more than three days per week to avoid side effects. Ironically, one documented side effect of overuse is insomnia. The brain is a sensitive instrument, and while generally well tolerated, this drug is contraindicated with some classes of medications. Speak with your doctor before using."

# First impressions
## First night

Christmas morning, I unpacked it and admired the packaging, and then looked through the manual. The base-station/alarm-clock seems pretty sturdy and has a large clear screen. The headband seemed comfortable enough that it wouldn't bother me. The various writings with it seemed rather fluffy and preppy, but I did my technical homework before hand, so could ignore their crap.

Late that night (quite late, since the girls stayed up playing _[Fable 3](!Wikipedia)_ and Xbox [Kinect](!Wikipedia) dancing games and what not), I turn in wearily. I had noticed that the alarm seemed to be set for ~3:30 AM, but I was very tired from the long day and taking my melatonin, and didn't investigate further - I mean, what electronic would ship with the alarm both enabled and enabled for a bizarre time? It wasn't worth bothering the other sleeper by turning on the light and messing with it. I put on the headband, verified that the Zeo seemed to be doing stuff, and turned in.

Come 3 AM, and the damn music goes off! I hit snooze, too discombobulated to figure out how to turn off the alarm.

So that explains the strange Zeo data for the first day:

![First night](/images/zeo/2010-12-25.png)

The major surprise in this data was how quickly I fell asleep: 18 minutes. I had always thought that I took much longer to fall asleep, more like 45 minutes, and had budgeted accordingly; but apparently [being deluded](http://blog.myzeo.com/sleep-forgetting-to-remember-to-forget/) about when you are awake and asleep is common. The rest of the data seemed too messed up by the alarm to learn anything from.

# Uses
## Meditation

One possible application for Zeo was meditation. If it's measuring via EEG, then presumably it's learning something about how relaxed and activity-less one's mind is. I'm not seeking enlightenment, just calmness, which would seem to be in the purview of an EEG signal. (As Charles Babbage said. errors made using insufficient data are still less than errors made using no data at all.) But alas, I meditated for a solid 25 minutes and the Zeo stubbornly read at the same wake level the entire time; I then read my [Donald Keene](!Wikipedia) book, _Modern Japanese diaries_, for a similar period with no change at all. It is possible that the 5-minute averaging (Zeo measures every 2 seconds) is hiding useful changes, but probably it's simply not picking up any real differences. Oh well!

## Smart alarm

The second night I had set the alarm to a more reasonable time, and also enabled its smart alarm mode (["SmartWake"](http://blog.myzeo.com/smartwake-a-different-way-to-wake-up/)), where the alarm will go off up to 30 minutes early if you are ever detected to be awake or in light sleep (as opposed to REM or deep sleep). One thing I forgot to do was take my melatonin; I keep my supplements in the car and there was a howling blizzard outside. It didn't bother me since I am not addicted to melatonin.

In the morning, the smart alarm mode seemed to work pretty well. I woke up early in a good mode, thought clearly and calmly about the situation - and went back to sleep. (It's a holiday, after all.)

## Replacing headband

Around 15 May 2011, I gave up on the original headband - it was getting too dirty to get good readings - and decided to rip it apart to see what it was made of, and to order a new [set of three](http://www.myzeo.com/product/31_headband_strap_sensor_replacement_package_x3_.cfm) for \$35 (which seems reasonable given the expensive material that the contacts are made of - silver fabric). A little googling found me a coupon, `FREESHIP`, but apparently it only applied to the Zeo itself and so the pads were actually \$40, or ~\$13 a piece. I won't say that buying replacement headbands every 4 or 5 months is something that *thrills* me, but \$20 a year for sleep data is a pretty small sum. (Certainly it's more cost-effective than even the better [nootropics](Nootropics) I use.)

In the future, I might try to make my own; buying the fabric is apparently cheaper than ordering from Zeo, see <http://www.flickr.com/photos/eokgnah/5489407407/>

# Melatonin
## Melatonin Analysis

The [following section](#melatonin-data) represents 5 or 6 months of data ([raw CSV data](/docs/2011-zeo-melatonin.csv)); some of the data is very noisy (especially towards the end as the headband got dirty), but hopefully the overall conclusions are not entirely untrustworthy. Let's look at some average. Zeo's website lets you enter in a 3-valued variable and then graph the average day for each variable against a particular recorded property like ZQ or total length of REM sleep. I defined one dummy variable, and decided that a '0' would correspond to not using melatonin, '1' would correspond to using it, and '2' would correspond to using a lot.

As expected, when using melatonin, total sleep and 'times awoken' were both reduced; the total fell by 12% (456 minutes to 402 minutes):

![](/images/zeo/melatonin-totalz.png)
![](/images/zeo/melatonin-timeswoken.png)

Deep sleep was unaffected ('time in wake' apparently had too small a sample):

![](/images/zeo/melatonin-timedeep.png)

Surprisingly, total REM sleep fell 20% (145 to 116 minutes):

![](/images/zeo/melatonin-timerem.png)

Given that the ZQ metric seems to be primarily determined by total sleep and REM sleep, it's not surprising - given the REM graph - that ZQ also fell:

![](/images/zeo/melatonin-zq.png)

REM's average fell by 29 minutes, deep sleep fell by 1 minute, but total sleep fell by 54 minutes; this implies that light sleep fell by 24 minutes. I am not sure what to make of this. While my original Melatonin heuristic of one hour turns out to be surprisingly accurate, I had expected light and deep sleep to take most of the time hit. Do I get enough REM sleep? I don't know how I would answer that.

I felt fine on the days after melatonin use, but I didn't track it very systematically. The best I have is the 'morning feel' parameter, which the Zeo asks you on waking up; in practice I entered the values as: a '2' means I woke feeling poor or unrested, '3' was fine or mediocre, and '4' was feeling good. When we graph the average of morning feel against melatonin use or non-use, we find that melatonin was noticeably better:

![](/images/zeo/melatonin-morningfeel.png)

Unfortunately, this dataseries doesn't distinguish between addition to melatonin or benefits from melatonin - perhaps the 3.2 is my 'normal' sleep quality and the 2.9 comes from withdrawal. So, onwards to other measures of mental performance. Also unfortunately, during this period, I didn't regularly do my [n-backing](DNB FAQ) either, so there'd be little point trying to graph that. What I spent a lot of my free time doing was editing `gwern.net`, so it might be worth looking at whether nights on melatonin correspond to increased edits the next day. In this graph of edits, the red dots are days without melatonin and the green are days with melatonin; I don't see any clear trend, although it's worth noting almost all of the very busy days were melatonin days:

![Days versus # of edits versus melatonin on/off](/images/zeo/melatonin-usage-versus-darcs.png)

## Melatonin Data

The data looked much better than the first night, except for a big 2-hour gap where I vaguely recall the sensor headband having slipped off. (I don't think it was because it was uncomfortable but due to shifting positions or something.) Judging from the cycle of sleep phases, I think I lost data on a REM peak. The REM peaks interest me because it's a standard theory of polyphasic sleeping that thriving on 2 or 3 hours of sleep a day is possible because REM (and deep sleep) is the only phase that truly matters, and REM can dominate sleep time through [REM rebound](!Wikipedia) and training.

![Second night](/images/zeo/2010-12-26.png)

Besides that, I noticed that time to sleep was 19 minutes that night. I also had forgotten to take my melatonin. Hmm...

Since I've begun this inadvertent experiment, I'll try continuing it, alternating days of melatonin usage. I claim in my melatonin article that usage seems to save about 1 hour of sleep/time, but there's several possible avenues. One could be quicker to fall asleep; one could awake fewer times; and one could have greater percentage of REM or deep sleep, reducing light sleep. (Light sleep doesn't seem very useful; I sometimes feel worse after light sleep.)

During the afternoon, I took a quick nap. I'm not a very good napper, it seems - only the first 5 minutes registered as even light sleep.

A dose of melatonin (1.5mg) and off to bed a bit early. I'm a little more impressed with the smart alarm; since I'm hard-of-hearing and audio alarms rarely if ever work, I usually use a [Sonic Alert](http://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Alert-SBP100-Portable-Vibrating/dp/B000EX3DQQ) vibrating alarm clock. But in the morning I woke up within a minute of the alarm, despite the lack of vibration or flashing lights. (The chart doesn't reflect this, but as a previous link says, distinguishing waking from sleeping can be difficult and the transitions are the least trustworthy parts of the data.)

The data was especially good today, with no big gaps:

![](/images/zeo/2010-12-27.png)

You can see an impressively regular sleep cycle, cycling between REM and light sleep. What's disturbing is the relative lack of deep sleep - down 4-5% (and there wasn't a lot to begin with). I suspect that the lack of deep sleep indicates I wasn't sleeping very well, but not badly enough to wake up, and this is probably due either to light from the Zeo itself or my lack of regular blankets and use of a sleeping bag. But the awakenings around 4-6 AM and on other days has made me suspicious that one of the cats is bothering me around here and I'm just forgetting it as I fall asleep.

The next night is another no-melatonin night. This time it took 79 minutes to fall asleep. Very bad, but far from unprecedented; this sort of thing is why I was interested in melatonin in the first place. Deep sleep is again limited in dispersion, with a block at the beginning and end, but mostly a regular cycle between light and REM:

![](/images/zeo/2010-12-28.png)

Melatonin night, and 32 minutes to sleep. (I'm starting to notice a trend here.) Another fairly regular cycle of phases, with some deep sleep at the beginning and end; 32 minutes to fall asleep isn't great but much better than 79 minutes.

![](/images/zeo/2010-12-29.png)

Perhaps I should try a biphasic schedule where I sleep for an hour at the beginning and end? That'd seem to pick up most of my deep sleep, and REM would hopefully take care of itself with REM rebound. Need to sum my average REM & deep sleep times (that sum seems to differ quite a bit, eg one fellow needs [4+ hours](http://blog.myzeo.com/forum/polyphasic-sleep-experiment-discussion/rem-deep-sleep/#p627). My own need seems to be similar) so I don't try to pick a schedule doomed to fail.

Another night, no melatonin. Time to sleep, just 18 minutes and the ZQ sets a new record even though my cat Stormy woke me up in the morning^[_Technology Review_ editor Emily Singer [noticed the same problem](http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/themeasuredlife/26894/) when using her Zeo.]:

![](/images/zeo/2010-12-30.png)

I personally blame this on being exhausted from 10 hours working on my transcription of [_The Notenki Memoirs_](docs/2002-notenki-memoirs). But a data point is a data point.

I spend New Year's Eve pretty much finishing _The Notenki Memoirs_ (transcribing the last of the biographies, the round-table discussion, and editing the images for inclusion), which exhausts me a fair bit as well; the champagne doesn't help, but between that and the melatonin, I fall asleep in a record-setting 7 minutes. Unfortunately, the headband came off somewhere around 5 AM:

![](/images/zeo/2010-12-31.png)

A cat? Waking up? Dunno.

Another relatively quick falling asleep night at 20 minutes. Which then gets screwed up as I simply can't stay asleep and then the cat begins bothering the heck out of me in the early morning:

![](/images/zeo/2011-01-01.png)

Melatonin night, which subjectively didn't go too badly; 20 minutes to sleep. But lots of wake time (long enough wakes that I remembered them) and 2 or 3 hours not recorded (probably from adjusting my scarf and the headband):

![](/images/zeo/2011-01-03.png)

Accidentally did another melatonin night (thought Monday was a no-melatonin night). Very good sleep - set records for REM especially towards the late morning which is curious. (The dreams were also very curious. I was an Evangelion character (Kaworu) tasked with riding that kind of carnival-like ride that goes up and drops straight down.) Also another quick falling asleep:

![](/images/zeo/2011-01-04.png)

Rather than 3 melatonin nights in a row, I skipped melatonin this night (and thus will have it the next one). Perhaps because I went to sleep so very late, and despite some awakenings, this was a record-setting night for ZQ and TODO deep sleep or REM sleep? :

![](/images/zeo/2011-01-05.png)

I also switched the alarm sounds 2 or 3 days ago to 'forest' sounds; they seem somewhat more pleasant than the beeping musical tones. The next night, data is all screwed up. What happened there? It didn't even record the start of the night, though it seemed to be active and working when I checked right before going to sleep. Odd.

Next 2 days aren't very interesting; first is no-melatonin, second is melatonin:

![](/images/zeo/2011-01-07.png)

![Off](/images/zeo/2011-01-11.png)

One of my chief Zeo complaints was the bright blue-white LCD screen. I had resorted to turning the base station over and surrounding it with socks to block the light. Then I looked closer at the labels for the buttons and learned that the up-down buttons changed the brightness and the LCD screen could be turned off. And I had read the part of the manual that explained that. D'oh!

![Off](/images/zeo/2011-01-21.png)

Off, but no data on the 22nd. No idea what the problem is - the headset seems to have been on all night.

On with a double-dose of melatonin because I was going to bed early; as you can see, didn't work:

![](/images/zeo/2011-01-23.png)

Off, no data on the 24th.

On, no data on the 25th. I don't know what went wrong on these two nights.

![Off](/images/zeo/2011-01-26.png)

The 27th (on for melatonin) yielded no data because, frustratingly, the Zeo was printing a 'write-protected' error on its screen; I assumed it had something to do with uploading earlier that day - perhaps I had yanked it out too quickly - and put it back in the computer, unmounted and went to eject it. But the memory card splintered on me! It was stuck and the end was splintering and little needles of plastic breaking off. I couldn't get it out and gave up. The next day (I slept reasonably well) I went back with a pair of needle-nose pliers. I had a backup memory card. After much trial and error, I figured out the card had to be FAT-formatted and have a directory structure that looked like `ZEO/ZEOSLEEP.DAT`. So that's that.


![Off](/images/zeo/2011-01-28.png)

![On](/images/zeo/2011-01-29.png)

30: on

31: off

1: on

2: off

3: on. Unfortunately, this night continues a long run of no data. Looking back, it doesn't *seem* to have been the fault of the new memory card, since some nights did have enough data for the Zeo website to generate graphs. I suspect that the issue is the pad getting dirty after more than a month of use. I hope so, anyway. I'll look around for rubbing alcohol to clean it. That night initially starts badly - the rubbing alcohol seemed to do nothing. After some messing around, I figure out that the headband seems to have loosened over the weeks and so while the sensor felt reasonably snug and tight and was transmitting, it wasn't snug enough. I tighten it considerably and actually get some decent data:

![Off](/images/zeo/2011-02-04.png)

5: on

![Off](/images/zeo/2011-02-06.png)

7: on

8: off

9: on

![Off](/images/zeo/2011-02-10.png)

11: on? The previous night, I began paying closer attention to when it was and was not reading me (usually the latter). Pushing hard on it made it eventually read me, but tightening the headband hadn't helped the previous several nights. Pushing and not pushing, I noticed a subtle click. Apparently the band part with the metal sensor pad connects to the wireless unit by 3 little black metal nubs; 2 were solidly in place, but the third was completely loose. Suspicious, I try pulling on the band *without* pushing on the wireless unit - leaving the loose connection loose. Sure enough, no connection was registered. I push on the unit while loosing the headband - and the connection worked. I felt I finally had solved it. It wasn't a loose headband or me pulling it off at night or oils on the metal sensors or a problem with the SD card. I was too tired to fix it when I had the realization, but resolved the next morning to fix it by wrapping a rubber band around the wireless unit and band. This turned out to not interfere with recharging, and when I took a short nap, the data looked fine and gapless. So! The long data drought is hopefully over.

On the 15th of February, I had a very early flight to San Francisco. That night and every night from then on, I was using melatonin, so we'll just include all the nights for which any sensible data was gathered. Oddly enough, the data and ZQs seem bad (as one would expect from sleeping on a couch), but I wake up feeling fairly refreshed.

![](/images/zeo/2011-02-15.png)

Then I took a long break on updating this page; when I had a month or two of data, I uploaded to Zeo again, and buckled down and figured out how to have [ImageMagick](!Wikipedia) [crop](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/crop/#crop) pages. The shell script (for screenshots of my browser, YMMV) is `for file in *.png; do mogrify +repage -crop 700x350+350+285 $file; done;`

General observations: almost all these nights were on melatonin. Not far into this period, I realized that the little rubberband was not working, and I hauled out my red [electrical tape](!Wikipedia) and tightened it but good; and again, you can see the transition from crappy recordings to much cleaner recordings.

April 4th was one of the few nights that I was not on melatonin during this timespan; I occasionally take a weekend and try to drop all supplements and nootropics besides the multivitamins and fish oil, which includes my melatonin pills. This night (or more precisely, that Sunday evening) I also stayed up late working on my computer, getting in to bed at 12:25 AM. You can see how well that worked out. During the 2 AM wake period, it occurred to me that I didn't especially want to sacrifice a day to show that computer work can make for bad sleep (which I already have plenty of citations for in [the Melatonin essay](Melatonin#health-performance), and I gave in, taking a pill. That worked out much better, with a relatively normal number of wakings after 2 AM and a reasonable amount of deep & REM sleep.

# One-legged standing

Seth Roberts found that for him, standing a lot [helped him sleep](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866). This seems very plausible to me - more fatigue to repair, closer to ancestral conditions of constant walking - and tallied with my own experience. (One summer I worked at Yawgoog Scout Camp, where I spent the entire day on my feet; I always slept very well though my bunk was uncomfortable.) He also found that stressing his legs by standing on one at a time for a few minutes also [helped him sleep](http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/). That did not seem as plausible to me. But still worth trying: standing is free, and if it does nothing, at least I got a little more exercise.

Roberts tried a fairly complicated randomized routine. I am simply alternating days as with melatonin (note that I have resumed taking melatonin every day). My standing method is also simple; for 5 minutes, I stand on one leg, rise up onto the ball of my foot (because my calves are in good shape), and then sink down a foot or two and hold it until the burning sensation in my thigh forces me to switch to the other leg. (I seem to alternate every minute.) I walk my dog most every day, so the effect is not as simple as 'some moderate exercise that day'; in the next experiment, I might try 5 minutes of dumbbell bicep curves instead.

So far the results are promising. Of the 5 days, 3 are 'on' and 2 are off. All 3 on-days have higher ZQs than the 2 off-days.
