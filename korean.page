Why my interesting in Korean? I have rationalized to myself that Korean has higher [marginal utility](!Wikipedia)/[comparative advantage](!Wikipedia) to learn compared to Chinese or Japanese.

There are nigh-infinite numbers of translators for Japanese stuff (most anime worth watching has fansubs, and even most classical Japanese literature worth reading has been translated at one time or another by folks like [Donald Keene](!Wikipedia)) and somewhat also for Chinese^[(The population argument is even stronger for Chinese, but that's not a live option for me; things like ["Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard"](http://pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html) and the notes by Arthur Waley or Giles and all the discussions of translations issues in the Chinese literature and histories and works like _Science & Civilization in China_ I've read have convinced me that learning Chinese is not a good use of time, and that I would give up part-way.], but there is remarkably little Korean.

This is surprising to a degree; Korea is a heavily developed country, well beyond China and comparable to Japan, with a complex recent history that ought to inspire much literature. We might expect $\frac{2}{5}$ as much Korean literature as Japanese because Korea (50 million) has $\frac{4}{10}$ the population of Japan (127 million), but there seems to be far less Korean literature. My local library stocks hundreds of Japanese works (no matter the genre or age) and perhaps 10-20 Korean works (I've looked), and doesn't seem unusual in that regard.

Money:

> Many people ask me about banking and I have found that using Korean Exchange Bank is the best way to sent money to the US. The commission is no more than 18,000 won and if you have an account with them, even less. Also they have something called an Easy One Remittance account. This account is linked to your American account and you can transfer money into this account via online banking in English! Here is the website: <http://www.keb.co.kr/main/en/>

Application:

> Good planning would involve getting a professional headshot done of yourself and emailing to key schools and every recruiter email address that you can find, and email them repeatedly every 2-3 days until you get responses. Make sure you don't mass mail, as it looks tacky to some. Make sure you mention in your email subject line about your nationality and key selling attributes (usually age, appearance, and attitude are better than talking about how experienced or qualified you are) and when you'll be in Korea. As in: "Handsome 26 yr old Canadian in Seoul available after two weeks" or something to that effect. They get loads of emails a day from people that send nondescript subject lines like: "My resume" or "Applying for the Mokdong job".
> Try to line up as many contacts as possible, particularly with recruiters. Love them or hate them, they are in touch with schools all day and know more about what's currently available than if you were to look for schools on your own. Try to get cell numbers from as many contacts as possible, as recruiters and managers at schools are known for their lousy email management and response times. They're much better at answering cellphones
