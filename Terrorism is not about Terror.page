In the spirit of [Robin Hanson](!Wikipedia)'s X Is Not About X posts (see ["Politics isn't about Policy"](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html)), I'd like to offer one of my own.

[Terrorism](!Wikipedia) is *not* about terror; it's not even about politics. It's about socializing.

# The problem

From ["What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy"](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2008.32.4.78), Max Abrahms 2008 ([PDF](http://maxabrahms.com/pdfs/DC_250-1846.pdf)):

> "Does the terrorist's decision-making process conform to the strategic model? The answer appears to be no. The record of terrorist behavior does not adhere to the model's three core assumptions. Seven common tendencies of terrorist organizations flatly contradict them. Together, these seven terrorist tendencies represent important empirical puzzles for the strategic model, posing a formidable challenge to the conventional wisdom that terrorists are rational actors motivated foremost by political ends."

> "The seven puzzles...are:<br>
> 1) terrorist organizations do not achieve their stated political goals by attacking civilians;<br>
> 2) terrorist organizations never use terrorism as a last resort and seldom seize opportunities to become productive nonviolent political parties; <br>
> 3) terrorist organizations reflexively reject compromise proposals offering significant policy concessions by the target government;<br>
> 4) terrorist organizations have protean political platforms; <br>
> 5) terrorist organizations generally carry out anonymous attacks, precluding target countries from making policy concessions;<br>
> 6) terrorist organizations with identical political platforms routinely attack each other more than their mutually professed enemy; and<br>
> 7) terrorist organizations resist disbanding when they consistently fail to achieve their political platforms or when their stated political grievances have been resolved..."

## Terrorist ineffectiveness

> "In a [previous study of mine]^[That previous study is Max Abrahms's ["Why Terrorism Does Not Work"](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/792/why_terrorism_does_not_work.html); _International Security_ 31.2 (2006) 42-78. [PDF](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/is3102_pp042-078_abrahms.pdf).] assessing terrorism's coercive effectiveness, I found that in a sample of 28 well-known terrorist campaigns, the terrorist organizations accomplished their stated policy goals 0 percent of the time by attacking civilians."

> "The al-Qaida military strategist, [Abul-Walid](!Wikipedia "Abu al-Walid"), complained that with its 'hasty changing of strategic targets', al-Qaida was engaged in nothing more than 'random chaos'. Other disgruntled al-Qaida members have reproached the organization for espousing political objectives that 'shift with the wind'."

# The solution
So, then, what is the explanation for such self-defeating, irrational actions?

> "There is comparatively strong theoretical and empirical evidence that people become terrorists not to achieve their organization's declare political agenda, but to develop strong affective ties with other terrorist members. In other words, the preponderance of evidence is that people participate in terrorist organizations for the social solidarity, not for their political return."

One last quote:

> "Second, members from a wide variety of terrorist groups...say that they joined these armed struggles...to maintain or develop social relations with other terrorist members. These are not the statements of a small number of terrorists; in the Turkish sample, for instance, the 1,100 terrorists interviewed were 10 times more likely to say that they joined the terrorist organization 'because their friends were members' than because of the 'ideology' of the group."

There are of course many other interesting points; both of Abrahms's papers are well worth reading.

The foregoing was originally [posted](http://lesswrong.com/lw/51/terrorism_is_not_about_terror/) to [LessWrong.com](http://lesswrong.com/), where it was energetically critiqued.

## Terrorism does too work!

There are multiple memorable instances where terrorism seems to work. This should be no surprise; after all, if terrorism never worked, would we ever be concerned about it? Of course not. Terrorism works, darn it!^[See, for example, [Robert Pape](!Wikipedia)'s _Dying to Win: the Strategic Logic of Terrorism_ or "The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism", _American Political Science Review_, 97(3); August 2003, pg 13.]

Cited examples include the [IRA](!Wikipedia), the [PLO](!Wikipedia), [Hezbollah](!Wikipedia), and [Hamas](!Wikipedia)

As one commentator wrote:

> "Let's stop pretending that terrorism doesn't work. Do you think England would ever have talked with the IRA, or that Israel would have given territory to the Palestinians, if not for terrorism?"

### NO WAI

There are several possible replies. For example, Pape's work is focused pretty much only on [suicide attacks](!Wikipedia "suicide attack"); his findings on effectiveness, even if correct, may not generalize to the many non-suicide attacks. Further, Abrahms consider it unclear how reasonable his specific analysis is:

> "Not only is his sample of terrorist campaigns modest, but they targeted only a handful of countries: ten of the eleven campaigns analyzed were directed against the same three countries (Israel, Sri Lanka, and Turkey), with six of the campaigns directed against the same country (Israel). More important, Pape does not examine whether the terrorist campaigns achieved their core policy objectives. In his assessment of Palestinian terrorist campaigns, for example, he counts the limited withdrawals of the Israel Defense Forces from parts of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 1994 as two separate terrorist victories, ignoring the 167 percent increase in the number of Israeli settlers during this period—the most visible sign of Israeli occupation. Similarly, he counts as a victory the Israeli decision to release Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from prison in October 1997, ignoring the hundreds of imprisonments and targeted assassinations of Palestinian terrorists throughout the Oslo “peace process.” Pape’s data therefore reveal only that select terrorist campaigns have occasionally scored tactical victories, not that terrorism is an effective strategy for groups to achieve their policy objectives."

Another is that this is an essentially statistical argument, over dozens or hundreds of terrorist groups. Adumbrating 4 somewhat successful groups would invalidate an assertion along the lines of "*All* terrorist groups are unsuccessful", but of course no one is making that claim. (Just that *most* are.)

The previously quoted 0% success rate figure is a bit low. "Why Terrorism Doesn't Work" backtracks a little, and considers a larger group (42, not 20). This larger group has a 7% success rate.

> "As frequently noted, Hezbollah successfully coerced the multinational peacekeepers and Israelis from southern Lebanon in 1984 and 2000, and the [Tamil Tigers](!Wikipedia) won control over the northern and eastern coastal areas of Sri Lanka from 1990 on. In the aggregate, however, the terrorist groups achieved their main policy objectives only three out of 42 times-—a 7 percent success rate. Within the coercion literature, this rate of success is considered extremely low. It is substantially lower, for example, than even the success rate of [economic sanctions](!Wikipedia), which are widely regarded as only minimally effective."

> "This study analyzes the political plights of 28 terrorist groups-—the complete list of [foreign terrorist organizations](!Wikipedia "U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations") (FTOs) as designated by the U.S. Department of State since 2001. The data yield two unexpected findings. First, the groups accomplished their 42 policy objectives only 7 percent of the time."

Perhaps these studies are simply too harsh and demanding?

> "Using this list provides a check against selecting cases on the dependent variable, which would artificially inflate the success rate because the most well known policy outcomes involve terrorist victories (e.g., the U.S. withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 1984^[See [1983 Beirut barracks bombing](!Wikipedia)]). Furthermore, because all of the terrorist groups have remained active since 2001, ample time has been allowed for each group to make progress on achieving its policy goals, thereby reducing the possibility of artificially deflating the success rate through too small a time frame. In fact, the terrorist groups have had significantly more time than five years to accomplish their policy objectives: the groups, on average, have been active since 1978; the majority has practiced terrorism since the 1960s and 1970s; and only four were established after 1990."

A third counters the appeal with Pape's authority with the observation that "terrorism doesn't work" is an old vein of thought; in 1976, [Walter Laquer](!Wikipedia) argued in "The Futility of Terrorism" that terrorism is an ineffective strategy, and [Thomas Schelling](!Wikipedia) said it "almost never appears to accomplish anything politically significant."^[Schelling. "What Purposes Can 'International Terrorism' Serve?", _Violence, Terrorism, and Justice_ 1991], and [Loren Lomasky](!Wikipedia) concurs in this pessimistic take^["In almost none of the instances of terrorist activity is there any genuine likelihood that the assault on person or property will serve to advance the claimed political ends." from "The Political Significance of Terrorism", _Violence, Terrorism, and Justice_]; Lomasky goes so far as to argue that terrorism is outright counterproductive in strengthening the targeted government.

One last consideration is that the listed groups may not've been very successful at all.

#### Hitting the broad side

The follow quotes are from Wikipedia, about the previously cited groups. Where possible, I quote the summary of that group's aims.

> "The IRA's stated objective is to end "British rule in Ireland," and according to its constitution, it wants "to establish an Irish Socialist Republic, based on the Proclamation of 1916." Until the 1998 Belfast Agreement, it sought to end Northern Ireland's status within the United Kingdom and bring about a united Ireland by force of arms and political persuasion."

> "In 1988, the PLO officially endorsed a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side contingent on specific terms such as making East Jerusalem capital of the Palestinian state and giving Palestinians the right of return to land occupied by Palestinians prior to the 1948 and 1967 wars with Israel."

> "Hamas wants to create an Islamic state in the West Bank and the Gaza strip, a goal which combines Palestinian nationalism with Islamist objectives. Hamas's 1988 charter calls for the replacement of Israel and the Palestinian Territories with an Islamic Palestinian state."

> "Hezbollah's 1985 manifesto listed its three main goals as "putting an end to any colonialist entity" in Lebanon, bringing the Phalangists to justice for "the crimes they [had] perpetrated," and the establishment of an Islamic regime in Lebanon. Recently, however, Hezbollah has made little mention of establishing an Islamic state, and forged alliances across religious lines. Hezbollah leaders have also made numerous statements calling for the destruction of Israel, which they refer to as a "Zionist entity... built on lands wrested from
their owners.""

One striking thing about the goals of these groups is how few of them have been accomplished, and how often they seem to have sabotaged and undone real progress towards resolution of their grievances. Anyone familiar with Palestine and Israel in particular will wonder whether Hamas or the PLO have helped the Palestinian cause more than they've hurt (an observation equally applicable to Ireland).

#### Biases

These ideas and analyses can make people quite angry. They view the previously mentioned organizations, as well as al-Qaeda, as being such obvious examples that anyone suggesting that terrorism may be useless is seen as being a naive idiot or perhaps being dishonest in some way. The level of emotion seems quite unwarranted, and makes me think that there may be [cognitive biases](!Wikipedia "cognitive bias") at play.

The [Availability heuristic](!Wikipedia) (when "people base their prediction of the frequency of an event or the proportion within a population based on how easily an example can be brought to mind") seems to apply here. It is much easier to think of claimed attacks than anonymous ones, even though it was hinted at the beginning that terrorist attacks for which the group claims responsibility are actually in the minority! This very counter-intuitive claim seems to be borne out

> "Since the emergence of modern terrorism in 1968, 64% of worldwide terrorist attacks have been carried out by unknown perpetrators. Anonymous terrorism has been rising, with 3 out of 4 attacks going unclaimed since September 11, 2001. Anonymous terrorism is particularly prevalent in Iraq, where the US military has struggled to determine whether the violence was perpetrated by Shiite or Sunni groups with vastly different political platforms."^[Abrahms references his analysis of a RAND dataset, and also Bruce Hoffman's "Why Terrorists Don't Claim Credit (in _Terrorism and Political Violence_, Vol 9 #1 1997).]

(Inasmuch as people read about identified attacks and largely ignore anonymous attacks, there may also be some [confirmation bias](!Wikipedia) at work as well.)

## It's about feeling better

Isn't it possible that many terrorist acts are really for the purpose of making the terrorists feel better about themselves and their in-groups? Like teenagers playing pranks, only with often-lethal consequences.

Another question: how well would you say the movie Fight Club demonstrates this hypothesis in action?

## About the chicks, man

One commenter suggested that Abrahms *almost* has it right. Terrorists are seeking social ties, but only as a substitute for female companionship. The specific example was the American novel/movie _[Fight Club](!Wikipedia)_; certainly, when one thinks about it, it's hard to not notice that the narrator goes--thanks to leading a terrorist organization--from being a single loser who has to pretend to be ill (mentally and physically) to get any attention or social interaction, to being an incredibly popular guy with dozens of subordinates to hang out with day and night and a girlfriend.

But an even better example might be Fatah's [Black September](!Wikipedia "Black September (group)") cell.

In _[The Atlantic](!Wikipedia)_'s ["All You Need Is Love"](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200112/hoffman), Bruce Hoffman writes that a senior Fatah general told him of how they decided that Black September had outlived its usefulness, and needed to be dissolved. But that was problematic. Black September likely would not take dissolution lying down:

> "'It was the most elite unit we had. The members were suicidal -— not in the sense of religious terrorists who surrender their lives to ascend to heaven but in the sense that we could send them anywhere to do anything and they were prepared to lay down their lives to do it. No question. No hesitation. They were absolutely dedicated and absolutely ruthless.'"

What, then, did Fatah do? They must've succeeded; we all know Black September is ancient history.

> "My host, who was one of [Abu Iyad](!Wikipedia)'s most trusted deputies, was charged with devising a solution. For months both men thought of various ways to solve the Black September problem, discussing and debating what they could possibly do, short of killing all these young men, to stop them from committing further acts of terror.<br>
> Finally they hit upon an idea. Why not simply marry them off? In other words, why not find a way to give these men -— the most dedicated, competent, and implacable fighters in the entire PLO -— a reason to live rather than to die?
Having failed to come up with any viable alternatives, the two men put their plan in motion."

And it worked!

> "So approximately a hundred of these beautiful young women were brought to Beirut. There, in a sort of PLO version of a college mixer, boy met girl, boy fell in love with girl, boy would, it was hoped, marry girl. There was an additional incentive, designed to facilitate not just amorous connections but long-lasting relationships. The hundred or so Black Septemberists were told that if they married these women, they would be paid $3,000; given an apartment in Beirut with a gas stove, a refrigerator, and a television; and employed by the PLO in some nonviolent capacity. Any of these couples that had a baby within a year would be rewarded with an additional $5,000.<br>
> Both Abu Iyad and the future general worried that their scheme would never work. But, as the general recounted, without exception the Black Septemberists fell in love, got married, settled down, and in most cases started a family...the general explained, not one of them would agree to travel abroad, for fear of being arrested and losing all that they had -— that is, being deprived of their wives and children. 'And so', my host told me, 'that is how we shut down Black September and eliminated terrorism. It is the only successful case that I know of.'"
