The fundamental idea of lifelogging is that computing resources are pervasive and cheap: Having not just a computer, but I/O peripherals and indefinite storage space. We may spend 50% of our waking time with access to a computer (if not actually using it), but there is a profound difference between 50% and 100%, a difference much greater than what the mere numerical fact of doubling would suggest.
Instead, we ought to expect order of magnitude changes. Cell phones may boost the access to 99%, but they miss the crucial 1%. Even still, cell phones have woven their way into the lies of Generation Y and Zers: they aren't just communication tools used occasionally, they have ascended almost to a new sense or a new mental world.

Random thoughts: telecoms know this, and seek to sell our cellphones to us piecemeal; a world parceled up and rented out will bring quite a bit.
Will cheap social contact mean that ever more time has to be spent on social grooming? If it takes an hour to walk to a friend's house, they will forgive you for only hanging out once a week. But if it takes 2 seconds to ring them up or text message them...

When we go from 99% to 100%, cell phones can become _part of our minds_. Consider: it takes less than a second to move your dominant hand from anywhere to anywhere. (Try it out.) Imagine wearing a [heads up display](!Wikipedia) with perhaps a keyboard on your forearm. Any message from the computer to you will reach your brain in something under a tenth of a second, and you can being responding in less than a second. This may seem cumbersome, but our very thoughts and memories aren't much faster! We've all experienced moments where it was faster to go to a browser and look up a factoid than to struggle with our memory and work with associations and hope the factoid will suddenly pop into mind; fact is, even our short-term or working memory operator on the time scale of fractions of seconds and seconds.

Isn't that amazing? Our programs are as 'far away' as our memories! With the right interface, a computer is competitive with our very mind. We're not even postulating way-out-there Sci-Fi technology like brain-computer interfaces, just normal technology produced commercially right now, which you could go out and buy or assemble yourself.

Hitherto, computers have been best known for replacing _work_. Number crunching, manufacturing, etc. But as overhead & 'friction' shrink, computers can increasingly replace **mental processes**.

Consider [Mnemosyne]() & SRS in general. We could view this as a crude, high-overhead replacement for an eidetic memory; or we could view as the computerization of a mental process - imagine one kept the flashcards in a [memory palace](!Wikipedia) and every day 'walked' through it. Here we have a very simple^[run the program and do whatever it tells you] *computerized* habit replacing a very complex[^the advanced mnemonic techniques have always had a small population of users; even [Giordano Bruno](!Wikipedia) may've not used all the techniques he covers] *mental* habit.

Consider this [XKCD](!Wikipedia) comic, ["I know you're listening"](http://xkcd.com/525/); it's funny as a parody of [Pascal's Wager](), but it's also funny because we know we could never really do that (the novelty would wear off too quickly), and the fact that we could never really do it means it'd be all the funnier if someone did that and someone *was* listening. Or consider the standard advice for people attempting to induce [lucid dream](!Wikipedia)s: to periodically check for dream-like events & situations, in the hope that this habit will carry over to when actually in a dream. But who can randomly stop and deliberately ask whether they're in a dream? When I know I'm awake, I won't ask; and when I don't know I'm awake, I won't think about it...

But a computer can do this! Waking up at random times is trivial for a computer; utilities like [cron] have been around for half a century now. We could program all sorts of habits into it: check your shoelaces, see whether you can fly, say aloud one of its canned scripts (like the XKCD one), review a flashcard scheduled for that minute, get a reminder of upcoming deadlines, etc. We can imagine even more sophisticated ones: the computer could say 'did you remember to drop your daughter off at the daycare? I noticed my camera picked up an image of her getting into the car but none of her getting out'^[A functionality that would be appreciated by any parent who has absent-mindedly left their child in the car to bake to death.].

The problem with a mental habit is that it either needs to be constantly in mind - and taking up precious mental space - or it is 'out of sigh, out of mind'. Computers could not care less about this.

So we might divide portable computers' functionality into 2 major category:

- memory; taken to its extreme, it becomes lifelogging
- supervision
