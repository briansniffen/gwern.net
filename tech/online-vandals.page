description: Passwords and accounts
---

A friend of a friend recently had some accounts vandalized.  Most of
the following started as a response to her, with advice about how to
handle this situation.  I hope that some of it can be of use to
others.  She had accounts on several web sites.  One was broken into.
Those users with shared account names and passwords across several
sites had their other accounts vandalized.  Those who had different
usernames but the same password between sites still had some
problems---particularly if they had links in forum posts or image tags
for signatures that revealed the links between accounts.

She changed all her passwords immediately after noticing the attack.
It sounds like she did exactly the best thing she could have done,
both before and after this violation.  She kept different passwords
for different places, and she changed her passwords immediately
afterwards.  Having a stronger password would not have protected her
against this sort of attack, but it is something that would help her
against other common attacks.

She did ask what could be done about this vandalism: are police or the
FBI going to help?  What about if there's real money involved?  Since
there have been news stories covering the group responsible, why
haven't they been punished and their communities shut down?  Is there
some code of silence?  Are they an online Mafia?

As far as the people who act like this: they're not the Mafia.  They're
hoodlums.  They're the electronic equivalent of kids egging a
schoolmate's house.  Just like those kids, they attack those who are
different with the goal of eliciting visible pain.  They attacked her
social groups because you're artsy, cultured types and these jerks have
a record of getting visible moaning and wailing out of such communities.

Her response, which appears to have been a quick clean-up and
professional demeanor, may be her best defense: she's not a fun
target, so they'll move on to pick on somebody else.  Alternately,
they'll move on to 10th grade or meet members of the appropriate sex or
otherwise find a less corrosive hobby.

Indeed, she's identified exactly the relevant line for police
intervention.  The FBI, USSS, and even local police can and will care
about such matters, just as soon as they cross the line into an
interesting crime.  A cop or a DA wants to leave a trail of big,
interesting criminals.  They will stop shoplifters, but not
jaywalkers---and they'd rather catch car thieves.  Just so, they'd
rather go after people who are stealing thousands of dollars or
applying for fraudulent mortgages across state lines.  Scribbling
graffiti over an artist's work---or a hundred artists' works---isn't
going to attract police attention.  If there is demonstrable financial
damage, she might have success talking to the cops if she mentions
that dollar amount up front.  Anything over $10000 can easily attract
Federal help.  I think $1000 is around the threshold for local police.
It's typical to bill your own time at your professional rate for
clean-up work.  So if she spent more than ten hours cleaning up her
own computers and her accounts at others, or can surpass a few hundred
hours of collective clean-up in her communities, she might find a
sympathetic DA.  If not, she probably won't.

It's important to remember that these are analogous to the local
hoodlums who egg houses and knock over mailboxes.  This is a gang of
weak people who enjoy hurting others to gain a few minutes of
perceived strength.  The best that you can do is:

 1. Keep offline backups.  Update them regularly.  "Offline" means that
    no amount of software hacking can hurt them or, through them, you:
    For example, mine are on a drive in a safe.  It comes out of the
    same to be plugged into my computer only when the network is off.
    The safe is fire-resistant.

 2. Use passwords that are hard to guess, even for someone who knows
    your real name and your login names on every site you use.

 3. Use different passwords in different places.  The administrators
    of sites like web fora and your communities are only human.  They
    will make mistakes, and the tools they use will fail them.  Your
    passwords and account data *will* be leaked.  I expect about one
    of my own accounts to spill its data each year.  I do not write
    down anything I don't want to risk seeing published.

    One good way to do this is a password schema.  Consider a common
    phrase, like "Once I was the King of Spain."  You might use that
    to remember a password like "111IwtKoS."  Now you can replace
    arbitrary letters with references to particular accounts.  For
    example, your amazon account might have the password "111Iw@KoS"
    while your paypal account might have the password "1$f11wtKoS,"
    where "paypal" reminds you of "dollar friend" and you remember the
    rest as your general password schema.  Then you might change
    schemas once every year or so.  To do that well, you'd have to
    maintain a list of everywhere you have an account---something best
    not to do on the computer itself, but not a terrible thing to keep
    in a drawer near your computer.

 4. When you do suffer from attacks like this, clean up quickly.
    Present the online persona of a responsible adult and you'll be
    treated like one, even by bozos like this.  Don't let them think
    that they cost you more than a minute or two of time, and they'll
    find somebody else to pick on.  That means don't post responses to
    them in their fora, or even acknowledge it in your own spaces beyond
    a brief apology to your readers.

From what she wrote to me and how she wrote it, I have the impression
that she already knows all of this.  But I do hope that it's of use to
others.  Most of all, remember that this isn't a vast new Metaverse
unconstrained by ordinary social laws.  It's just people talking and
writing.  They're driven by the same needs as the people you meet in
the ordinary course of life.
