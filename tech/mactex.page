title: MacTeX and XeTeX
---

I'm a great fan of Knuth's TeX system.  I use it for papers, markup on
literate programs, and slides for talks.  I even use it for letters
and address labels.  For several years now I've had a split setup: my
Macs use teTeX from MacPorts while my Debian GNU/Linux machines use
TeXLive.  TeXLive is a much nicer system---it has dozens of packages
that Thomas "te" Esser never could ship with teTeX.  But the
convenience of using MacPorts kept me with its teTeX package.

I'm now delighted to have discovered MacTeX.  It's a Mac-friendly
TeXLive package, including DVI previewers, TeX-aware spelling
checkers, and everything you'd ordinarily find in a TeX system.  It
even includes a working XeTeX.  XeTeX is a recent innovation to
support Unicode and fancy TrueType fonts in TeX.  You can just write

    \usepackage{fontspec}
    \setmainfont{Times New Roman:LetterCase=SmallCaps}

and away you go.  It makes it easy to use system fonts in TeX.  Now
documents produced in ordinary applications (e.g., OmniGraffle) can
mesh easily with TeX documents.
