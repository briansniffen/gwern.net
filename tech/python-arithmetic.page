title: Python Arithmetic
---

Proof that Python is no good for serious work: its arithmetic operators
don't handle expressions more than 8 operations long.  Certainly the
tens digit of this ought to be 0 or 5:

    >>> 950 + \
    ... 850 + \
    ... 750 + \
    ... 650 + \
    ... 550 + \
    ... 450 + \
    ... 350 + \
    ... 250 + \
    ... 150 + \
    ... 050
    4990

Isn't it amazing that this sort of code persists?
