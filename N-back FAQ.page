# B-back training

## Should I do multiple daily sessions, or just one?

[Most users](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e989058544ad122) seem to go for one long N-back session, citing the idea that this forces long-term concentration. Others do one session in the morning and one in the evening so they can focus better on each one.

More than that and you're probably wasting time due to overhead, and may not be getting enough exercise in each session.

## When should I do my session?

There is [some research support](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/43b64f72bc6dabf0) that doing N-back before bed is better than most other times; ["Sleep Accelerates the Improvement in Working Memory Performance"](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/40/10145) ([PDF](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/10145.pdf):

> "Working memory (WM) performance, which is an important factor for determining problem-solving and reasoning ability, has been firmly believed to be constant. However, recent findings have demonstrated that WM performance has the potential to be improved by repetitive training. Although various skills are reported to be improved by sleep, the beneficial effect of sleep on WM performance has not been clarified. Here, we show that improvement in WM performance is facilitated by posttraining naturalistic sleep. A spatial variant of the n-back WM task was performed by 29 healthy young adults who were assigned randomly to three different experimental groups that had different time schedules of repetitive n-back WM task sessions, with or without intervening sleep. Intergroup and intersession comparisons of WM performance (accuracy and response time) profiles showed that n-back accuracy after posttraining sleep was significantly improved compared with that after the same period of wakefulness, independent of sleep timing, subject's vigilance level, or circadian influences. On the other hand, response time was not influenced by sleep or repetitive training schedules. The present study indicates that improvement in n-back accuracy, which could reflect WM capacity, essentially benefits from posttraining sleep."

## Are strategies good or bad?

People [frequently](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fd08b93399939fb9) [ask](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d779edc2b922db95) [and](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/676676a8e34f56d3) [discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/c4eaff3059759531) whether they should use some sort of strategy, and if so, what.

Many N-backers adopt an 'intuition' strategy. Rather than explicitly rehearsing sequences of letters ('f-up, h-middle; f-up, h-middle; g-down, f-up...'), they simply think very hard and wait for a feeling that they should press 'a' (audio match), or 'l' (location match). Some, like SwedishChef can be quite vociferous [about it](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d779edc2b922db95):


> "The challenges are in helping people understand that dual-n-back is NOT about remembering n number of visual and auditory stimuli.  It's about developing a new mental process that intuitively recognizes when it has seen or heard a stimuli n times ago."<br>
> "Initially, most students of dual n-back want to remember n items as fast as they can so they can conquer the dual-n-back hill.  They use their own already developed techniques to help them remember.  They may try to hold the images in their head mentally and review them every time a new image is added and say the sounds out loud and review the sounds everytime a new sound is added.  This is NOT what we want.  We want the brain to learn a new process that intuitively recognizes if an item and sound was shown 3 back or 4 back.  It's sort of like playing a new type of musical instrument.<br>
> I've helped some students on the site try to understand this.  It's not about how much you can remember, it's about learning a new process.  In theory, this new process translates into a better working memory, which helps you make connections better and faster."

Jaeggi herself is [more moderate](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/08bc4ee2ccd0df80):

> "I would NOT recommend you [train the visual and auditory task separately] if you want to train the dual-task (the one we used in our study). The reason is that the combination of both modalities is an entirely different task than doing both separately! If you do the task separately, I assume you use some "rehearsal strategies", e.g. you repeat the letters or positions for yourself. In the dual-task version however, these strategies might be more difficult to apply (since you have to do 2 things simultaneously...), and that is exactly what we want... We don't want to train strategies, we want to train processes. Processes that then might help you in the performance of other, non-trained tasks (and that is our ultimate goal). So, it is not important to reach a 7- or 8-back... It is important to fully focus your attention on the task as well as possible.<br>
> "I can assure you, it is a very tough training regimen.... You can't divert your attention even 1 second (I'm sure you have noticed...). But eventually, you will see that you get better at it and maybe you notice that you are better able to concentrate on certain things, to remember things more easily, etc. (hopefully)."

> "this is a question i am being asked a lot and unfortunately, i don't really know whether i can help with that. i can only tell you what we tell (or rather not tell) our participants and what they tell us. so, first of all, we don't tell people at all what strategy to use - it is up to them. thing is, there are some people that tell us what you describe above, i.e. some of them tell us that it works best if they don't use a strategy at all and just "let the squares/letters flow by". but of course, many participants also use more conscious strategies like rehearsing or grouping items together. but again - we let people chose their strategies themselves!"[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/955524caaf2e9001)

But it may make no difference. Even if you are engaged in a complex mnemonic-based strategy, you're still working your memory. Strategies may not even work; quoting from Jaeggi's 2008 paper:

> "By this account, one reason for having obtained transfer between working memory and measures of _Gf_ is that our training procedure may have facilitated the ability to control attention. This ability would come about because the constant updating of memory representations with the presentation of each new stimulus requires the engagement of mechanisms to shift attention. Also, our training task discourages the development of simple task-specific strategies that can proceed in the absence of controlled allocation of attention."

Hopefully even if a trick lets you jump from 3-back to 5-back, Brain Workshop will just keep escalating the difficulty until you are challenged again. It's not the level you reach, but the work you do.

# And the flashing right/wrong feedback?

A matter of preference, although those in favor of disabling the visual feedback (`SHOW_FEEDBACK = False`) seem to be [slightly](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/775fba46e8c163f1) [more](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/420f332fcd4317c9) vocal or numerous. Brain Twister [apparently](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/a8934cc1e04075f9) doesn't give feedback. [Jaeggi says](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/955524caaf2e9001):

> "the gaming literature also disagrees on this issue - there are different ways to think about this: whereas feedback after each trial gives you immediate feedback whether you did right or wrong, it can also be distracting as you are constantly monitoring (and evaluating) your performance. we decided that we wanted people to fully and maximally concentrate on the task itself and thus chose the approach to only give feedback at the end of the run. however, we have newer versions of the task for kids in which we give some sort of feedback (points) for each trial. thus - i can't tell you what the optimal way is - i guess there are interindividual differences and preferences as well."


## How can I do better on N-back?

Focus harder. Play more. Sleep well, and eat healthily. The less stressful you are, the better you can do.

## Am I wasting time if I can't get past 3-back?

Not at all! The crucial thing about N-back is just that you are stressing your working memory, that's all. The actual level doesn't matter very much, just whether you can barely manage it; it is somewhat like lifting weights, in that regard. From Jaeggi 2008:

> "The finding that the transfer to _Gf_ remained even after taking the specific training effect into account seems to be counterintuitive, especially because the specific training effect is also related to training time. The reason for this capacity might be that participants with a very high level of n at the end of the training period may have developed very task specific strategies, which obviously boosts n-back performance, but may prevent transfer because these strategies remain too task-specific (5, 20). The averaged n-back level in the last session is therefore not critical to predicting a gain in _Gf_; rather, it seems that working at the capacity limit promotes transfer to _Gf_."

Mailing list members [report benefits](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/eacf724158e04506) even if they have plateaued at 3 or 4-back.

## I heard 12-back is possible

Some users have reported being able to go all the way up to 13-back.

Ashirgo [offers up](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/72aa2de2fdf75edf/6c777b2646227c38?q) her 8-point scheme as to how to accomplish such feats:

> 1. 'Be focused at all cost. The fluid intelligence itself is sometimes called "the strength of focus".
> 2. You had better not rehearse the last position/sound . It will eventually decrease your performance! I mean the rehearsal "step by step": it will slow you down and distract. The only rehearsal allowed should be nearly unconscious and "effortless" (you will soon realize its meaning :)
> 3. Both points 1 & 2 thus imply that you must be focused on the most current stimulus as strongly as you can. Nevertheless, you cannot forget about the previous stimuli. How to do that? You should hold the image of them (image, picture, drawing, whatever you like) in your mind. Notice that you still do not rehearse anything that way.
> 4. Consider dividing the stream of data (n) on smaller parts. 6-back will be then two 3-back, for instance.
> 5. Follow square with your eyes as it changes its position.
> 6. Just turn on the Jaeggi mode with all the options to ensure your task is closest to the original version.
> 7. Consider doing more than 20 trials. I am on my way to do no less than 30 today. It may also help.
> 8. You may lower the difficulty by reducing the fall-back and advance levels from >75 and =<90 to 70 and 85 respectively (for instance).'

## Does it really work?

### N-back improves working memory
<!-- TODO: add more studies -->

There are quite a few studies showing significant increases in working memory. WM is something that can be trained. See for example ["Changes in cortical activity after training of working memory - a single-subject analysis."](http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:17597168) or ["Increased prefrontal and parietal activity after training of working memory"](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n1/abs/nn1165.html).

### Measuring with IQ tests

Because N-back is supposed to improve your pure '[fluid intelligence](!Wikipedia)' (_Gf_), and not, say, your English vocabulary, the most accurate tests for seeing whether N-back has done anything are going to be ones that avoid vocabulary or literature or tests of subject-area knowledge. That is, 'culture-neutral' IQ tests. (A non-neutral test focuses more on your 'crystallized intelligence', while N-back is supposed to affect 'fluid intelligence'; they do affect each other a little but it's better to test fluid intelligence with a fluid intelligence test.)

As one ML member writes:

> "The WAIS test involves crystallized intelligence and is unsuitable for judging fluid intelligence. High working memory will not spawn the ability to solve complex mathematical and verbal problems on its own, you have to put your extended capacity to learning. All very-high-level IQ tests are largely crystallized IQ tests, therefore working memory gains will not be immediately apparent by their measure."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904)

The gold-standard of culture-neutral IQ tests is [Raven's progressive matrices](!Wikipedia). Unfortunately, Raven's is not available for free online, but there are a number of clones one can use - bearing in mind their likely inaccuracy, and remembering that if you are testing at the beginning and end of your training there is probably going to be a [practice effect](!Wikipedia). They are:

If Raven-style tests bore you or you've gone through the previous ones, there are a wealth of difficult tests at Miyaguchi's ["Uncommonly Difficult IQ Tests"](http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/).

### IQ test results

Reports of IQ tests have been mixed. Some results have been stunning:

> "LSaul [posted about](http://groups.google.ca/group/dualnback/browse_thread/thread/97b2340497476ecc/9959b6da18f8fbea) his apparent rise in IQ back in October. From what I remember, he had recently failed to qualify for MENSA, which requires a score of about 131 (98th percentile). He then got a 151 (99.97th percentile) on a professionally administered IQ test (WAIS) three months later, after 2 months of regular dual-n-back use." --[MR](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904)

Some have not:

> "I took the Online Denmark IQ test again [after N-back training] and I got 140 (the same
result)<br>
> I took a standardized (and charged) online IQ test from www.iqtest.com and I got 134 (though it may be a bit higher because English is not my mother tongue)" --[Crypto](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904/c397c36355355d4c)

Tofu [writes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d1e53e8c69c95c3a):

> "I've purposely not been doing anything to practice for the tests or anything else I thought could increase my score so I wouldn't have to factor other things into an improvement in iq, which makes improvements more likely attributable to dual n-back.  Before I took the test I scored at 117, a score about 1 in about 8 people can get (7.78 to be exact), and yesterday I scored at 127 (a score that 1 in 28 people would get).  Its a pretty big difference I would say."

Keep in mind, that if IQ is improved, that doesn't necessarily mean anything unless one employs it to some end. It would be a shame to boost one's IQ through N-back, but never use it because one was too busy playing!

### Benefits

[Jack Nguyen asked](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/14c843162167c376) what benefits people saw from N-back use. The responses (and quotes from other threads) are, of course, entirely anecdotal, so take them as you will.

- Ashirgo: "To be honest, I do not feel any obvious difference. There are moments in which I perceive a significant improvement, though, as well as particulars task which are much easier now." "I have also experienced better dream recalling, with all these reveries and other hallucinations included ;) I am more happier now than ever. I did doubt it would be ever possible! I am also more prone to get excited...Now people in my motherland are just boring to listen to. They speak too slow and seem as though it took them pains to express anything. I did not notice that after I had done my first ninety days of n-back, but now (after 2.5 months) it is just conspicuous."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)

- chinmi04: "For me, it definitely has taught me how to focus. But I'm still not sure whether that has something to do with merely coming to realize the importance of focusing, or whether the program has really physically rewired my brain to focus better. In any case, it appears that I'm now faster at mental reasoning, creative thinking and speaking fluency. But again, the effects are not so clear as to completely eliminate any doubt regarding the connection with the n-back program." "I have been maintaining a personal blog on wordpress since 3 years ago. Average post per month : a little over 1. Then I started with dual-n-back at the end of november... number of posts in January : 7! (none are about n-back)"
- Confuzedd: "[asked if felt 'sharper']: Nothing."
- ArseneLupin: "Not much, yet, but I feel that I can easier get a hold of a discussion. The feeling is the same as when I am mastering a certain n-back in the game (a bit hard to explain)."
- John: "I feel much sharper since I started in the middle of last November...My productivity is much higher these days. I'm a non-fiction writer, so having a higher working memory and fluid intelligence directly leads to better (and faster) performance. It's amazing to see the stuff I produce today and compare it to before I began the Dual N-Back training. Also, I am simultaneously learning German, French and Spanish, and I'm certain this is helping me learn those languages faster."
- Ginkgo: "DN-Back has probably helped me with one of my hobbies."
- BamaDoc: "I note a subjective difference in recall.  There might be some increase in attention, but I certainly do notice a difference in recall.  It might be placebo, but I am convinced enough that I continue to find time to use the program."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/f11ff07eb9eba1a4)
- karnautrahl: "Since November however, I began to read the Neuroscience book in more detail. I mentioned late December I think that I was finding I could understand more stuff. I've spent about £1000 on books since November. The large majority are books on the brain, source from Amazon reviews, reading lists and out of my own pirate list when I liked a book. I stopped Dual n Back in December, early. The benefits have stayed however. I tested this the other day, very easily going to 3 n back, which was mostly where I was before. I guess in a way I'm trying to say that for me, whilst the focus may have been on G increase and IQ etc, now the focus is on--what's *really* happened and what can I do with it :). What I can do with it is choose to concentrate long enough to genuinely understand fairly technical in depth chapters on subjects often new to me."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c) "After not using this since around December last year, I still attribute my vastly improved concentration to DNB training...Some are degree textbooks or for med school students. I'm having no real trouble working through any of these....This isn't a case of how smart I became because I definitely have no comparison for this as I'm not on a course nor am I eligible for any degree placements at this time. What it is though, is my own personal testimony as to how much greater concentration I have than I ever had."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/a9e8c326d95f0da6)
- negatron: "One perhaps coincidental thing I noticed is that dream recollection went up substantially. A good while after I stopped I developed an odd curiosity for what I previously considered unpleasant material, such as advanced mathematics. Never imagined I'd consider the thought of advanced calculus exciting. I began reading up on such subjects far more frequently than I used to. This was well after I've long forgotten about dual n-back so I find it hard to attribute it to a placebo effect, believing that I'm more adapted to this material. On the other hand I don't recall reading anything about motivational benefits to dual n-back training so I still consider this conjecture and perhaps an eventful coincidence just the same."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c)
- Chris: "One thing I have noticed is the recollection of a number of very unpleasant images in dreams. Specifically, images of bodily disease, mutilation, injury and post-mortem decomposition. I find it difficult to believe it's just a coincidence, because I can't remember when I last had such a dream, and I've had maybe half a dozen since I started dual n-back. But perhaps it's simply owing to better recall."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c)
- sutur: "i didn't really notice any concrete changes in my thinking process, which probably, if existent, are rather hard to detect reliably anyway. one thing i did notice however is an increased sense of calmness. i used to move my legs around an awful lot while sitting which i now don't feel the urge to anymore. but of course this could be placebo or something else entirely. i also seem to be able to read text (in books or on screen) more fluently now with less danger of distraction. however, personally i am quite skeptic when people describe the changes they notice. changes in cognitive capacity are probably quite subtle, build up slowly and are hard to notice through introspection."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)
- astriaos: "By 'robust', I mean practically everything I do is qualitatively different from how I did things 30 days previous to the dual n-back training. For instance, in physics class I went from vaguely understanding most of the concepts covered in class to a mastery thorough enough that now my questions usually transcend the scope of the in-class and textbook material, routinely stupefying my physics teacher into longer-than-average pauses. It's the same experience for all of my classes. Somehow, I've learned more-than-I usually learn of physics/government/ etc. (all of my classes, and any topic in general) information from sources outside of class, and without what I consider significant effort. I feel like my learning speed has gone up by some factor greater than 1; I can follow longer arguments with greater precision; my vocabulary has improved; I can pay attention longer; my problem solving skills are significantly better... Really, it's amazing how much cognition depends on attention!"[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)

# What's some relevant research?

The main Jaeggi studies (2003, and 2008) are available in the Group's [Files](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/files) folder, as is the McNab 2009 study showing physical changes to dopamine neurochemistry after N-back training.

- ["Training and transfer effects of executive functions in preschool
children"](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/Thorell2008.pdf):

> "Executive functions, including working memory and inhibition, are of central importance to much of human behavior. Interventions intended to improve executive functions might therefore serve an important purpose. Previous studies show that working memory can be improved by training, but it is unknown if this also holds for inhibition, and whether it is possible to train executive functions in preschoolers. In the present study, preschool children received computerized training of either visuo-spatial working memory or inhibition for 5 weeks. An active control group played commercially available computer games, and a passive control group took part in only pre- and posttesting. Children trained on working memory improved significantly on trained tasks; they showed training effects on non-trained tests of spatial and verbal working memory, as well as transfer effects to attention. Children trained on inhibition showed a significant improvement over time on two out of three trained task paradigms, but no significant improvements relative to the control groups on tasks measuring working memory or attention. In neither of the two interventions were there effects on non-trained inhibitory tasks. The results suggest that working memory training can have significant effects also among preschool children. The finding that inhibition could not be improved by either one of the two training programs might be due to the particular training program used in the present study or possibly indicate that executive functions differ in how easily they can be improved by training, which in turn might relate to differences in their underlying psychological and neural processes."

- ["Common and unique components of inhibition and working memory: An fMRI, within-subjects investigation"](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/McNab2008.pdf)

> "Behavioural findings indicate that the core executive functions of inhibition and working memory are closely linked, and neuroimaging studies indicate overlap between their neural correlates. There has not, however, been a comprehensive study, including several inhibition tasks and several working memory tasks, performed by the same subjects. In the present study, 11 healthy adult subjects completed separate blocks of 3 inhibition tasks (a stop task, a go/no-go task and a flanker task), and 2 working memory tasks (one spatial and one verbal). Activation common to all 5 tasks was identified in the right inferior frontal gyrus, and, at a lower threshold, also the right middle frontal gyrus and right parietal regions (BA 40 and BA 7). Left inferior frontal regions of interest (ROIs) showed a significant conjunction between all tasks except the flanker task. The present study could not pinpoint the specific function of each common region, but the parietal region identified here has previously been consistently related to working memory storage and the right inferior frontal gyrus has been associated with inhibition in both lesion and imaging studies. These results support the notion that inhibitory and working memory tasks involve common neural components, which may provide a neural basis for the interrelationship between the two systems."

> "Recent functional neuroimaging evidence suggests a bottleneck between learning new information and remembering old information. In two behavioral experiments and one functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, we tested the hypothesis that learning and remembering compete when both processes happen within a brief period of time. In the first behavioral experiment, participants intentionally remembered old words displayed in the foreground, while incidentally learning new scenes displayed in the background. In line with a memory competition, we found that remembering old information was associated with impaired learning of new information. We replicated this finding in a subsequent fMRI experiment, which showed that this behavioral effect was coupled with a suppression of learning-related activity in visual and medial temporal areas. Moreover, the fMRI experiment provided evidence that left mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in resolving the memory competition, possibly by facilitating rapid switching between learning and remembering. Critically, a follow-up behavioral experiment in which the background scenes were replaced with a visual target detection task provided indications that the competition between learning and remembering was not merely due to attention. This study not only provides novel insight into our capacity to learn and remember, but also clarifies the neural mechanisms underlying flexible behavior."

["Gaining control: training executive function and far transfer of the ability to resolve interference"](http://www2.psychology.su.se/staff/jpn/papers/PerssonJ_PsychologicalScience_2008.pdf). Persson J, Reuter-Lorenz PA:

> "Functional brain-imaging data document overlapping sites of activation in prefrontal cortex across memory tasks, suggesting that these tasks may share common executive components. We leveraged this evidence to develop a training regimen and a set of transfer tasks to examine the trainability of a putative executive-control process: interference resolution. Eight days of training on high-interference versions of three different working memory tasks increased the efficiency with which proactive interference was resolved on those particular tasks. Moreover, an improved ability to resolve interference was also transferred to different working memory, semantic memory, and episodic memory tasks, a demonstration of far-transfer effects from process-specific training. Participants trained with noninterference versions of the tasks did not exhibit transfer. We infer that the transfer we demonstrated resulted from increased efficiency of the interference-resolution process. Therefore, this aspect of executive control is plastic and adaptive, and can be improved by training."

> "On the basis of the executive-attention theory of working memory capacity (WMC; e.g., M. J. Kane, A. R. A. Conway, D. Z. Hambrick, & R. W. Engle, 2007), the authors tested the relations among WMC, mind wandering, and goal neglect in a sustained attention to response task (SART; a go/no-go task). In 3 SART versions, making conceptual versus perceptual processing demands, subjects periodically indicated their thought content when probed following rare no-go targets. SART processing demands did not affect mind-wandering rates, but mind-wandering rates varied with WMC and predicted goal-neglect errors in the task; furthermore, mind-wandering rates partially mediated the WMC-SART relation, indicating that WMC-related differences in goal neglect were due, in part, to variation in the control of conscious thought."

The program used in the Jaeggi studies, [Brain Twister](http://www.apn.psy.unibe.ch/content/application/braintwister), is available to the public. You can get something very similar to the commercial game by enabling 'Jaeggi mode' in the data/config.ini file, by editing the `JAEGGI_MODE = False` field.

Other commercial programs include 'Soak Your Head' or 'Brain Fitness Pro'. Given prices like €40, though, they'd have to be awfully good to beat BW's free.

# What else can I do?

Forum members have recommended a number of other things for general mental fitness.

- Buddhist-style meditation has been recommended (there is a good Vipassana textbook available online; see ["Mindfulness in Plain English"](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html), and the <http://openfocus.com/> website has been mentioned).
- [Spaced repetition](!Wikipedia) programs such as [Mnemosyne](!Wikipedia "Mnemosyne (software)") are very useful for memorizing & remembering things
- Crypto [recommends](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904) [image streaming](!Wikipedia) as another mental exercise
- Exercise is right up there with nutrition and sleep!
