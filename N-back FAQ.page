# What is N-back anyway?

It's [mental training](!Wikipedia "Working memory training") intended to expand your [working memory](!Wikipedia) (WM), and hopefully your intelligence^[By IQ, I mean fluid intelligence, not crystallized intelligence, since it's unlikely that any generic training would teach you Latinate vocabulary terms or middle-school geometry.].

The theory originally went that WM predicts and correlates with IQ very well^[See for example ["Do working memory and susceptibility to interference predict individual differences in fluid intelligence?"](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a757621823), Borella 2006; WM predicts IQ better than strong focus/attention. Available in Group Files] and may well use the same neural networks[^fmri] to the extent that WM might very well *be* IQ.

Later research found that performance and improvement on N-back (especially Single N-back) seems to correlate better with IQ rather than classic measures of WM like reciting lists of numbers, raising the question of whether N-back works via increasing WM or by improving self-control or improving manipulation of WM contents (rather than WM's size) or somehow training IQ directly.[^jaeggi2010] (And the link between WM and performance on IQ tests has been disputed; high WM as measured by OSPAN does not correlate well with performance on hard Raven's questions[^unsworth] and the validity of single tests of WM training has been questioned[^shipstead].)

(Brain Workshop offers many modes, some far more elaborate than simple Dual N-back; no research has been done on them, so little can be said about what they are good for or what they train or what improvements they may offer. Some of the more elaborate modes seem to focus heavily on shifting the correct response among various modalities - not just sound, but left/right, eg. - and so stress [context switches](!Wikipedia "Task switching (psychology)"); there are results that task switching can be trained and that it transfers[^switching], but how useful this is and how well the BW modes train this are unknown. The more possible stimuli, the less difference between them, and the more precise one's mental representation needs to be to compare them; precision of WM items doesn't seem to correlate with IQ, but number of WM items^[["Clarity in Short-Term Memory Shows No Link With IQ"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101129121123.htm)])

## The Argument

[Working memory is important stuff](!Wikipedia "Working memory#Working memory and learning") for learning and also just general intelligence.[^jaeggi][^nyt] It's not too hard to see why working memory could be so important. Working memory boils down to 'how much stuff you can think about at the same time'.

Imagine a poor programmer who has suffered brain damage and has only enough working memory for 1 definition at a time. How could he write anything? To write a correct program, he needs to know simultaneously 2 things - what a variable, say, contains, and what is valid input for a program. But unfortunately, our programmer can know that the variable `foo` contains a string with the input, or he can know that the function `processInput` uses a string, but he can't remember these 2 things simultaneously! He will deadlock forever, unsure either what to do with this `foo`, or unsure what exactly `processInput` was supposed to work on.

More seriously, working memory can be useful since it allows one to grasp more of the structure of something at any one time. Commentators on programming write that one of the great challenges of programming^[Besides the challenge of accepting & dealing with the reality that a computer really is just a mindless rule-following machine; that can be hard, though, which is why [the camel has 2 humps.](http://www.google.com/search?q=the camel has two humps)], is that programming requires one to keep in mind dozens of things and circumstances - any one of which could completely bollix things up. Focus is absolutely essential. One of the characteristics of great programmers is their apparent omniscience. Obsession grants them this ability to *know what they are actually doing*:

> "With programmers, it's especially hard. Productivity depends on being able to juggle a lot of little details in short term memory all at once. Any kind of interruption can cause these details to come crashing down. When you resume work, you can't remember any of the details (like local variable names you were using, or where you were up to in implementing that search algorithm) and you have to keep looking these things up, which slows you down a lot until you get back up to speed."[^spolsky]

### The Silver Bullet

It's not all that obvious, but just about every productivity innovation in computing is about either cutting down on how much a programmer needs to know (eg. [garbage collection](!Wikipedia "Garbage collection (computer science)"), or making it easier for him to shuffle things in and out of his 'short term memory'.  Why are some commentators like [Jeff Atwood](!Wikipedia) so focused[^atwood] on having multiple [monitors](!Wikipedia "Visual display unit")? For that matter, why *are* there real studies showing surprisingly large productivity boosts by simply adding a second monitor?^[See citation roundup at the [Skeptics StackExchange](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1700/does-more-monitor-real-estate-really-increase-productivity/1701#1701).] It's not like the person is any different afterwards. And arguably multiple or larger monitors come with damaging overheads[^atwood2].

Or, why does [Steve Yegge](!Wikipedia) think touch-typing is one of the few skills programmers *must* know (along with reading)?[^yegge] Why is Unix guru [Ken Thompson](!Wikipedia)'s one regret not learning typing?[^thompson] Typing hardly seems very important - it's what you say, not how you say it. The compiler doesn't care if you typed the source code in at 30WPM or 120WPM, after all.

> "I love being able to type that without looking! It's _empowering_, being able to type almost as fast as you can think. Why would you want it any other way?"

[^thompson]: Page 457, _Coders at Work_:

    > Seibel: "Is there anything you would have done differently about learning to program? Do you have any regrets about the sort of path you took or do you wish you had done anything earlier?"
    >
    > Ken Thompson: "Oh, sure, sure. In high school I wish I’d taken typing. I suffer from poor typing yet today, but who knew. I didn't plan anything or do anything. I have no discipline. I did what I wanted to do next, period, all the time. If I had some foresight or planning or something, there are things, like typing, I would have done when I had the chance."

The thing is, multiple monitors, touch-typing - they're all about making the external world part of your mind. What's the real difference between having a [type signature](!Wikipedia) in your short-term memory or prominently displayed in your second monitor? What's the *real* difference between writing a [comment](!Wikipedia "Comment (computer programming)") in your mind or touch-typing it as fast as you create it?

Just some speed. Just some time. And the more visible that type signature is, the faster you can type out that comment, the larger your 'memory' gets. And the larger your memory is, the more intelligent/productive you can be. (Think of this as the [Extended Mind](!Wikipedia "Extended Mind") thesis as applied to programming!) Great programmers often[^codersatwork] talk vaguely about 'keeping a system in your head' or 'having a model'; I think what they are talking about is trying to store all the relevant details inside their short-term or working memory. (Once you start looking, you see this everywhere. Games, for example.[^angrybirds])

[^angrybirds]: In ["Why Angry Birds is so successful and popular: a cognitive teardown of the user experience"](http://www.mauronewmedia.com/blog/2011/02/why-angry-birds-is-so-successful-a-cognitive-teardown-of-the-user-experience/), [ergonomics](!Wikipedia) writer Charles L. Mauro singles out selective stressing of working memory as key to _[Angry Birds](!Wikipedia)_'s management of the difficulty of its puzzles:

    > "It is a well-known fact of cognitive science that human short-term memory (SM), when compared to other attributes of our memory systems, is exceedingly limited....Where things get interesting is the point where poor user interface design impacts the demand placed on SM. For example, a user interface design solution that requires the user to view information on one screen, store it in short-term memory, and then reenter that same information in a data field on another screen seems like a trivial task. Research shows that it is difficult to do accurately, especially if some other form of stimulus flows between the memorization of the data from the first screen and before the user enters the data in the second. This disruptive data flow can be in almost any form, but as a general rule, anything that is engaging, such as conversation, noise, motion, or worst of all, a combination of all three, is likely to totally erase SM. When you encounter this type of data flow before you complete transfer of data using short-term memory, chances are very good that when you go back to retrieve important information from short-term memory, it is gone!
    >
    > ..._Angry Birds_ is a surprisingly smart manager of the player’s short-term memory.
    >
    > By simple manipulation of the user interface, _Angry Birds_ designers created significant short-term memory loss, which in turn increases game play complexity but in a way that is not perceived by the player as negative and adds to the addictive nature of the game itself. The subtle, yet powerful concept employed in _Angry Birds_ is to bend short-term memory but not to actually break it. If you do break SM, make sure you give the user a very simple, fast way to accurately reload. There are many examples in the _Angry Birds_ game model of this principle in action....
    >
    > One of the main benefits of playing _Angry Birds_ on the iPad [rather than the smaller iPhone] is the ability to pinch down the window size so you can keep the entire game space (birds & pigs in houses) in full view all the time. Keeping all aspects of the game’s interface in full view prevents short-term memory loss and improves the rate at which you acquire skills necessary to move up to a higher game level.
    > Side note: If you want the ultimate _Angry Birds_ experience use a POGO pen on the iPad with the display pinched down to view the entire game space. This gives you finer control, better targeting and rapidly changing game play. The net impact in cognitive terms is a vastly superior skill acquisition profile. However, you will also find that the game is less interesting to play over extended periods. Why does this happen?"

But as great as things like garbage collection & touch-typing & multiple monitors are (I am a fan & user of the foregoing), they are still imperfect substitutes. Wouldn't it be better if one could just improve one's short-term/working memory directly? It might be more effective, and certainly would be more portable!

## Training

Unfortunately, in general, IQ/[_g_](!Wikipedia "General intelligence factor") and memory don't seem to be trainable. Many apparent effects are swamped by exercise or nutrition or by simple practice. And when practice does result in gains on tasks or expensive games^["Walking is free, but Americans spent $13 million on brain-fitness software and games last year [2009]..."; from _[Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/18/this-is-your-brain-aging.print.html)_], said benefits often do not [_transfer_](!Wikipedia "Transfer of learning"); many popular 'brain games' & exercises fail this criterion or at least have not been shown to transfer^[See for example _Nature_'s coverage of the Cambridge study, ["No gain from brain training: Computerized mental workouts don't boost mental skills, study claims"](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100420/full/4641111a.html).] [^newsweekactive][^newsweeksalthouse]

[^newsweekactive]: [_Newsweek_](http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/03/can-you-build-a-better-brain.html):

    > "Training your memory, reasoning, or speed of processing improves that skill, found a large government-sponsored study called Active. Unfortunately, there is no transfer: improving processing speed does not improve memory, and improving memory does not improve reasoning. Similarly, doing crossword puzzles will improve your ability to...do crosswords. “The research so far suggests that cognitive training benefits only the task used in training and does not generalize to other tasks,” says Columbia’s Stern."
[^newsweeksalthouse]:  ["This Is Your Brain. Aging. Science is reshaping what we know about getting older. (The news is better than you think.)"](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/18/this-is-your-brain-aging.print.html), _Newsweek_:

    > "Doing crossword puzzles would seem to be ideal brain exercise since avid puzzlers do them daily and say it keeps them mentally sharp, especially with vocabulary and memory. But this may be confusing cause and effect. It is mostly people who are good at figuring out "Dole’s running mate" who do crosswords regularly; those who aren’t, don’t. In a recent study, Salt-house and colleagues found "no evidence" that people who do crosswords have "a slower rate of age-related decline in reasoning." As he put it in a 2006 analysis, there is "little scientific evidence that engagement in mentally stimulating activities alters the rate of mental aging," an idea that is "more of an optimistic hope than an empirical reality." (P.S.: Bob Dole’s 1996 VP choice was Jack Kemp.)"

But there are a few exceptions. The one this FAQ focuses on is called Dual [N-back](!Wikipedia), and it's a variant on an old working-memory test.

One of the nice things about N-back is that while it may or [may not](#criticism) improve your IQ, it may help you in other ways. The self-discipline or willpower of students correlates far better with grades than even IQ[^discipline], and WM training has been shown to help children with ADHD[^klingberg] and also preschoolers without ADHD^[["Training and transfer effects of executive functions in preschool children"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19120418), Thorell et al, _Dev. Sci._ 2009 Jan;12(1):106-13].

### N-back

The original N-back test simply asked that you remember a stream of letters, and signal if any letters were precisely, say, 2 positions apart. 'A S S R' wouldn't merit a signal, but '_A_ S _A_ R' would since there are 'A' characters exactly 2 positions away from each other. The program would give you another letter, you would signal or not, and so on. This is simple enough.

### Dual N-back

In 2003, Susan Jaeggi and her team began [fMRI](!Wikipedia "Functional magnetic resonance imaging") studies using a variant of N-back which tried to increase the burden on each turn - remembering multiple things instead of just 1. The abstract describes the reason why:

> "With reference to single tasks, activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) commonly increases with incremental memory load, whereas for dual tasks it has been hypothesized previously that activity in the PFC decreases in the face of excessive processing demands, i.e., if the capacity of the working memory’s central executive system is exceeded. However, our results show that during both single and dual tasks, prefrontal activation increases continuously as a function of memory load. An increase of prefrontal activation was observed in the dual tasks even though processing demands were excessive in the case of the most difficult condition, as indicated by behavioral accuracy measures. The hypothesis concerning the decrease in prefrontal activation could not be supported and was discussed in terms of motivation factors."[^jaeggi2003]

In this version, called 'dual N-back' (to distinguish it from the classic N-back), one is still playing a turn-based game. In the [Brain Workshop](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/) version, you are presented with a 3x3 grid in which every turn, a block appears in 1 of the 9 spaces and a letter is spoken aloud.[^details]

#### 1-back

In 1-back, the task is to correctly answer whether the *letter* is the same as the previous round, and whether the *position* is the same as the previous round. It can be both, making 4 possible responses (position, sound, position+sound, & neither).

This stresses working memory since you need to keep in mind 4 things simultaneously: the position and letter of the previous turn, and the position and letter of the current turn (so you can compare the current letter with the old letter and the current position with the old position). Then on the next turn you need to immediately forget the old position & letter (which are now useless) and remember the new position and letter. So you are constantly remembering and forgetting and comparing.

#### 2-back

But 1-back is pretty easy. The turns come fast enough that you could easily keep the letters in your [phonological loop](!Wikipedia "Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop") and lighten the load on your working memory. Indeed, after 10 rounds or so of 1-back, I mastered it - I now get 100%, unless I forget for a second that it's 1-back and not 2-back (or I simply lose my concentration completely). Most people find 1-back very easy to learn, although a bit challenging at first since the pressure is constant (games and tests usually have some slack or rest periods).

The next step up is a doozy: 2-back. In 2-back, you do the same thing as 1-back but as the name suggests, you are instead matching against *2* turns ago. So before you would be looking for repeated letters - 'AA' - but now you need to look for separated letters - 'ABA'. And of course, you can't forget so quickly, since you still need to match against something like 'ABABA'.

2-back stresses your working memory even more, as now you are remembering 6 things, not 4: 2 turns ago, the previous turn, and the current turn - all of which have 2 salient features. (At 6 items, we're also in the mid-range of estimates for normal working memory capacity.[^size])

And even if there are only a few things to remember, the number of responses you have to choose between go up exponentially with how many 'modes' there are, so Triple N-back has not $\frac{1}{3}$ more possible responses than Dual N-back, but more than twice as many: if _m_ is the number of modes, then the number of possible responses is $2^m - 1$^[The $-1$ is there because one can nothing in every mode, but that's boring and requires no choice or thought.], so DNB has 3 possible responses[^math], while TNB has 7^[or 2^3^ - 1], Quadruple N-back 15^[or 2^4^ - 1], and Quintuple N-back 31^[or 2^5^ - 1]!

Worse, the temporal gap between elements is deeply confusing. It's particularly bad when there's repetition involved - if the same square is selected twice with the same letter, you might wind up forgetting both!

So 2-back is where the challenge first really manifests. After about 20 games I started to get the hang of it. (It helped to play a few games focusing only on one of the stimuli, like the letters; this helps you get used to the 'reaching back' of 2-back.)

### Personal reflection on results

Have I seen any benefits yet? Not really. Thus far it's like meditation: I haven't seen any specific improvements, but it's been interesting just to explore concentration - I've learned that my ability to focus is much less than I thought it was!^[It is very sobering to get 30% scores on something as trivial as 1-back.] Besides the intrinsic interest of changing one's brain through a simple exercise - meditation is equally interesting for how one's mind refuses to cooperate with the simple work of meditating, and I understand that there are even vivid hallucinations at the higher levels - N-back might function as a kind of mental calisthenics. Few people exercise and stretch because they find the activities intrinsically valuable, but they serve to further some other goal; some people jog because they just enjoy running, but many more jog so they can play soccer better or live longer. I am young, and it's good to explore these sorts of calisthenics while one has a long life ahead of one; then one can reap the most benefits.

<!--
Not long after starting N-back, while still at 2-back, I did the iqtest.dk and was scored at 115. This may not be particularly accurate (I was hungry, and haven't taken such a test in at least a decade), but that's what I got. I plan to retest in a few months. Hopefully I will have forgotten enough about the .dk test (the questions don't change, alas) that a second time through won't be too inaccurate.

Note to self: I started taking piracetam on 13 September during a N-back break. I currently peaking at 60% on 5-back as of 14 September. The above IQ test was in the middle of February. TODO: attach my stats file?
-->

## Terminology

N-back training is sometimes referred to simply as 'N-backing', and participants in such training are called 'N-backers'. Almost everyone uses the Free, featureful & portable program [Brain Workshop](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/), abbreviated "BW" (but see [the software section](#software) for alternatives).

There are many variants of N-back training. A 3-letter acronym ending in 'B' specifies one of the possibilities. For example, 'D2B' and 'D6B' both refer to a dual N-back task, but in the former the depth of recall is 2 turns, while in the latter one must remember back 6 rounds; the 'D', for 'Dual', indicates that each round presents 2 stimuli (usually the position of the square, and a spoken letter).

But one can add further stimuli: spoken letter, position of square, and *color* of square. That would be 'Triple N-back', and so one might speak of how one is doing on 'T4B'.

One can go further. Spoken letter, position, color, and *geometric shape*. This would be 'Quad N-back', so one might discuss one's performance on 'Q3B'. (It's unclear how to compare the various modes, but it seems to be much harder to go from D2B to T3B than to go from D2B to D3B.)

Past QNB, there is Pentuple N-back (PNB) which was added in Brain Workshop 4.7; one can see a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efSxgA7EpGk) of it. The 5th modality is added by a second audio channel - that is, now sounds are in stereo.

Other abbreviations are in common use: 'WM' for 'working memory', '_Gf_' for '[fluid intelligence](!Wikipedia)', and '_g_' for the [general intelligence factor](!Wikipedia "General intelligence factor") measured by IQ tests.

# Notes from the author

## N-back in general

To those whose time is limited: you may wish to stop reading here. If you seek to improve your life, and want the greatest 'bang for the buck', you are well-advised to look elsewhere.

Meditation, for example, is easier, faster, and ultra-portable. Typing training will directly improve your facility with a computer, a valuable skill for this modern world. [Spaced repetition](!Wikipedia) memorization techniques offer unparalleled advantages to students. [Nootropics](!Wikipedia) are the epitome of ease (just swallow!), and their effects are much more easily assessed - one can even run double-blind experiments on oneself, impossible with dual N-back. Other supplements like [melatonin](!Wikipedia) can deliver benefits incommensurable with DNB - what is the cognitive value of another number in working memory thanks to DNB compared to a good night's sleep thanks to melatonin? Modest changes to one's diet and environs can fundamentally improve one's wellbeing. Even basic training in reading, with the crudest [tachistoscope](!Wikipedia) techniques, can pay large dividends if one is below a basic level of reading like 200[WPM](!Wikipedia) & still subvocalizing. And all of these can start paying off immediately.

DNB, on the other hand, requires a minimum of 15 hours before one can expect genuine somatic improvements. The task itself is unproven - the Jaeggi studies are suggestive, not definitive (and there are [contrary results](#criticism)). Programs for DNB training rely essentially on guesswork as they explore the large design-space; there are no data on what features are essential, what sort of presentation optimal, or even how long or when to train for. The task itself is unenjoyable. It can be wearying, difficult & embarrassing. It can be one too many daily tasks, a straw which breaks the camel's back, and a distraction from whatever activity has the greatest [marginal utility](!Wikipedia) for one[^charity] and one ought to be doing instead.

So why then do I persevere with DNB?

I do it because I find it fascinating. Fascinating that WM can be so large a part of IQ; fascinating that it can be increased by an apparently trivial exercise. I'm fascinated that there are measurable gross changes in brain activity & chemistry & composition^[see eg. [McNab](#whats-some-relevant-research)] - that the effects are not purely 'mental' or placebo. I'm fascinated by how the sequence of positions and letters can at some times appear in my mind with boundless lucidity, yet at other times I grope confused in a mental murk unsure of even what the last position/letter was - even though I can rise from my computer and go about normal activities normally; or with how time can stretch and compress during N-backing[^time]. I'm fascinated by how a single increase in _n_-level can render the task nightmarishly difficult when I just finished _n-1_ at 90 or 100%. I'm fascinated by how saccading, another apparently trivial exercise, can reliably boost my score by 10 or 20%, and how my mind seems to be fagged after just a few rounds but recovers within minutes. I'm equally fascinated by the large literature on WM: what it is, what's it good for, how it can be manipulated, etc.

I do not think that DNB is terribly practical - but interesting? Very.

## Reading this FAQ

> `Brian`: "Look, you've got it all wrong! You don't _need_ to follow _me_, You don't _need_ to follow _anybody_! You've got to think for your selves! You're _all_ individuals!"

This FAQ is almost solely my own work. I've striven to make it fair, to incorporate most of the relevant research, and to not omit things. But inevitably I will have made errors or important omissions. You must read this skeptically.

You must read this skeptically also because the N-back community formed around the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training) *is* a community. That means it is prone to all the biases and issues of a community. One would expect a community formed around a technique or practice to be made up only of people who find value in it; any material (like this FAQ or included testimonials) is automatically suspect due to biases such as the [commitment or sunk cost bias](!Wikipedia "Escalation of commitment"). Imagine if scientists published only papers which showed new results, and no papers reporting failure to replicate! Why would any N-backer hang around who had discovered that DNB was not useful or a fraud? Certainly the fans would not thank him. ([Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia) has an excellent essay called ["Evaporative Cooling of Group Beliefs"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/) on just this topic.)

Finally, you must read skeptically because this is about psychology. Psychology is notoriously for being one of the hardest scientific fields to get solid results in, because everybody is [WEIRD](http://lesswrong.com/lw/17x/beware_of_weird_psychological_samples/) and different. As one of my professors joked, if you have 2 psychology papers reporting the same result, one of them is wrong[^peer] It's very tempting to engage in ["Generalizing From One Example"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) but you mustn't. Everybody is different; your positive (or negative) result could be due to a [placebo effect](!Wikipedia), it could be thanks to that recent shift in your sleep schedule for the better[^sleep], or that nap you took[^nap], it could be the exercise you're getting^[[Aerobic exercise](!Wikipedia) has [been shown](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/what-sort-of-exercise-can-make-you-smarter/) to improve mental fitness^[One [small study](http://journals.lww.com/jnpt/Abstract/2011/03000/Exercise_and_Executive_Function_in_Individuals.3.aspx) ([PDF](http://iris.lib.neu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=clin_ex_phys_theses)) with old diabetics found improvement in working memory/executive function caused by an aerobic exercise regimen.] (or at least [correlated](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/25/0905307106) with intelligence & education in twins), and there is some [suggestive evidence](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/phys-ed-brains-and-brawn/) that [strength training](!Wikipedia) or [resistance training](!Wikipedia) may help as well.], it could be a mild [seasonal depression](!Wikipedia "Seasonal affective disorder") lifting (or setting in), it could be a [calcium](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15w/experiential_pica/) or [zinc](!Wikipedia "Zinc deficiency")[^zinc] or [iodine deficiency](!Wikipedia "Cretinism")[^iodine], [hypoglycemia](!Wikipedia)^[["Acute hypoglycemia impairs nonverbal intelligence: importance of avoiding ceiling effects in cognitive function testing."](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15161802); [PDF](http://www.psy.ed.ac.uk/people/iand/Warren%20(2004)%20Diabetes%20Care%20raven%20alice%20heim%20hypoglycaemia.pdf)] etc.

[^peer]: Not that this problem is exclusive to psychology. Medical science in general is often on very shaky ground; see for example _[The Atlantic](!Wikipedia)_ article ["Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science"](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/8269) on [John P. A. Ioannidis](!Wikipedia)'s research showing 41% of the most famous medical research failed to be [replicated](!Wikipedia "Reproducibility") - were wrong, above and beyond the 1 or 5% one would expect from the usual [statistical significance](!Wikipedia). For details, you can see Ioannidis's ["Why Most Published Research Findings Are False"](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) or Kumar & Nash 2011's ["Health Care Myth Busters: Is There a High Degree of Scientific Certainty in Modern Medicine?"](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=demand-better-health-care-book&print=true) who write 'We could accurately say, "Half of what physicians do is wrong," or "Less than 20 percent of what physicians do has solid research to support it.' -- and then support it.

    Psychology is far from being perfect either; look at the examples in _The New Yorker_'s ["The Truth Wears Off"](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all) article (or look at some [excerpts](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/c0fe2e1f14b8af06) from that article). Computer scientist [Peter Norvig](!Wikipedia) has written a must-read essay on interpreting statistics, ["Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation"](http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html); a number of warning signs apply to many psychological studies. And the small samples of n-back studies and nootropic chemicals are especially problematic. Quoting from [Nick Bostrom](!Wikipedia) & [Anders Sandberg](!Wikipedia)'s ["Converging Cognitive Enhancements"](http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/converging.pdf) (2006):

    Particularly troubling is the [slowdown](http://innovationandgrowth.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/the-debt-crisis-and-the-human-genome/) in [drug discovery](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/business/07drug.html) & medical technology during the 2000s, even as genetics in particular was expected to produce earth-shaking new treatments. One biotech [venture capitalist](!Wikipedia) [writes](http://lifescivc.com/2011/03/academic-bias-biotech-failures/):

    > "The company spent $5M or so trying to validate a platform that didn’t exist.  When they tried to directly repeat the academic founder’s data, it never worked.  Upon re-examination of the lab notebooks, it was clear the founder’s lab had at the very least massaged the data and shaped it to fit their hypothesis.  Essentially, they systematically ignored every piece of negative data. Sadly this “failure to repeat” happens more often than we’d like to believe.  It has happened to us at Atlas [Venture] several times in the past decade...The unspoken rule is that at least 50% of the studies published even in top tier academic journals – Science, Nature, Cell, PNAS, etc… – can’t be repeated with the same conclusions by an industrial lab. In particular, key animal models often don’t reproduce.  This 50% failure rate isn’t a data free assertion: it’s backed up by dozens of experienced R&D professionals who’ve participated in the (re)testing of academic findings. This is a huge problem for translational research and one that won’t go away until we address it head on."

    Nor is peer review itself robust against even [low levels of collusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4324v1). Physicist [Michael Nielsen](!Wikipedia) [points out](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/three-myths-about-scientific-peer-review/) that peer review is historically rare (just one of Einstein's 300 papers was peer reviewed; the famous _Nature_ did not institute peer review until 1967), has been [poorly studied](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/287/21/2784) & not shown to be effective, erroneously rejects many historic discoveries (one study lists ["thirty four Nobel Laureates whose awarded work was rejected by peer review"](http://www.canonicalscience.org/publications/canonicalsciencereports/20082.html); [Horribin 1990](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/263/10/1438.abstract) lists others like the discovery of quarks), and catches only a [small fraction](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/280/3/237) of errors. And fraud? [Forget about it](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005738);

    > "A pooled weighted average of 1.97% (N = 7, 95%CI: 0.86–4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12% (N = 12, 95% CI: 9.91–19.72) for falsification, and up to 72% for other questionable research practices....When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others."

# N-back training

## Should I do multiple daily sessions, or just one?

[Most users](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e989058544ad122) seem to go for one long N-back session, pointing out that exercises one's focus. Others do one session in the morning and one in the evening so they can focus better on each one. There is some scientific support for the idea that evening sessions are better than morning sessions, though; see the [section](#sleep) on the sleep research.

If you break up sessions into more than 2, you're probably wasting time due to overhead, and may not be getting enough exercise in each session to really strain yourself like you need to.

## Strategies

The simplest mental strategy, and perhaps the most common, is to mentally think of a list, and forget the last one each round, remembering the newest in its place. This begins to break down on higher levels - if one is repeating the list mentally, the repetition can just take too long.

Surcer writes up a list of strategies for different levels in his ["My System, let's share strategies"](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/cf11964a87ed658c) thread.

### Are strategies good or bad?

People [frequently](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fd08b93399939fb9) [ask](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d779edc2b922db95) [and](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/676676a8e34f56d3) [discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/c4eaff3059759531) whether they should use some sort of strategy, and if so, what.

A number of N-backers adopt an 'intuition' strategy. Rather than explicitly rehearsing sequences of letters ('f-up, h-middle; f-up, h-middle; g-down, f-up...'), they simply think very hard and wait for a feeling that they should press 'a' (audio match), or 'l' (location match). Some, like SwedishChef can be quite vociferous [about it](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d779edc2b922db95):

> "The challenges are in helping people understand that dual-n-back is NOT about remembering n number of visual and auditory stimuli.  It's about developing a new mental process that intuitively recognizes when it has seen or heard a stimuli n times ago."
>
> "Initially, most students of dual n-back want to remember n items as fast as they can so they can conquer the dual-n-back hill.  They use their own already developed techniques to help them remember.  They may try to hold the images in their head mentally and review them every time a new image is added and say the sounds out loud and review the sounds everytime a new sound is added.  This is NOT what we want.  We want the brain to learn a new process that intuitively recognizes if an item and sound was shown 3 back or 4 back.  It's sort of like playing a new type of musical instrument.
>
> I've helped some students on the site try to understand this.  It's not about how much you can remember, it's about learning a new process.  In theory, this new process translates into a better working memory, which helps you make connections better and faster."

Other N-backers think that intuition can't work, or at least doesn't very well:

> "I don't believe that much in the "intuitive" method. I mean, sure, you can intuitively remember you heard the same letter or saw the square at the same position a few times ago, but I fail to see how you can "feel" it was exactly 6 or 7 times ago without some kind of "active" remembering." --[Gaël DEEST](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/716bd6f8c10be52e/8c9c126767d0f662)

> "I totally agree with Gaël about the intuitive method not holding much water...For me a lot of times the intuitive method can be totally unreliable. You'll be doing 5-back one game and a few games later your failing miserably at 3-back..your score all over the place. Plus, intuitive-wise, it's best to play the same n-back level over and over because then you train your intuition...and that doesn't seem right." --MikeM (same thread)

Few N-backers have systematically tracked intuitive versus strategic playing; [DarkAlrx](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1dff0955c27d25eb) reports on his [blog](http://darkmindexperiment.blogspot.com/2009/04/neurogenesis-experimentdark-side.html) the results of his experiment, and while he considers them positive, others find them inconclusive, or like Pheonexia, even unfavorable for the intuitive approach:

> "Looking at your graphs and the overall drop in your performance, I think it's clear that intuitive doesn't work. On your score sheet, the first picture, using the intuitive method over 38 days of TNB training in 44 days your average n-back increased by less than .25. You were performing much better before. With your neurogenesis experiment, your average n-back actually decreased."

Jaeggi herself was [more moderate](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/08bc4ee2ccd0df80) in ~2008:

> "I would NOT recommend you [train the visual and auditory task separately] if you want to train the dual-task (the one we used in our study). The reason is that the combination of both modalities is an entirely different task than doing both separately! If you do the task separately, I assume you use some "rehearsal strategies", e.g. you repeat the letters or positions for yourself. In the dual-task version however, these strategies might be more difficult to apply (since you have to do 2 things simultaneously...), and that is exactly what we want... We don't want to train strategies, we want to train processes. Processes that then might help you in the performance of other, non-trained tasks (and that is our ultimate goal). So, it is not important to reach a 7- or 8-back... It is important to fully focus your attention on the task as well as possible.
>
> "I can assure you, it is a very tough training regimen.... You can't divert your attention even 1 second (I'm sure you have noticed...). But eventually, you will see that you get better at it and maybe you notice that you are better able to concentrate on certain things, to remember things more easily, etc. (hopefully)."

(Unfortunately, doubt has been cast on this advice by the apparent effectiveness of *single* n-back in [Jaeggi 2010](#jaeggi-2010). If single (visual/position) n-back is effective in increasing IQ, then maybe training just audio or just visual is actually a good idea.)

> "this is a question i am being asked a lot and unfortunately, i don't really know whether i can help with that. i can only tell you what we tell (or rather not tell) our participants and what they tell us. so, first of all, we don't tell people at all what strategy to use - it is up to them. thing is, there are some people that tell us what you describe above, i.e. some of them tell us that it works best if they don't use a strategy at all and just "let the squares/letters flow by". but of course, many participants also use more conscious strategies like rehearsing or grouping items together. but again - we let people chose their strategies themselves!"[ref](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/955524caaf2e9001)

But it may make no difference. Even if you are engaged in a complex mnemonic-based strategy, you're still working your memory. Strategies may not work; quoting from Jaeggi's 2008 paper:

> "By this account, one reason for having obtained transfer between working memory and measures of _Gf_ is that our training procedure may have facilitated the ability to control attention. This ability would come about because the constant updating of memory representations with the presentation of each new stimulus requires the engagement of mechanisms to shift attention. Also, our training task discourages the development of simple task-specific strategies that can proceed in the absence of controlled allocation of attention."

Even if they do, they may not be a good idea; quoting from [Jaeggi 2010](#jaeggi-2010):

> "We also proposed that it is important that participants only minimally learn task-specific strategies in order to prevent specific skill acquisition. We think that besides the transfer to matrix reasoning, the improvement in the near transfer measure provides additional evidence that the participants trained on task-underlying processes rather than relying on material-specific strategies."

Hopefully even if a trick lets you jump from 3-back to 5-back, Brain Workshop will just keep escalating the difficulty until you are challenged again. It's not the level you reach, but the work you do.

## And the flashing right/wrong feedback?

A matter of preference, although those in favor of disabling the visual feedback (`SHOW_FEEDBACK = False`) seem to be [slightly](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/775fba46e8c163f1) [more](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/420f332fcd4317c9) vocal or numerous. Brain Twister [apparently](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/a8934cc1e04075f9) doesn't give feedback. [Jaeggi says](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/955524caaf2e9001):

> "the gaming literature also disagrees on this issue - there are different ways to think about this: whereas feedback after each trial gives you immediate feedback whether you did right or wrong, it can also be distracting as you are constantly monitoring (and evaluating) your performance. we decided that we wanted people to fully and maximally concentrate on the task itself and thus chose the approach to only give feedback at the end of the run. however, we have newer versions of the task for kids in which we give some sort of feedback (points) for each trial. thus - i can't tell you what the optimal way is - i guess there are interindividual differences and preferences as well."

[Jonathan Toomin](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/eeefb3ca685f4b7c) writes:

> "When I was doing visual psychophysics research, I heard from my labmates that this question has been investigated empirically (at least in the context of visual psychophysics), and that the consensus in the field is that using feedback reduces immediate performance but improves learning rates.  I haven't looked up the research to confirm their opinion, but it sounds plausible to me. I would also expect it to apply to Brain Workshop.  The idea, as I see it, is that feedback reduces performance because, when you get an answer wrong and you know it, your brain goes into an introspective mode to analyze the reason for the error and (hopefully) correct it, but while in this mode your brain will be distracted from the task at hand and will be more likely to miss subsequent trials."

## How can I do better on N-back?

Focus harder. Play more. Sleep well, and eat healthily. The less stressed you are, the better you can do.

### Hardcore

Curtis Warren has [noticed](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/7ec15b99a2a1a2f0) that when he underwent a 4-day routine of practicing more than 4 hours a day, he jumped an entire level on even quad N-back^["With regards to changes in n-back level, I went up about 1 solid level on all the tasks that I trained. That is, I went from 7 to 8 for dual, 6 to 7 for position-sound-color, 6 to 7 for position-sound-shape, and 4 to 5 on quad. I don't use any strategies."]:

> "For example, over the past week I have been trying a new training routine. My goal was to increase my intelligence as quickly as possible. To that end, over the past 4 days I've done a total of roughly 360 sessions @ 2 seconds per trial (= ~360 minutes of training). I had to rest on Wednesday, and I'm resting again today (I only plan on doing about 40 trials today). But I intend to finish off the week by doing 100 sessions on Saturday and another 100 on Sunday. Or more, if I can manage it."

But he cautions us that besides being a considerable time investment, it may only work for him:

> "The point is, while I can say without a doubt that this schedule has been effective _for me_, it might not be effective _for you_. Are the benefits worth the amount of work needed? Will you even notice an improvement? Is this healthy? These are all factors which depend entirely upon the individual actually _doing_ the training."

Raman started DNB training, and in his first 30 days, he "took breaks every 5 days or so, and was doing about 20-30 session each day and n-back wise I made good gains (from 2 to 7 touching 9 on the way)."; he kept a journal [on the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/9f3b791ee0fb1c38) about the experience with daily updates.

Alas, neither Raman nor Warren took an IQ or digit-span test before starting, so they can only report DNB level increases & subjective assessments.

## Plateauing, or, am I wasting time if I can't get past 4-back?

Some people start n-backing with great vigor and rapidly ascend levels until suddenly they stop improving and [panic](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/9303a95ba669742d), wondering if something is wrong with them. Not at all! Reaching a high level is a good thing, and if one does so in just a few weeks, all the more impressive since most members take much longer than, say, 2 weeks to reach good scores on D4B. In fact, if you look at the reports in the [Group survey](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/9303a95ba669742d), most reports are of plateauing at D4B or D5B months in.

The crucial thing about N-back is just that you are stressing your working memory, that's all. The actual level doesn't matter very much, just whether you can barely manage it; it is somewhat like lifting weights, in that regard. From Jaeggi 2008:

> "The finding that the transfer to _Gf_ remained even after taking the specific training effect into account seems to be counterintuitive, especially because the specific training effect is also related to training time. The reason for this capacity might be that participants with a very high level of n at the end of the training period may have developed very task specific strategies, which obviously boosts n-back performance, but may prevent transfer because these strategies remain too task-specific (5, 20). The averaged n-back level in the last session is therefore not critical to predicting a gain in _Gf_; rather, it seems that working at the capacity limit promotes transfer to _Gf_."

Mailing list members [report benefits](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/eacf724158e04506) even if they have plateaued at 3 or 4-back; see the [benefits section](#benefits).

One commonly reported tactic to break a plateauing is to deliberately advance a level (or increase modalities), and practice hard on that extra difficult task, the idea being that this will spur adaptation and make one capable of the lower level.

## Do breaks undo my work?

Some people have wondered if not n-backing for a day/week/month or other extended period undoes all their hard work, and hence n-backing may not be useful in the long-term.

Multiple group members have pointed to long gaps in their training, sometimes multiple months up to [a year](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/tree/browse_frm/thread/80613920c0fbd422/18f2a024cd8f87e8?rnum=31&_done=%2Fgroup%2Fbrain-training%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2F80613920c0fbd422%2Fb960c61b9e515755%3Ftvc%3D1%26#doc_e87c3f795821ac64), which did not change their scores significantly (immediately after the break, scores may dip a level or a few percent in accuracy, but quickly rises to the old level). Some members have ceased n-backing for 2 or 3 years, and found their scores dropped by only [2-4](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/a3e8641c0d5ff624) levels - far from 1 or 2-back. ([Pontus Granström](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/b4a99de43af6a33d), on the other hand, took a break for several months and fell for a long period from D8B-D9B to D6B-D7B; he speculates it might reflect a lack of motivation.) [huhwhat/Nova](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/b4a99de43af6a33d) fell 5 levels from D9B but recovered quickly:

> "I've been training with n-back on and off, mostly off, for the past few years. I started about 3 years ago and was able to get up to 9-n back, but on average I would be doing around 6 or 7 n back. Then I took a break for a few years. Now after coming back, even though I have had my fair share of partying, boxing, light drugs, even polyphasic sleep,  on my first few tries I was able to get back up to 5-6, and a week into it I am back at getting up to 9 n back."

This anecdotal evidence is supported by at least one [WM-training letter](http://www.casl.umd.edu/node/1331), Chrabaszcz 2010:

> "Figure 1b illustrates the degree to which training transferred to an ostensibly different (and untrained) measure of verbal working memory compared to a no-contact control group. Not only did training significantly increase verbal working memory, but these gains persisted 3 months following the cessation of training!"

Similarly, [Dahlin 2008](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/a0014296) found WM training gains which were durable over more than a year:

> "The authors investigated immediate training gains, transfer effects, and 18-month maintenance after 5 weeks of computer-based training in updating of information in working memory in young and older subjects. Trained young and older adults improved significantly more than controls on the criterion task (letter memory), and these gains were maintained 18 months later. Transfer effects were in general limited and restricted to the young participants, who showed transfer to an untrained task that required updating (3-back)..."

## I heard 12-back is possible

Some users have reported being able to go all the way up to 12-back; Ashirgo [regularly plays](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/373089e3e049707b/5dbde0450a4d44ca) at D13B, but the highest at other modes seems to be T9B and Q6B.

Ashirgo [offers up](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/72aa2de2fdf75edf/6c777b2646227c38?q) her 8-point scheme as to how to accomplish such feats:

> 1. 'Be focused at all cost. The fluid intelligence itself is sometimes called "the strength of focus".
> 2. You had better not rehearse the last position/sound . It will eventually decrease your performance! I mean the rehearsal "step by step": it will slow you down and distract. The only rehearsal allowed should be nearly unconscious and "effortless" (you will soon realize its meaning :)
> 3. Both points 1 & 2 thus imply that you must be focused on the most current stimulus as strongly as you can. Nevertheless, you cannot forget about the previous stimuli. How to do that? You should hold the image of them (image, picture, drawing, whatever you like) in your mind. Notice that you still do not rehearse anything that way.
> 4. Consider dividing the stream of data (n) on smaller parts. 6-back will be then two 3-back, for instance.
> 5. Follow square with your eyes as it changes its position.
> 6. Just turn on the Jaeggi mode with all the options to ensure your task is closest to the original version.
> 7. Consider doing more than 20 trials. I am on my way to do no less than 30 today. It may also help.
> 8. You may lower the difficulty by reducing the fall-back and advance levels from >75 and =<90 to 70 and 85 respectively (for instance).'

## Does it really work?

### N-back improves working memory
<!-- TODO: add more studies -->

There are quite a few studies showing significant increases in working memory: WM is something that can be trained. See for example ["Changes in cortical activity after training of working memory - a single-subject analysis."](http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:17597168) or ["Increased prefrontal and parietal activity after training of working memory"](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n1/abs/nn1165.html).

There are a few studies showing that DNB training enhances _Gf_; see the [support](#Support) section. There is also a study showing that WM training (not DNB) enhances _Gc_^[[Alloway 2009](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3697/version/1), ["The efficacy of working memory training in improving crystallized intelligence"](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3697/version/1/files/npre20093697-1.pdf) (PDF) 7 children with learning disabilities received the training for 8 weeks; _Gc_ was measured using the vocabulary & math sections of the Wechsler IQ test.].

### IQ Tests
#### Measuring

Because N-back is supposed to improve your pure '[fluid intelligence](!Wikipedia)' (_Gf_), and not, say, your English vocabulary, the most accurate tests for seeing whether N-back has done anything are going to be ones that avoid vocabulary or literature or tests of subject-area knowledge. That is, 'culture-neutral' IQ tests. (A non-neutral test focuses more on your 'crystallized intelligence', while N-back is supposed to affect 'fluid intelligence'; they do affect each other a little but it's better to test fluid intelligence with a fluid intelligence test.)

As one ML member writes:

> "The WAIS test involves crystallized intelligence and is unsuitable for judging fluid intelligence. High working memory will not spawn the ability to solve complex mathematical and verbal problems on its own, you have to put your extended capacity to learning. All very-high-level IQ tests are largely crystallized IQ tests, therefore working memory gains will not be immediately apparent by their measure."[ref](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904)

#### Available tests

The gold-standard of culture-neutral IQ tests is [Raven's progressive matrices](!Wikipedia). Unfortunately, Raven's is not available for free online, but there are a number of clones one can use - bearing in mind their likely inaccuracy and the fact that many of them do not randomize their questions. It's a very good idea, if you plan to n-back for a long time, to take an IQ test before and an IQ test after, both to find out whether you improved and so you can tell the rest of us. But the interval has to be a long one: if you are testing at the beginning and end of your training there is probably going to be a [practice effect](!Wikipedia) which will distort your second score upwards; it's strongly recommended you take a particular test only once, or with intervals on the order of months (and preferably years).

Other tests that might be useful include [digit-span](!Wikipedia) tests: they provide a non-dual-N-back method of measuring WM before one begins training and then after. An example Flash digit-span test: <http://www.dushkin.com/connectext/psy/ch07/digitspan.mhtml>. The [Automated Operation Span (OSPAN) Task](http://www.millisecond.com/download/samples/v3/OSPAN/) could be used as well.

#### IQ test results

Reports of IQ tests have been mixed. Some results have been stunning, others have shown nothing.

> "LSaul [posted about](http://groups.google.ca/group/dualnback/browse_thread/thread/97b2340497476ecc/9959b6da18f8fbea) his apparent rise in IQ back in October. From what I remember, he had recently failed to qualify for MENSA, which requires a score of about 131 (98th percentile). He then got a 151 (99.97th percentile) on a professionally administered IQ test (WAIS) three months later, after 2 months of regular dual-n-back use." --[MR](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904)

(A >20 point gain sounds very impressive. But possible confounding factors here are that LSaul apparently took 2 different IQ tests; besides the general incomparability of different IQ tests, it sounds as if the first test was a culture-neutral one, while the WAIS has components such as verbal tests - the second might well be 'easier' for LSaul than the first.)

The blogger of ["Inhuman Experiment"](http://inhumanexperiment.blogspot.com/), who played for ~22 days and went from ~2.6-back to ~4-back, [reports](http://inhumanexperiment.blogspot.com/2009/03/increasing-intelligence-by-playing.html):

In this one, the questions vary, the difficulty is adjusted on the go depending on whether you answer them correctly, and there's a time limit of 45 seconds per question, which makes this test better suited for re-taking. My first test, taken before playing the game, gave me a score of 126; my second test, taken yesterday, gave me a score of 132 (an increase of about 5%)....As you can see, it's kind of difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this. Yes, there was a slight increase in my score, but I would say a similar increase could've been possible even without playing the game. I think the variation in the IQ test questions reduces the "learning by heart" effect, but that's impossible to say without a control group."

I took 2 high-range tests during the last 2 months and the results were higher than I expected - my IQ was somewhere between 130 and 135 on good online tests, I scored 132 on a supervised test (Raven's SM). My results on CFNSE <http://www.etienne.se/cfnse/> and GET-γ <http://www.epiqsociety.org/get/>  were approximately 10 points higher - 6 on CFNSE (8 on my second attempt) and 21 on G.E.T) . It could be because of a flaw of these tests, or they may not test the same ability as timed tests (though the correlation between them and famous supervised timed tests is said to be very high), it may be for some other reason as well, but it could be because of TNB. I had tried CFNSE long ago and scored 0 (but I probably didn't try hard enough then)."

[argumzio](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4482aa213c8cbdf4/d1456393d7083660) reports a small increase, and offers wise words of advice to those pondering the IQ leaves:

> "In mid-March of this year, I took that High IQ society test eCMA (which is extremely reliable) and obtained a score of 143. I took it again 6 months later and scored 149, after my more intensive QNB training program that didn't last as long as I expected (I've forced myself to quit early).

In any case, it is thoroughly possible that something led to that +6 pts, but it may merely indicate that my "true IQ" lies somewhere around the two scores or it may be even higher (for one cannot outperform one's "true IQ"). It is simply the case that one cannot take a mere number so seriously. It simply tells you in some limited sense where you are relative to a population of people."

I have no idea why the tests gave such big differences in scores but I definately think its easier the second time you do the tests because I remembered the strategies for solving the problems which took some time to figure out when I first did the tests. I am kind of against keep re-doing the tests because of learning effects and a bit truobled [sic] that different test produce such different results."

Tofu [writes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d1e53e8c69c95c3a):

> "I've purposely not been doing anything to practice for the tests or anything else I thought could increase my score so I wouldn't have to factor other things into an improvement in iq, which makes improvements more likely attributable to dual n-back.  Before I took the test I scored at 117, a score about 1 in about 8 people can get (7.78 to be exact), and yesterday I scored at 127 (a score that 1 in 28 people would get).  Its a pretty big difference I would say."

After a year of N-backing, Tofu has [3 sets of IQ test results](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3af97e7c14585851) using _Self-Scoring IQ Tests_ ([Victor Serebriakoff](!Wikipedia)). To summarize:

1. 0 months (D3B; ~71%): 27,25 = 117 IQ
2. 3 (T4B; ~76%): 37,40[^division] = 128
3. 12 (Q6B; ~47%): 34,42 = 128

Other relevant tests for Tofu:

Also, in high school I took a professionally administered IQ test and got a 137 which may have been high because they took my age into account in the scoring like the old school IQ tests used to do, but I'm not sure if they actually did that."

(It's a little unclear whether this was an improvement or not; the second score was on the [Cattell Culture Fair III](!Wikipedia) test, but Lachlan hasn't said what the first one was. Since different tests have different norms and what not, Lachlan's scores could actually be the same or declining.)

Argumzio comments on Jan:

> "The difference between (what I assume both are) WAIS-III and RAPM is fairly significant; the former is about 2.667 sigma (FSIQ), and the latter is just over 3 sigma. For those who wish to know, both are set with a standard deviation of 15.
>
> Keep in mind, however, that with WAIS-III you get the full treatment while with RAPM your fluid ability is assessed as in the original Jaeggi study, so Jan's performance on other factors may have depressed and concealed his (already) high Gf, or performance, capabilities. That's why it is paramount to use the same test, or a test that is essentially of the same design."

##### No improvement

Some have not:

jttoto [reports](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/448c86efa0b645d1) a null result:

> "6 months ago I posted my IQ on this site after taking the Mensa Norway
test... [see IQ tests section]
>
> I scored a 135.  After 6 months of dual n-back, triple n-back, and quad n-back training, I took the same exact test.  I scored exactly the same, 135.
>
> Granted, I took 7 less minutes to complete the test, but this was due to familiarity of some of the questions. That being said, I have been seeing significant increases in my digit span and other WM gains, so while my aptitude on questions like the Raven's may not have increased, my memory has."

(It's worth noting that Jttoto's experience doesn't rule out an IQ increase of some sort, as the original 135 score was from an IQ test he took after at least 10 hours of n-backing over 5 days, according to an [earlier email](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/448c86efa0b645d1); what it shows is that Jttoto didn't benefit or the benefits happened early on, or there's some other confounding factor. Test results can be very difficult to interpret.)

moe [writes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7e859b3a7bfeb0d8):

> "After 6 months of training I decided to take the [tri 52](http://www.cerebrals.org/wp/?page_id=44) again and there has been no improvement in intelligence (or should I say abstract reasoning ability), I'm still at 144 sd15 on that test.  My digit span has gone up a bit from 9 forward 8 reverse to between 10-12 forward and reverse depending on how I'm feeling. I'm still not sure if the improvements in digit span are genuine memory improvements or increased skill at chunking."

Jttoto further wrote in response to moe:

> "Yes, I've continued to train QnB myself (about 3-4 times a week). Based on the iqout.com test, if anything, I've gone down a little!. This is not surprising and probably not attributed to n-backing.  I'm at the age where cognitive decline begins and I was depressed that day.  At the same time, one would think I would see measurable gains by now."

> "I've had pretty unimpressive findings. I've used Brain Workshop 4.4 for about four months, with about a half-hours use 4-6 days a week. I used Denmark IQ test and scored a 112 and after dnb I scored a 110.
>
> My max dnb level was 11. Hours and hours and no gain in iq."

[Mike](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/dd799cde5c43321):

> "...here they are (in order of test taking): 119, 125, 125, 107, 153, 131, (and I would say between 125 and 131 was my real iq) from different online tests almost 2 years ago before starting n-backing. after two years (I took the same bunch of online iq tests 3 weeks ago before trying faster trials) I got: 126, 135, 124, 125. so there wasn't much of a change. but I had been playing n-back softly for a long time. I expected my iq to jump at least by 5 to 10 points, from what I felt in my life. then after my week of faster trials, I did this iq test: and I got 149. if anyone who already knows his iq wants to try it, I'd be curious to know if they also score higher than expected, at first try of course. I thought the 153 I once got was pure chance, but maybe it wasn't completely, and that would be cool."

Keep in mind, that if IQ is improved, that doesn't necessarily mean anything unless one employs it to some end. It would be a shame to boost one's IQ through N-back, but never use it because one was too busy playing!

### Other effects

[Jack Nguyen asked](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/14c843162167c376) what benefits people saw from N-back use. The responses (and quotes from other threads) are, of course, entirely anecdotal, so take them as you will.

Besides these collected reports, there is an ongoing [group survey](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDdYbzhnOUFPTUd1ZERES1Q5TjJZd3c6MQ) ([spreadsheet results](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=t7Xo8g9AOMGudDDKT9N2Yww); n-backers are strongly encouraged to submit their datapoints & opinions there as well.

#### Benefits

- Ashirgo: "To be honest, I do not feel any obvious difference. There are moments in which I perceive a significant improvement, though, as well as particulars task which are much easier now."

    "I have also experienced better dream recalling, with all these reveries and other hallucinations included ;) I am more happier now than ever. I did doubt it would be ever possible! I am also more prone to get excited...Now people in my motherland are just boring to listen to. They speak too slow and seem as though it took them pains to express anything. I did not notice that after I had done my first ninety days of n-back, but now (after 2.5 months) it is just conspicuous."[ref](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)

     "My change of opinion^[from at 90 days seeing little effect, to 2.5 months later producing the second testament] can be easily attributed to the improvement of mood, in coincidence with the mere fact that the winter days have passed and now there is a bright and sunny Spring in my country:)"; when asked if the previous means Ashirgo attributes all the improvement to the weather, Ashirgo [replied](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8f3f840e05a90509): "Fortunately, I can attribute many changes to n-back, I can now handle various tasks with little effort and it takes me much less time in comparison with others (especially when I know what to do:) ). Nevertheless, the main problem for me is that I am also occupied with few things that I suppose to be able to test my newly acquired potential, therefore I cannot say that "changes" are explicit everywhere.

    On the other hand, I am starting to believe that any improvements (that one can expect) so smoothly and swiftly become a natural part of one's capabilities that it makes them hardly noticeable until some tests/measures are taken."
- chinmi04: "For me, it definitely has taught me how to focus. But I'm still not sure whether that has something to do with merely coming to realize the importance of focusing, or whether the program has really physically rewired my brain to focus better.

But again, the effects are not so clear as to completely eliminate any doubt regarding the connection with the n-back program."

I guess in a way I'm trying to say that for me, whilst the focus may have been on G increase and IQ etc, now the focus is on--what's *really* happened and what can I do with it :). What I can do with it is choose to concentrate long enough to genuinely understand fairly technical in depth chapters on subjects often new to me."[ref](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c) Karnautrahl writes more on his self-improvements in his thread ["Second lot of training started-and long term experience overall."](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/9c233ef7c68b16dc), and [describes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/aa849686781add83) an incident in which though he stopped using DNB 3 months previously, he still dealt with a technical issue much faster and more effectively than he feels he would've before.
- negatron: "One perhaps coincidental thing I noticed is that dream recollection went up substantially. A good while after I stopped I developed an odd curiosity for what I previously considered unpleasant material, such as advanced mathematics. Never imagined I'd consider the thought of advanced calculus exciting. I began reading up on such subjects far more frequently than I used to. This was well after I've long forgotten about dual n-back so I find it hard to attribute it to a placebo effect, believing that I'm more adapted to this material. On the other hand I don't recall reading anything about motivational benefits to dual n-back training so I still consider this conjecture and perhaps an eventful coincidence just the same."[ref](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c)

- astriaos: "By 'robust', I mean practically everything I do is qualitatively different from how I did things 30 days previous to the dual n-back training. For instance, in physics class I went from vaguely understanding most of the concepts covered in class to a mastery thorough enough that now my questions usually transcend the scope of the in-class and textbook material, routinely stupefying my physics teacher into longer-than-average pauses. It's the same experience for all of my classes. Somehow, I've learned more-than-I usually learn of physics/government/ etc. (all of my classes, and any topic in general) information from sources outside of class, and without what I consider significant effort. I feel like my learning speed has gone up by some factor greater than 1; I can follow longer arguments with greater precision; my vocabulary has improved; I can pay attention longer; my problem solving skills are significantly better... Really, it's amazing how much cognition depends on attention!"[ref](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)

The practice is very difficult and requires loads of concentration but I am experiencing perceivable gains in clarity of thought from one day of practice to the next whereas my gains from brainworkshop alone were not perceivable on a daily basis." UOChris1 [wrote](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/183b75e34b11b3e1) of another mode: "Triple-N-Back at .5sec intervals and piano notes instead of letters has greatly improved my subjectively perceived fluidity of thought.  I am much more engaged in class, can read much quicker, and am coming up with many more creative solutions now than ever before.  I didn't notice the improvements as much when I was using slower intervals--I feel I make more decision cycles in a given amount of time before coming to a solution.
- [Pontus Granström](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/7ec15b99a2a1a2f0) "I certainly feel calmer happier and more motivated after doing DNB, it has to do with the increase of dopamine receptors no doubt!"
- [Chris Warren](#hardcore) summarizes the results of his intensive practice (covered above): "For those that are curious, I noticed the largest change in my thought processes on Wednesday. My abilities were noticeably different, to the extent that, at some points, it was, well, startling. I've started getting used to the feeling, so I can't really compare my intelligence now vs. Wednesday. However, I'm completely confident that I've become smarter. Under the kind of stress I've put my brain through, I can't imagine a scenario where that _wouldn't_ happen."

    "After the first couple days of training, I experienced a very rapid increase in intelligence. It suddenly became easier to think. I can't give you any hard evidence, since I didn't bother to take any tests before I started. However, I can give you this: when I woke up Wednesday morning, I felt the same as I did after the first time I tried n-back. Except the feeling was 10 times stronger, and my thinking was noticeably faster and more comprehensive."
- [Raman](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/7ec15b99a2a1a2f0) reports an initial null result: "19 days with n-back are over... no subjective benefits as such. But I am aware at what point I am comfortable or not. e.g. y'day playing the game was effortless, and today my brain felt sort of sticky, the sequence was just not sticking in my brain. very strange what a few hours can do."
- [iwan tulijef](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/9f3b791ee0fb1c38) says that "Long time ago I was diagnosed Adhd [sic] and for long time I took meds and this training helped me to reduce my meds nearly to zero, compared with the doses I took before. Unfortunately this haven't fixed the whole thing. But what I noticed was, hmm... those things are very difficult to describe.... that time by time I got more control about my mental life. Obvious effects in social matters were e.g. that I could follow conversations better and behave more naturally. In my education matters, e.g. that I understood maths proofs better. There are a lot of details. Interesting was, as these issues are, to understate it a bit, not unimportant for me, that in the beginning when I remarked changes, I got a bit euphoric, so the first effects of n-back feeled like the strongest." and warns us that "It's very difficult and very questionable to take objective informations out of subjective self evaluation." (Iwan trained for 3-4 months, 20 rounds a day in the morning & evening.)
- [jttoto](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/448c86efa0b645d1) saw no gain on an IQ test, but thinks he's benefited anyway: "My friends have always called me inattentive and absent-minded, but since playing n-back no one has called me that for a while. I now never forget where I park my car, when I used to do that nearly every other day. I feel more attentive. Even if my ability to solve problems hasn't improved, the gains in my memory are real and measurable."
- [reece](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4a0b81bb5f72647f): "Not that I've noticed [an improvement in [lateral thinking](!Wikipedia)]. I have noticed an improvement in my working memory however -- seems easier to juggle a few ideas in my head at the same time which presumably the quad-n-back has helped with."
    "I recently noticed that it appears to have made me better at playing ping pong and tetris. Oddly enough however, it doesn't appear to have improved my reaction time...Working memory has improved, however other things I've always struggled with such as uncued long term memory recall have not... I'm still very absent-minded and believe n-back has made me more easily distractable (lowered latent inhibition?), although to be fair, I may have brought this on myself by playing quad n-back and this was not something I noticed when only playing dual n-back. I seem to be able to get by on about one hour less sleep per night and perform better cognitively when sleep deprived. Dream recall has increased significantly as has lucid dreaming. I do take a few nootropics, however I've been taking the same ones for years...Verbal fluency appears to have improved, proper spelling and punctuation are things I've always struggled with and do not appear to have ameliorated resultant from n-back training." ([Poll](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3008683d4b314f6/5e833c4c0df9fb9b))
    "In my experience with dual and multimodal n-back, the benefits I've most observed have been increased multitasking ability and increased concentration in the presence of distractions. For me, the benefits of n-back training are most apparent on days I don't take my ADHD medication. I have been training DNB with position-sound and color-image modes lately. I used QNB for several months in the past, however I (subjectively) believe DNB is giving me the most benefit."

- [exigentsky](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3008683d4b314f6/5e833c4c0df9fb9b): "I've seen improvements in executive function and motivation. After DNB, I am more inclined to study and complete long pending items. However, there is a confounding variable. I don't usually do DNB when in an unhealthy state of mind (for example, with little sleep and extremely high stress). Still, I believe that I can attribute some of the effects only to DNB.

    In terms of working memory and other cognitive measures, I'm not sure. I don't notice anything dramatic but also haven't stuck to a DNB regime for more than a few weeks."
- [cev](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3008683d4b314f6/5e833c4c0df9fb9b): "I think I've put my finger on a particular benefit of dnb training: it seems to help my brain's 'internal clock' - I am better able to order my thoughts in time.

    DNB has also helped my foosball (!) playing: at a high level the game involves complex strings of motor movements and since I've been training, I've found that my coordination of these movements has greatly improved despite no longer practising."

- [erm](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1sm/akrasia_tactics_review/1nl4): "I can rely on this to drastically reduce anxiety, flightiness, improve concentration. It also seems to whet my appetite for intellectual work and increase purposefulness across the board."
- [Tofu](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3af97e7c14585851), after a year of n-backing:
     "N-back training may have somehow improved my verbal intelligence, but since verbal intelligence is a form of crystallized intelligence and training working memory is supposed to primarily improve fluid intelligence, it probably didn't. My score on the verbal subtest went up and then down which would make no sense if it did have any influence...Since my IQ score increased from the first test to the second test, and stayed the same from the second test to the third test it could be possibly that working memory only contributes to IQ up to a certain point.  All in all, I feel more inclined to say that n-back training has only a little if any effect on IQ though which is why reason I'm probably going to stop doing the n-back training.

     On a more positive note, since I started n-back training I have noticed better concentration which I had a serious problem with before.  In general, I feel like I think more clearly and I at least feel like I've become smarter too. I've reached a pretty high level in n-back and any gains I've made in the last month or two have been small, so I think I've reached a long-term plateau which is another reason for me to stop the training.  From my experience when I stop the n-back training for a month or two and return to n-back training I still perform at the same level anyway.  It seems like the effects from training are going to last a while which is also good news. Overall, I feel like the n-back training was worth it but if I had it to do over I would have probably stopped after a couple of months."
- [kriegerlie](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/e5ed78ad41d397cb): "i've defnitely had some benefit, like pontus said, dunno about being smarter, but my focus is incredible now. I can do what i thought I could never do, purely because I can focus more. Placebo or not. It's a definite effect."
- [Rotem](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/e5ed78ad41d397cb): "DNB works, It's one of the best investments I made in my life.

- [chortly](http://www.metafilter.com/91797/working-working-memory-with-dual-nback#3081757): "For a while I imagined that my working memory muscles were indeed strengthening, the main sensation being that I could retain the various threads of a complicated conversation better as they dangled and were forgotten by the other conversationalists. But that was probably just wishful thinking. Because it's boring and difficult, I haven't stuck with it, though I keep intending to."
- [JHarris](http://www.metafilter.com/91797/working-working-memory-with-dual-nback#3108845): "I've been working with the dual n-back program for a bit of time now. Improvement is slow, but seems to be happening; I just had a 68% run at dual 3-back. Observations like this are not really scientific and hellishly subject to bias, but I think I may be noticing it slightly easier to think effectively."
- [Neurohacker](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/efec0cfe9f67e91f) (in a thread on [ADHD](!Wikipedia)): "I'm definitely finding it helpful, even if it's just giving me some practice at focusing...as a complementary strategy [to medication], it's certainly working wonders."
- [iwan tulijef](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/efec0cfe9f67e91f): "n-Back helped me a lot. Especially in the beginning when I started with DNB, the effect was astounding. I got much faster in understanding written and spoken words.In the beginning I think the function of my working memory was really bad. What then happened is that I got habituated to the effect and the increases were smaller, so
noticing improvements got more difficult."
- [Arkanj3l](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/2f2ea6c33bc04e53): "On a side, I really enjoy the lucid feeling I get after an hour of n-back.

- [Michael Logan](http://www.logan-counseling.com/rockford-counseling-discoveries-brain-training-to-improve-memory-boosts-fluid-intelligence-2/): "...and learned very, very quickly that I had a short term memory and attention issue. The dual n back task laughed at me, but I vowed to overcome my inattention and short term memory issues, and within a few practices, I noticed an improvement not only in my scores on the computerized game, but in session with my clients....So [Mind Sparke](http://www.mindsparke.com/) does provide that kind of novel learning challenge.   I have not taken an IQ test, but I do believe the use of the tool is helping me build cognitive reserve for the later stages of my life."
- [milestones](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/75639eb9ec430d09/f43418c779ad241d): "I'm grateful for the gains I seemed to have received from training dual n back. I used to be extremely forgetful with remembering where I put things and now it's very easy to retrace steps and recall where I placed xyz item. As far as IQ tests go, I did see a gain on a well designed (untimed) culture fair test of about 1 standard deviation after training one DNB on and off for close 2 years. (Other tests with lower ceilings, however, showed no or marginal gains)." A [later post](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/f0c0a9cd8cd0ba0a/8d224603737f4bae): "The gains I'm seeing are: faster encoding speed; faster and more accurate retrieval of data from long term memory; as well as an increase in data-sequencing speed (the latter is a relative weakness of mine that now seems to have been helped by consistent quad-back training -- though I've not tested any transfer so this is subjective). Also, though my fluid intelligence has probably ceased gaining, it seems I'm functioning at higher bands of ability far more regularly -- even when I'm tired or sluggish."
- [Lachlan Jones](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/da01159674cc5af0) wrote, after a before/after IQ report, "The most significant real word application for me has been improvements in my piano playing.

I can also attest to a pretty large working memory improvement, beyond what I would call placebo (the effects of which I am very well aware). Even if it is not very effective, I still say this game is fun."

I think it's being in a prolonged alpha-brain wave dominant state, tbh, because I found that when I was younger and took up heavy reading projects I felt the same improvements--that is, having more focus, being able to 'hear' myself think very distinctly to the point where I could compose poems/emails in my head without effort. I don't know why this is, but it happens so much with me that I can't doubt that there is a real effect on my personality and default mental state when I'm doing 'intellectual' things."

#### No benefits

- Confuzedd: "[asked if felt 'sharper']: Nothing."
- Chris: "One thing I have noticed is the recollection of a number of very unpleasant images in dreams. Specifically, images of bodily disease, mutilation, injury and post-mortem decomposition. I find it difficult to believe it's just a coincidence, because I can't remember when I last had such a dream, and I've had maybe half a dozen since I started dual n-back. But perhaps it's simply owing to better recall."[ref](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c)
- [Pheonexia](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8f3f840e05a90509): "now I'm at 6-back and am consistently between 50 and 80% accurate....All that said, I have NOT noticed any differences in my mental capacity, intelligence, daily life, or even ability to remember things that just happened. I still sometimes forget people's names right after they tell me them. I'm going to keep training though, because just because I haven't consciously noticed these things, I have faith in scientific studies, so with enough training hopefully I'll yield some positive benefits."
- [TheQ17](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d1eb1dbfb5cce800) reports little to no benefit: "At any rate, I don't feel studying is any easier although it wasn't really difficult to begin with for me. Perhaps I'll give it another go over break and report back. My goal originally was to get to P5B before adding a second sound stimulus making a Sextuple Nback but I don't know if Shamanu made an updated version to make that any easier. I'm also kind of on the fence about the effect on the depth of training. It may have been more beneficial to do higher N levels instead of more stimuli."
- [Jonathan Graehl](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/2fkb): "I can do dual 4-back with 95%+ accuracy and 5-back with 60%, and I've likely plateaued (naturally, my skill rapidly improved at first). I enjoy it as "practice focusing on something", but haven't noticed any evidence of any general improvement in memory or other mental abilities."
- [Will Newsome](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/2fkc): "After doing 100 trials of dual N back stretched over a week (mostly 4 back) I noticed that I felt slightly more conscious: my emotions were more salient, I enjoyed simple things more, and I just felt generally more alive. There were tons of free variables for me, though, so I doubt causation."
- [steven0461](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/2i7b): "I did maybe 10-15 half-hour sessions of mostly D5B-D6B last year over the course of a few weeks and didn't notice any effects."
- [EggplantWizard](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/81vkd/worried_about_your_working_memory_capacity/c080v66) (D3B->D10B): "I would say that there has been some form of improvement -- though it's not clear if the improvement is task-specific. I haven't noticed any significant difference in my day to day life, but (to be immodest in the name of efficiency for a moment) I had a very good memory to begin with, and I would say strong fluid intelligence. It's possible that people starting from positions of lower fluid intelligence would see a more pronounced benefit."

#### Creativity

One of the worries occasionally cited is that DNB training mostly serves to increase one's focus on the task one is thinking about. Which is great in most contexts but, the fear goes, the ability to focus on one thing is the ability to exclude ('inhibit') thoughts on all other topics - which is crucial to creativity. Working memory and ability to shift attention has a strong correlation with being able to solve [insight problem](!Wikipedia)s with lateral thinking, but as with the WM-IQ link, that doesn't say what happens when one intervenes on one side of the correlation (correlation is not causation):

> "Individuals may have difficulty in keeping in mind alternatives because multiple possibilities can exceed their working memory capacity (Byrne, 2005; Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991; 2002). They also need to be able to switch their attention between the alternative possibilities to reach a solution. On this account, key component skills required in insight problem solving include attention switching and working memory skills....Attention and working memory may be crucial for different aspects of successful insight problem solving. Planning a number of moves in advance may be important to solve insight problems such as the well-known nine-dot problem (Chronicle, Ormerod and MacGregor, 2001). Attention may play a role in helping people to decide what elements of a problem to focus on or in helping them to direct the search for relevant information internally and externally.
>
> ...Individuals who are good at solving insight problems are also good at switching attention. Correct performance on the insight problems was associated with correct performance on the visual elevator task (r=.515, p<.01). Correct performance on the insight problems was associated with correct performance on the plus-minus problems (r=-.511, n=32, p<.001)...Consistent with this account individuals who are better at storing and processing information in working memory are better at solving insight problems. [correlation with problem score: r=.39 for digit span, r=.511 for sentence span]"^[["Attention and Working Memory in Insight Problem-Solving"](http://www.psych.unito.it/csc/cogsci05/frame/poster/2/f285-murray.pdf), Murray 2011. The study does not seem to have controlled for IQ, so it's hard to say whether the WM/attention are responsible for increased performance or not.]

[Dopamine](!Wikipedia) is related to changes caused by n-backing (see the [McNab](#whats-some-relevant-research) receptor study), and increase in dopamine has been shown to cause a narrowing of focus/associations in [priming](!Wikipedia "Priming (psychology") tasks[^ldopa]. There are other related correlations on this; for example, Cassimjee 2010^[["Temperament and character correlates of neuropsychological performance"](http://www.up.ac.za/dspace/handle/2263/14719), June 2010, _Psychological Society of South Africa_] report that "...the temperament dimension of [Novelty Seeking](!Wikipedia) was inversely related to performance accuracy on the LNB2 (Letter-N-Back)." But as ever, [correlation is not causation](!Wikipedia); this result might not mean anything about someone deliberately increasing performance accuracy by practice - we might take it to mean just that narrow uninterested people had a small advantage at n-backing when they first began. Cassimjee 2010 cites 2 other studies suggesting what this correlation means: "...participants with higher impulsivity may lack the attentional resources to retain critical information and inhibit irrelevant information. The activation of reactive control, which is a system that monitors, modulates and regulates reactive aspects of temperament, is inhibited in individuals high in novelty seeking..." This suggests the performance difference is a weakness that can be strengthened, not to a fundamental trade-off.

[^ldopa]: From Sanderberg/Bostrom 2006:

     > "Giving [L-dopa](!Wikipedia), a dopamine precursor, to healthy volunteers did not affect direct semantic priming (faster recognition of words directly semantically related to a previous word, such as “black-white”) but did inhibit indirect priming (faster recognition of more semantically distant words, such as “summer-snow”) (Kischka et al. 1996). This was interpreted by the authors of the study as dopamine inhibiting the spread of activation within the semantic network, that is, a focusing on the task."

Reports from n-backers are mixed. One negative report is from [john21012101](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/f1eefb13c1658b24/e2490a2f19cb4abb):

> "I've done the dual n-back task avidly for over a month and while I find it makes me mentally sharper, that comes a high cost - the loss of creativity and lateral thinking.  In fact, I experience what is called as severe directed attention fatigue (see <www.troutfoot.com/attn/dafintro.html>).
>
> ...and even short booster sessions severely impair creativity to the point that one becomes very mentally flat, single-minded, and I'd even say zombie-ish."

Ashirgo, chinmi04, & putomayo begged to differ in the same thread, with biped plumping for a null result.

There are some theoretical reasons to believe DNB isn't causing gains at the expense of creativity, as there is that Jaeggi study showing _Gf_ gains, and _Gf_ is mildly correlated with creativity, according to [exigentsky](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/f1eefb13c1658b24/8c267394bb1081cc):

> "Furthermore, if the preliminary results hold and dual-n-back actually increased Gf, it should actually contribute to creativity for most people. After all, studies have shown that creativity (according to standard tests) and IQ are significantly correlated to a certain point (~120 on most). While both tests are imperfect and incomplete, they do give a general picture.
>
> I have not felt a decrease in my creativity and am skeptical of the idea that dual-n-back harms it. If the purported mechanism is increasing [latent inhibition](!Wikipedia), that would be an even bigger breakthrough than increasing IQ. The former is still largely considered immutable."

[Vlad](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1b0b307f9605ba4e/47d0a2fcc41ae4d3) has some more details on those correlations:

> "Last but not least, there was this research "Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students", which I studied because of this today, and they found *positive* correlation IQ vs verbal and figural creative processes (fluency, flexibility, object designing, specific traits, insight...). And this mild correlation (of 0.3 - 0.5), did not differ for different IQ levels (higher IQs had mild higher creativity, lower IQs had mild lower creativity - always mild relationship, so exceptions too, but in general more IQ meant more creativity)."

On the other hand, Vlad [also points out](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1b0b307f9605ba4e?hl=en) that:

> "...there are few theories how WM works, and one of the most explaining is, that WM and attention are tied closely together (Ash always emphasizes this and he is right :). This should work through the fact, that higher WM means more sources for inhibition of distraction. So, the more WM, the better you can concentrate. They tested this with cocktail party effect: in general, only 33% of persons catch their name from irrelevant background noise, while concentrating on some task. Now they found, that only 20% of high WM people caught their name, but 65% of low WM. On the other side, contemporary researches sometimes differ between WM, STM, primary / secondary WM, even LTM... But the point is, attention works at least partly as a filter, and it gets better with higher WM.
>
> Now the issue with creativity. I find this interesting, because I think somebody here worried already about being subjectively less creative than before BW training, and I got this feeling few times too.
>
> ...Every creator must deeply concentrate on his work. Maybe there are different kinds of creativity: "ADHD" creativity, meaningful creativity, brainstorming creativity, appreciation of art, and so on.
>
> Btw after training dnb, I got this interest in art - I downloaded lots of classical and other artistic pictures (never before), and really enjoyed choosing which I like. Or have you ever seen "the hours"? I fell in love with that movie :) and even started to read  things from virginia woolf"

As well, Pheonexia points out that [McNab 2008](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/McNab2008.pdf) & McNab 2009 demonstrated increases in various things related to [dopamine](!Wikipedia) because of DNB, and that there is one study that ["Dopamine agonists disrupt visual latent inhibition in normal males using a within-subject paradigm"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12610717).

# What's some relevant research?

The main Jaeggi studies (2003, and 2008) are available in the Group's [Files](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/files) folder, as is the McNab 2009 study showing physical changes to dopamine neurochemistry after N-back training. Working memory training including variants on dual n-back has been shown to physically change/increase the distribution of white matter in the brain^[["Training of Working Memory Impacts Structural Connectivity"](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/9/3297), Takeuchi 2010 in _[Journal of Neuroscience](!Wikipedia)_; available in the Group Files.] All of the studies in that folder was well worth reading for background information.

- ["Training and transfer effects of executive functions in preschool
children"](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/Thorell2008.pdf):

> "Executive functions, including working memory and inhibition, are of central importance to much of human behavior. Interventions intended to improve executive functions might therefore serve an important purpose. Previous studies show that working memory can be improved by training, but it is unknown if this also holds for inhibition, and whether it is possible to train executive functions in preschoolers. In the present study, preschool children received computerized training of either visuo-spatial working memory or inhibition for 5 weeks. An active control group played commercially available computer games, and a passive control group took part in only pre- and posttesting. Children trained on working memory improved significantly on trained tasks; they showed training effects on non-trained tests of spatial and verbal working memory, as well as transfer effects to attention. Children trained on inhibition showed a significant improvement over time on two out of three trained task paradigms, but no significant improvements relative to the control groups on tasks measuring working memory or attention. In neither of the two interventions were there effects on non-trained inhibitory tasks. The results suggest that working memory training can have significant effects also among preschool children. The finding that inhibition could not be improved by either one of the two training programs might be due to the particular training program used in the present study or possibly indicate that executive functions differ in how easily they can be improved by training, which in turn might relate to differences in their underlying psychological and neural processes."

> "A neural network underlying attentional control involves the anterior cingulate in addition to lateral prefrontal areas. An important development of this network occurs between 3 and 7 years of age. We have examined the efficiency of attentional networks across age and after 5 days of attention training (experimental group) compared with different types of no training (control groups) in 4-year-old and 6-year-old children. Strong improvement in executive attention and intelligence was found from ages 4 to 6 years. Both 4- and 6-year-olds showed more mature performance after the training than did the control groups. This finding applies to behavioral scores of the executive attention network as measured by the attention network test, event-related potentials recorded from the scalp during attention network test performance, and intelligence test scores. We also documented the role of the temperamental factor of effortful control and the DAT1 gene in individual differences in attention. Overall, our data suggest that the executive attention network appears to develop under strong genetic control, but that it is subject to educational interventions during development."

- ["Common and unique components of inhibition and working memory: An fMRI, within-subjects investigation"](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/McNab2008.pdf)

> "Behavioural findings indicate that the core executive functions of inhibition and working memory are closely linked, and neuroimaging studies indicate overlap between their neural correlates. There has not, however, been a comprehensive study, including several inhibition tasks and several working memory tasks, performed by the same subjects. In the present study, 11 healthy adult subjects completed separate blocks of 3 inhibition tasks (a stop task, a go/no-go task and a flanker task), and 2 working memory tasks (one spatial and one verbal). Activation common to all 5 tasks was identified in the right inferior frontal gyrus, and, at a lower threshold, also the right middle frontal gyrus and right parietal regions (BA 40 and BA 7). Left inferior frontal regions of interest (ROIs) showed a significant conjunction between all tasks except the flanker task. The present study could not pinpoint the specific function of each common region, but the parietal region identified here has previously been consistently related to working memory storage and the right inferior frontal gyrus has been associated with inhibition in both lesion and imaging studies. These results support the notion that inhibitory and working memory tasks involve common neural components, which may provide a neural basis for the interrelationship between the two systems."

> "Recent functional neuroimaging evidence suggests a bottleneck between learning new information and remembering old information. In two behavioral experiments and one functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, we tested the hypothesis that learning and remembering compete when both processes happen within a brief period of time. In the first behavioral experiment, participants intentionally remembered old words displayed in the foreground, while incidentally learning new scenes displayed in the background. In line with a memory competition, we found that remembering old information was associated with impaired learning of new information. We replicated this finding in a subsequent fMRI experiment, which showed that this behavioral effect was coupled with a suppression of learning-related activity in visual and medial temporal areas. Moreover, the fMRI experiment provided evidence that left mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in resolving the memory competition, possibly by facilitating rapid switching between learning and remembering. Critically, a follow-up behavioral experiment in which the background scenes were replaced with a visual target detection task provided indications that the competition between learning and remembering was not merely due to attention. This study not only provides novel insight into our capacity to learn and remember, but also clarifies the neural mechanisms underlying flexible behavior."

> "Functional brain-imaging data document overlapping sites of activation in prefrontal cortex across memory tasks, suggesting that these tasks may share common executive components. We leveraged this evidence to develop a training regimen and a set of transfer tasks to examine the trainability of a putative executive-control process: interference resolution. Eight days of training on high-interference versions of three different working memory tasks increased the efficiency with which proactive interference was resolved on those particular tasks. Moreover, an improved ability to resolve interference was also transferred to different working memory, semantic memory, and episodic memory tasks, a demonstration of far-transfer effects from process-specific training. Participants trained with noninterference versions of the tasks did not exhibit transfer. We infer that the transfer we demonstrated resulted from increased efficiency of the interference-resolution process. Therefore, this aspect of executive control is plastic and adaptive, and can be improved by training."

Engle, 2007), the authors tested the relations among WMC, mind wandering, and goal neglect in a sustained attention to response task (SART; a go/no-go task). In 3 SART versions, making conceptual versus perceptual processing demands, subjects periodically indicated their thought content when probed following rare no-go targets. SART processing demands did not affect mind-wandering rates, but mind-wandering rates varied with WMC and predicted goal-neglect errors in the task; furthermore, mind-wandering rates partially mediated the WMC-SART relation, indicating that WMC-related differences in goal neglect were due, in part, to variation in the control of conscious thought."

     > "Several recent latent variable analyses suggest that (working memory capacity) accounts for at least one-third and perhaps as much as one-half of the variance in (intelligence).What seems to be important about WM span tasks is that they require the active maintenance of information in the face of concurrent processing and interference and therefore recruit an executive attention-control mechanism to combat interference. Furthermore, this ability seems to be mediated by portions of the prefrontal cortex."

### Jaeggi 2008

["Improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory"](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/04/25/0801268105.abstract) ([local PDF](docs/jaeggi2008.pdf)), Jaeggi et al 2008; this article was widely covered (eg. [Science Daily](!Wikipedia)'s ["Brain-Training To Improve Memory Boosts Fluid Intelligence"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080505075642.htm) or [_Wired_](!Wikipedia "Wired (magazine)")'s ["Forget _Brain Age_: Researchers Develop Software That Makes You Smarter"](http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/04/smart_software)) and sparked most people's interest in the topic. The abstract:

> "Fluid intelligence (_Gf_) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. _Gf_  is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, _Gf_ is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of _Gf_ can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased _Gf_ in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of _Gf_. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in _Gf_. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications."

Brain Workshop includes a special 'Jaeggi mode' which replicates almost exactly the settings described for the "Brain Twister" software used in the study.

No study is definitive, of course, but Jaeggi 2008 is still one of the major studies that must be cited in any DNB discussion. There are some issues - not as many subjects as one would like, and the researchers (quoted in the _Wired_ article) obviously don't know if the WM or _Gf_ gains are durable; more technical issues like the administered _Gf_ IQ tests being speeded and thus reduced in validity have been raised by [Moody](#moody-2009-re-jaeggi-2008).

> "General fluid intelligence (_Gf_) is a human ability to reason and solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge and experience. It is considered one of the most important factors in learning. One of the issues which academic people concentrates on is whether _Gf_ of adults can be improved. According to the Dual N-back working memory theory and the characteristics of visual perceptual learning, this paper put forward cognitive training pattern based on Gabor stimuli. A total of 20 undergraduate students at 24 years old participated in the experiment, with ten training sessions for ten days. Through using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices as the evaluation method to get and analyze the experimental results, it was proved that training pattern can improve fluid intelligence of adults. This will promote a wide range of applications in the field of adult intellectual education."

Discussion and criticism of this paper took place in [2](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/7321c36dca3dcfad/3eb3ac6bd64498f0) [threads](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/80613920c0fbd422/3e7310cc84628fea); the SPM was administer in 25 minutes, which while not as fast as Jaeggi 2008, is still not the normal length

### polar (June 2009)

A group member, polar, conducted a small experiment at his university where he was a student; [his results](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4b0697d5619d873b/7b91f868a3f7f979) seemed to show an [improvement](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=rOfijmsJ-hxPbzmbi4dmHVg). As polar would be the first to admit, the attrition in subjects (few to begin with), relatively short time of training and whatnot make the power of his study weak.

### Jaeggi 2010

["The relationship between n-back performance and matrix reasoning — implications for training and transfer"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6W4M-514Y84N-1/2/0c0b63b75c903bd5b30346422e34c442), Jaeggi et al, in [_Intelligence_](!Wikipedia "Intelligence (journal)") ([local PDF](docs/jaeggi2010.pdf)); abstract:

> "...In the first study, we demonstrated that dual and single n-back task performances are approximately equally correlated with performance on two different tasks measuring _Gf_, whereas the correlation with a task assessing working memory capacity was smaller. Based on these results, the second study was aimed on testing the hypothesis that training on a single n-back task yields the same improvement in _Gf_ as training on a dual n-back task, but that there should be less transfer to working memory capacity. We trained two groups of students for four weeks with either a single or a dual n-back intervention. We investigated transfer effects on working memory capacity and _Gf_ comparing the two training groups' performance to controls who received no training of any kind. Our results showed that both training groups improved more on Gf than controls, thereby replicating and extending our prior results."

The 2 studies measured _Gf_ using Raven's APM and the BOMAT. In both studies, the tests were administered speeded to 10 or 15 minutes as in Jaeggi 2008. The experimental groups saw average gains of 1 or 2 additional correct answers on the BOMAT and APM.


## Criticism

### Moody 2009 (re: Jaeggi 2008)

[Jaeggi 2008](#jaeggi-2008), you may remember, showed that training on N-back improved working memory, but it also boosted scores on tests of _Gf_. The latter would be a major result - indeed, unique - and is one of the main research results encouraging people to do N-back in a non-research setting. People _want_ to believe that N-back is efficacious and particularly that it will do more than boost working memory. So we need to be wary of [confirmation bias](!Wikipedia) (for those of you who read too much fantasy, you'll know this as [Wizard's First Rule](!Wikipedia)).

Fortunately, we can [discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5c7247e00fe9bca9) at length the work of one David E. Moody who has [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2009.04.005) a criticism of how the odd methodology of Jaeggi 2008 undermines this result. He's worth quoting at length, since besides being important to understanding Jaeggi's study, it's an interesting example of how subtle issues can be important in psychology:

> "The subjects were divided into four groups, differing in the number of days of training they received on the task of working memory. The group that received the least training (8 days) was tested on Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1990), a widely used and well-established test of fluid intelligence. This group, however, demonstrated negligible improvement between pre- and post-test performance.
>
> The other three groups were not tested using Raven's Matrices, but rather on an alternative test of much more recent origin. The Bochumer Matrices Test (BOMAT) (Hossiep, Turck, & Hasella, 1999) is similar to Raven's in that it consists of visual analogies. In both tests, a series of geometric and other figures is presented in a matrix format and the subject is required to infer a pattern in order to predict the next figure in the series. The authors provide no reason for switching from Raven's to the BOMAT.
>
> The BOMAT differs from Raven's in some important respects, but is similar in one crucial attribute: both tests are progressive in nature, which means that test items are sequentially arranged in order of increasing difficulty. A high score on the test, therefore, is predicated on subjects' ability to solve the more difficult items.
>
> However, this progressive feature of the test was effectively eliminated by the manner in which Jaeggi et al. administered it. The BOMAT is a 29-item test which subjects are supposed to be allowed 45 min to complete. Remarkably, however, Jaeggi et al. reduced the allotted time from 45 min to 10. The effect of this restriction was to make it impossible for subjects to proceed to the more difficult items on the test. The large majority of the subjects—regardless of the number of days of training they received—answered less than 14 test items correctly.\
> By virtue of the manner in which they administered the BOMAT, Jaeggi et al. transformed it from a test of fluid intelligence into a speed test of ability to solve the easier visual analogies.
> The time restriction not only made it impossible for subjects to proceed to the more difficult items, it also limited the opportunity to learn about the test—and so improve performance—in the process of taking it. This factor cannot be neglected because test performance does improve with practice, as demonstrated by the control groups in the Jaeggi study, whose improvement from pre- to post-test was about half that of the experimental groups. The same learning process that occurs from one administration of the test to the next may also operate within a given administration of the test—provided subjects are allowed sufficient time to complete it.
>
> Since the whole weight of their conclusion rests upon the validity of their measure of fluid intelligence, one might assume the authors would present a careful defense of the manner in which they administered the BOMAT. Instead they do not even mention that subjects are normally allowed 45 min to complete the test. Nor do they mention that the test has 29 items, of which most of their subjects completed less than half.
>
> The authors' entire rationale for reducing the allotted time to 10 min is confined to a footnote. That footnote reads as follows:
>
> > Although this procedure differs from the standardized procedure, there is evidence that this timed procedure has little influence on relative standing in these tests, in that the correlation of speeded and non-speeded versions is very high (r = 0.95; ref. 37).
>
> The reference given in the footnote is to a 1988 study (Frearson & Eysenck, 1986) that is not in fact designed to support the conclusion stated by Jaeggi et al. The 1988 study merely contains a footnote of its own, which refers in turn to unpublished research conducted forty years earlier. That research involved Raven's matrices, not the BOMAT, and entailed a reduction in time of at most 50%, not more than 75%, as in the Jaeggi study.
>
> So instead of offering a reasoned defense of their procedure, Jaeggi et al. provide merely a footnote which refers in turn to a footnote in another study. The second footnote describes unpublished results, evidently recalled by memory over a span of 40 years, involving a different test and a much less severe reduction in time.
>
> In this context it bears repeating that the group that was tested on Raven's matrices (with presumably the same time restriction) showed virtually no improvement in test performance, in spite of eight days' training on working memory. Performance gains only appeared for the groups administered the BOMAT. But the BOMAT differs in one important respect from Raven's. Raven's matrices are presented in a 3 × 3 format, whereas the BOMAT consists of a 5 × 3 matrix configuration.
>
> With 15 visual figures to keep track of in each test item instead of 9, the BOMAT puts added emphasis on subjects' ability to hold details of the figures in working memory, especially under the condition of a severe time constraint. Therefore it is not surprising that extensive training on a task of working memory would facilitate performance on the early and easiest BOMAT test items—those that present less of a challenge to fluid intelligence.
>
> This interpretation acquires added plausibility from the nature of one of the two working-memory tasks administered to the experimental groups. The authors maintain that those tasks were “entirely different” from the test of fluid intelligence. One of the tasks merits that description: it was a sequence of letters presented auditorily through headphones.
>
> But the other working-memory task involved recall of the location of a small square in one of several positions in a visual matrix pattern. It represents in simplified form precisely the kind of detail required to solve visual analogies. Rather than being “entirely different” from the test items on the BOMAT, this task seems well-designed to facilitate performance on that test."

### Chein 2010

["Expanding the mind's workspace: Training and transfer effects with a
complex working memory span task"](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7721/is_201004/ai_n53507996/) ([local copy](docs/chein2010.pdf)); from the introduction:

> "In the present study, a novel working memory (WM) training paradigm was used to test the malleability of WM capacity and to determine the extent to which the benefits of this training could be transferred to other cognitive skills. Training involved verbal and spatial versions of a complex WM span task designed to emphasize simultaneous storage and processing requirements. Participants who completed 4 weeks of WM training
demonstrated significant improvements on measures of temporary memory. These WM training benefits generalized to performance on the Stroop task and, in a novel finding, promoted significant increases in reading
comprehension. The results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that WM training affects domain-general attention control mechanisms and can thereby elicit far-reaching cognitive benefits. Implications include the use of WM training as a general tool for enhancing important cognitive skills."

While WM training yielded many valuable benefits such as increased reading comprehension, it did not improve IQ as measured by an unspeeded Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) IQ test;

> "However, such power limitations do not readily account for our failure to replicate a transfer of WM training benefits to measures of fluid intelligence (as was observed by Jaeggi et al., 2008), since we did not find even a trend for improvement in trained participants on Raven's APM. Beyond statistical explanations, differences in the training paradigms used for the two studies may explain the differences in transfer effects. The training program used by Jaeggi et al. (2008) involved 400 trials per training session, with a dual n-back training paradigm designed to emphasize binding processes and task management. Conversely, our training paradigm included only 32 trials per session and more heavily emphasized maintenance in the face of distraction. Finally, the seemingly conflicting results may be due to differences in intelligence test administration. As was pointed out in a recent critique (Moody, 2009), Jaeggi et al. (2008) used atypical speeded procedures in administering their tests of fluid intelligence, and these alterations may have confounded the apparent effect of WM training on intelligence."

### Seidler 2010

["Cognitive Training As An Intervention To Improve Driving Ability In The Older Adult"](http://m-castl.org/files/2010-01SeidlerReport.pdf) ([local copy](docs/seidler2010.pdf)), a [technical report](!Wikipedia) by a group which includes Susanne Jaeggi, studied the effect of DNB on the driving ability of younger/older adults. As part of the before/after test battery, a Raven's was administered:

> "Type 2 tests included Raven’s matrices (Raven et al., 1990), which is a standardized test of fluid intelligence, and the BOMAT and verbal analogies tests of intelligence (Hossiep et al., 1995). We have previously shown that working memory training transfers to performance on this task (Jaeggi et al., 2008), and we included it here for the sake of replication."

They found the [null result](!Wikipedia):

> "There were no significant group by test session interactions for the intelligence measures or complex motor tasks for the young adults, although one of the intelligence measures exhibited a trend for transfer effects that scaled with training task gains.
>
> ...
>
> Unlike in our previous work (Jaeggi et al., 2008) we did not observe transfer to measures of intelligence. This may have been a by-product of the rather extensive pre and post test battery of assessments that we performed, particularly given that one of the intelligence measures was always performed last in the sequence of tests. Given this, participants may have been too fatigued and / or unmotivated to perform these tests well."

### Colom 2010

["Improvement in working memory is not related to increased intelligence scores"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2010.06.008) ([full text](docs/colom2010.pdf)) trained 173 students on WM tasks (such as the [reading span task](!Wikipedia)) with randomized difficulties, and found no linked IQ improvement; the IQ tests were "the Advanced Progressive Matrices Test (APM) along with the abstract reasoning (DAT-AR), verbal reasoning (DAT-VR), and spatial relations (DAT-SR) subtests from the Differential Aptitude Test Battery". None were speeded as in Jaeggi 2008. Abstract:

> "The acknowledged high relationship between working memory and intelligence suggests common underlying cognitive mechanisms and, perhaps, shared biological substrates. If this is the case, improvement in working memory by repeated exposure to challenging span tasks might be reflected in increased intelligence scores. Here we report a study in which 288 university undergraduates completed the odd numbered items of four intelligence tests on time 1 and the even numbered items of the same tests one month later (time 2). In between, 173 participants completed three sessions, separated by exactly one week, comprising verbal, numerical, and spatial short-term memory (STM) and working memory (WMC) tasks imposing high processing demands (STM–WMC group). 115 participants also completed three sessions, separated by exactly one week, but comprising verbal, numerical, and spatial simple speed tasks (processing speed, PS, and attention, ATT) with very low processing demands (PS-ATT group). The main finding reveals increased scores from the pre-test to the post-test intelligence session (more than half a standard deviation on average). However, there was no differential improvement on intelligence between the STM-WMC and PS-ATT groups."

Commentators on the [ML discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/dfefba647545fb57) criticized the study for:

1. Not using DNB itself
2. apparently little training time on the WM tasks (3 sessions over weeks, each of unclear duration)
3. the randomization of difficulty (as opposed to DNB's adaptiveness)
4. the large increase in scores on the WM tasks over the 3 sessions (suggesting growing familiarity than real challenge & growth)
5. and the statistical observation that if IQ gains were linear with training and started small then 173 participants is not enough to observe with confidence any improvements.

## Saccading

 One fascinating psychology result is that strongly [right-handed](!Wikipedia "Right-handedness") people can improve their memory (and possibly N-back performance) by simply taking 30 seconds and flicking ("[saccading](!Wikipedia "saccade")") their eyes left and right (for a summary, see ["A quick eye-exercise can improve your performance on memory tests (but only if you're right-handed)"](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/04/a_quick_eye-exercise_can_impro.php).

Version 4.5 of Brain Workshop includes a saccading feature: a dot alternates sides of the screen and one is to follow it with one's eyes. (You activate it by pressing 'e'. It's not a bad idea to alternate rounds of N-back with rounds of saccading.)

Ashirgo [writes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3e9b194bd55401d6) that her previous advice encompasses this eye-movement result; Pheonexia reports that after trying the saccading before a BW session, he 'performed better than I ever have before'.

The most recent study on this effect seems to be ["Eye movements enhance memory for individuals who are strongly right-handed and harm it for individuals who are not"](http://louisville.edu/psychology/lyle/LyleLogan-RoedigerPB-R2008.pdf). It says:

> "Subjects who make repetitive saccadic eye movements before a memory test subsequently exhibit superior retrieval in comparison with subjects who do not move their eyes. It has been proposed that eye movements enhance retrieval by increasing interaction of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. To test this, we compared the effect of eye movements on subsequent recall (Experiment1) and recognition (Experiment2) in two groups thought to differ in baseline degree of hemispheric interaction—individuals who are strongly right-handed (SR) and individuals who are not (nSR). For SR subjects, who naturally may experience less hemispheric interaction than nSR subjects, eye movements enhanced retrieval. In contrast, depending on the measure, eye movements were either inconsequential or even detrimental for nSR subjects. These results partially support the hemispheric interaction account, but demand an amendment to explain the harmful effects of eye movements for nSR individuals."

(Note that very important caveat: this is a useful technique *only* for strongly right-handed people; weak righties and lefties are outright harmed by this technique.)

## Sleep

["Sleep Accelerates the Improvement in Working Memory Performance"](docs/kuriyama2008-sleep-improves-nback.pdf) ([abstract](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/40/10145), ([PDF](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/10145.pdf)), Kuriyama, _The Journal of Neuroscience_, October 1, 2008 • 28(40):10145–10150:

> "Working memory (WM) performance, which is an important factor for determining problem-solving and reasoning ability, has been firmly believed to be constant. However, recent findings have demonstrated that WM performance has the potential to be improved by repetitive training. Although various skills are reported to be improved by sleep, the beneficial effect of sleep on WM performance has not been clarified. Here, we show that improvement in WM performance is facilitated by posttraining naturalistic sleep. A spatial variant of the _n_-back WM task was performed by 29 healthy young adults who were assigned randomly to three different experimental groups that had different time schedules of repetitive _n_-back WM task sessions, with or without intervening sleep. Intergroup and intersession comparisons of WM performance (accuracy and response time) profiles showed that n-back accuracy after posttraining sleep was significantly improved compared with that after the same period of wakefulness, independent of sleep timing, subject’s vigilance level, or circadian influences. On the other hand, response time was not influenced by sleep or repetitive training schedules. The present study indicates that improvement in _n_-back accuracy, which could reflect WM capacity, essentially benefits from posttraining sleep."

(In this test, the baseline/unpracticed performance of the two groups was the same; but the schedule in which subjects trained at 10 PM and went to bed resulted in greater improvements in performance than schedules in which subjects trained when they got up at 8 AM and went to bed ~10 PM.)

## Lucid dreaming

[Stephen LaBerge](!Wikipedia), pioneer of [lucid dreaming](!Wikipedia) writes^["The Psychophysiology of Lucid Dreaming", collected in _Conscious Mind, Sleeping Brain_,]

> "Why then is CNS activation necessary for lucid dreaming? Evidently the high level of cognitive function involved in lucid dreaming requires a correspondingly high level of neuronal activation. In terms of Antrobus's (1986) adaptation of Anderson's (1983) ACT* model of cognition to dreaming, working memory capacity is proportional to cognitive activation, which in turn is proportional to cortical activation. Becoming lucid requires an adequate level of working memory to active the presleep intention to recognize that one is dreaming. This level of activation is apparently not always available during sleep but normally only during phasic REM."

[Allan Hobson](!Wikipedia) has apparently speculated^[pg 97 of his book _The Dream Drugstore_ (2001)] that WM and the prefrontal cortex is partially de-activated during REM sleep and this is why dreamers do not realize they are dreaming - the same region that n-back tasks activate.[^fmri] The suggestion then goes that n-back training will enable greater dream recognition & recall, which are crucial skills for any would-be lucid dreamer.

[^fmri]: ["Differential dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during a verbal n-back task according to sensory modality"](http://www.fmri.uji.es/publications/nback_audi_visual.pdf); abstract:

     > "Functional neuroimaging studies carried out on healthy volunteers while performing different n-back tasks have shown a common pattern of bilateral frontoparietal activation, especially of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Our objective was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the pattern of brain activation while performing two similar n-back tasks which differed in their presentation modality. Thirteen healthy volunteers completed a verbal 2-back task presenting auditory stimuli, and a similar 2-back task presenting visual stimuli. A conjunction analysis showed bilateral activation of frontoparietal areas including the DLPFC. The left DLPFC and the superior temporal gyrus showed a greater activation in the auditory than in the visual condition, whereas posterior brain regions and the anterior cingulate showed a greater activation during the visual than during the auditory task. Thus, brain areas involved in the visual and auditory versions of the n-back task showed an important overlap between them, reﬂecting the supramodal characteristics of working memory. However, the differences found between the two modalities should be considered in order to select the most appropriate task for future clinical studies."

On the other hand, I have seen anecdotal reports that *any* intense mental exercise or learning causes increased dreaming, even if the exercise is domain-specific (eg. the famous [Tetris effect](!Wikipedia)) or just memorization (as in use of [Mnemosyne]() spaced repetition), and LaBerge also remarks (pg 165 of _Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming_):

> "Most people assume that a major function of sleeping and dreaming is rest and recuperation. This popular con-ception has been upheld by research. Thus, for humans, physical exercise leads to more sleep, especially delta sleep. Growth hormone, which triggers growth in children and the repair of stressed tissues, is released in delta sleep. On the other hand, mental exercise or emotional stress appears to result in increases in REM sleep and dreaming."

## Aging

Working memory and processing speed are traits that decline considerably over one's lifetime; the following image was adapted by [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/#!5495086/this-is-your-faulty-brain-on-a-microchip) from a study of age-related decline, ["Models of visuospatial and verbal memory across the adult life span"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12061414)^[Abstract: "The authors investigated the distinctiveness and interrelationships among visuospatial and verbal memory processes in short-term, working, and long-term memories in 345 adults. Beginning in the 20s, a continuous, regular decline occurs for processing-intensive tasks (e.g., speed of processing, working memory, and long-term memory), whereas verbal knowledge increases across the life span. There is little differentiation in the cognitive architecture of memory across the life span. Visuospatial and verbal working memory are distinct but highly interrelated systems with domain-specific short-term memory subsystems. In contrast to recent neuroimaging data, there is little evidence for dedifferentiation of function at the behavioral level in old compared with young adults." That the neuroimaging shows no change in general locations of activity is probably interpretable as the lower performance being due to general low-level problems and inefficiencies of age, and not the elderly's brains starting to 'unlearn' specific tasks.] ([PDF](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.167.6787&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). The units are [z-scores](!Wikipedia "Standard score"), units of standard deviations (so for the 80 year olds to be two full units below the 20 year olds indicates a profound fall in the averages):

![](/images/2011-gizmodo-brainage.jpg)

Another 2011 study testing 2000 individuals between 18 and 60 found that "Top performances in some of the tests were accomplished at the age of 22. A notable decline in certain measures of abstract reasoning, brain speed and in puzzle-solving became apparent at 27."^[["Cognitive Decline Begins In Late 20s, Study Suggests"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090320092111.htm), _Science Daily_] (Of course, like the previous study, a correlation over many individuals of varying ages [is not as good](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680669/) as having a series of performance measurements for one aging individual. But time will cure that fault, hopefully.) The [abstract](http://www.neurobiologyofaging.org/article/S0197-4580%2809%2900021-9/abstract) ([full text](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683339/)) of this Salthouse study says:

> "...Results from three methods of estimating retest effects in this project, together with results from studies comparing non-human animals raised in constant environments and from studies examining neurobiological variables not susceptible to retest effects, converge on a conclusion that some aspects of age-related cognitive decline begin in healthy educated adults when they are in their 20s and 30s."

From the optimistic perspective, Salthouse tested Fortune 500 CEOs and found that their membership by average age didn't start dropping until their 60s, suggesting that they remained reasonably mentally sharp or were, in practice, compensating for the many insults of age.[^ceos]

[^ceos]: ["This Is Your Brain. Aging. Science is reshaping what we know about getting older. (The news is better than you think.)"](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/18/this-is-your-brain-aging.print.html), _Newsweek_:

    > "The [Salthouse] graph shows two roller-coastering lines. One represents the proportion of people of each age who are in the top 25 percent on a standard lab test of reasoning ability—thinking. The other shows the proportion of CEOs of [Fortune 500](!Wikipedia) companies of each age. Reasoning ability peaks at about age 28 and then plummets, tracing that well-known plunge that makes those older than 30 (OK, fine, 40) cringe: only 6 percent of top scorers are in their 50s, and only 4 percent are in their 60s. But the age distribution of CEOs is an almost perfect mirror image: it peaks just before age 60. About half are older than 55. And the number under 40 is about zero.
    >
    > ...Salt-house deduces more counterintuitive, and hopeful, lessons. The first is that in real life, rather than in psych labs, people rely on mental abilities that stand up very well to age and discover work-arounds for the mental skills that do fade."

> "There are several studies showing that working memory and intelligence are strongly related. However, working memory tasks require simultaneous processing and storage, so the causes of their relationship with intelligence are currently a matter of discussion. The present study examined the simultaneous relationships among short-term memory (STM), working memory (WM), and general intelligence (_g_). Two hundred and eight participants performed six verbal, quantitative, and spatial STM tasks, six verbal, quantitative, and spatial WM tasks, and eight tests measuring fluid, crystallized, spatial, and quantitative intelligence. Especial care is taken to avoid misrepresenting the relations among the constructs being studied because of specific task variance. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results revealed that (a) WM and g are (almost) isomorphic constructs, (b) the isomorphism vanishes when the storage component of WM is partialed out, and (c) STM and WM (with its storage component partialed out) predict _g_."

- Colom et al. "General intelligence and memory span: Evidence for a common neuroanatomic framework"; _Cognitive Neuropsychology_, Volume 24, Issue 8 December 2007 , pages 867 - 878

> "General intelligence (_g_) is highly correlated with working-memory capacity (WMC). It has been argued that these central psychological constructs should share common neural systems. The present study examines this hypothesis using structural magnetic resonance imaging to determine any overlap in brain areas where regional grey matter volumes are correlated to measures of general intelligence and to memory span. In normal volunteers (N = 48) the results (p < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) indicate that a common anatomic framework for these constructs implicates mainly frontal grey matter regions belonging to Brodmann area (BA) 10 (right superior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus) and, to a lesser degree, the right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40). These findings support the nuclear role of a discrete parieto-frontal network. "

## Offline N-back

You can play N-back in the real world, without a computer, if you like. See the ML thread ["Non-electronic game version of N-back task"](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/e85b55de47df536d) and the [SnapBack rules](http://www.toothycat.net/wiki/wiki.pl?DouglasReay/SnapBackGameRules). Jonathan  Toomin points out that N-back can be easily done with a deck of cards alone, and the FAQ's author [suggests](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1dc53aa5f88e5c81) a simple mental arithmetic routine suitable for meditation that is much like SNB.

# What else can I do?

Forum members have recommended a number of other things for general mental fitness:

- Buddhist-style [meditation](!Wikipedia) has been recommended (there is a good [Vipassana](!Wikipedia) textbook available online; see ["Mindfulness in Plain English"](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html), and the <http://openfocus.com/> website has been mentioned). Meditation has been [well-studied](!Wikipedia "Research on meditation") and shown to induce [physical changes](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8317-meditation-builds-up-the-brain.html) and [improve executive function & WM](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100414184220.htm), S2B performance ([local copy of Zeidan 2010](docs/zeidan2010.pdf)), attention^[Specifically, performance on [attentional blink](!Wikipedia); see ["Mental Training Affects Distribution of Limited Brain Resources"](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050138) (Slagter 2007); cf. ["Study Suggests Meditation Can Help Train Attention "](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/health/psychology/08medi.html) (_New York Times_).], and [cardiovascular health](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/120/18_MeetingAbstracts/S461-a)^[["Can Meditation Curb Heart Attacks?"](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/can-meditation-curb-heart-attacks/) (_New York Times_)] among many other results.
- [neurofeedback](!Wikipedia) can be similar to meditation and has been linked to physical changes in the brain;^[["First Direct Evidence of Neuroplastic Changes Following Brainwave Training"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100310114936.htm) & ["Mindfulness Meditation Training Changes Brain Structure in Eight Weeks"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110121144007.htm), _Science Daily_] [binaural beats](!Wikipedia) have also been discussed.
- [Spaced repetition](!Wikipedia) programs such as [Mnemosyne](!Wikipedia "Mnemosyne (software)") are very useful for memorizing & remembering things
- Crypto [recommends](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904) [image streaming](!Wikipedia) as another mental exercise
- UOchris1 [reports](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/18eeddd23451f1f0) very positive results while working through a mental exercise regimen developed by an American performer from the 1920s who specialized in doing multiple mental tasks simultaneously; he is using a Stand Magazine article on Harry Kahne and Kahne's ["The Multiple Mentality Course"](http://www.rexresearch.com/kahne/kahne.htm) as resources.
- One study claims that spatial ability is trainable and that there is transfer (from trained tasks to novel ones)[^spatial]. Suggested games include [4-D Rubik's Cube](http://www.superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm), [mental rotation](http://psych.hanover.edu/JavaTest/CLE/Cognition/Cognition/MentalRotation.html), [3-D Tetris](http://www.3dtris.de/), the [VZ-2 paper folding test](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_frm/thread/52d802a9df720962), and the [Cambridge Brain Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) suite of games/tasks.
- Exercise is right up there with nutrition and sleep!

## Supplements ([nootropics](!Wikipedia))

### Piracetam

A useful pharmaceutical is [piracetam](!Wikipedia); [TheQ17](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/e9074921a905a7fa) mentions that "Personally, I have found piracetam be quite useful in helping me stay alert and focused during long study hours or doing redundant tasks." [Other members](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4482aa213c8cbdf4/d1456393d7083660) also swear by piracetam+choline.

The author of this FAQ [reports that](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4f52e50ef2c0e64) piracetam and [choline](!Wikipedia) helped reduced mental fatigue and gave a small (~10%) increase in his D4B score.

### Huperzine

[Reece](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3de2bf7a8e70949c) writes

> "I've tried [huperzine](!Wikipedia) [a chemical extracted from an herb] (actually been using it for about a year now) and it is quite effective for both lucid dreaming and increasing dream recall if taken shortly before bed, not to mention the other benefits you'd expect from a potent [acetylcholinesterase](!Wikipedia) inhibitor. I haven't had anything in the way of negative side effects when I've stuck to a 5 day/week dosage of 200mcg.
>
> I've never tried piracetam, however [oxiracetam](!Wikipedia) felt like a placebo when compared to the benefits I've received from huperzine A. At larger doses, I've found huperzine A to be far more powerful than any nootropic I've ever tried (haven't tried any prescription meds such as [deprenyl](!Wikipedia)), however the side effects such as blurry vision and light-headedness weren't something I could tolerate."

He further compared their effects:

> 'I found Oxiracetam to have a somewhat "speedy" effect -- you would certainly know you
took something if someone slipped that in your drink! As for effects, Oxiracetam seemed to help most with verbal fluency (auditory working memory?) and creativity. Huperzine helped more with working memory although it didn't have some of the interesting effects Oxiracetam had on creativity, nor the speedy rush that sometimes seemed like a powerful motivator to get work done.'

(Reece did not take the oxiracetam with any choline supplements, which is usually recommended.)

### Miscellaneous
In the realm of unusual supplements to n-backing, we can include: ...

- [creatine](!Wikipedia); while creatine is famous for its athletic uses, it turns out to boost mental performance as well, and particularly performance while fatigued. There is a [thread](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fe4ee2f0c994e40e) discussing the research on creatine. The results are a little mixed^[[Rawson 2008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18579168) is a broad null result for healthy young omnivores who aren't idiots. Vegetarians, idiots, the sleep-deprived, and old people may benefit. For specific citations, see the thread.], but Jonathan Toomim recommends it highly, claiming that "I'm more confident that I've noticed effects [on mental performance] of  creatine than of DnB."

[^spatial]: _Psychonomic Bulletin & Review_ 2008 Aug;15(4):763-71. "Training generalized spatial skills." Wright R, Thompson WL, Ganis G, Newcombe NS, Kosslyn SM.

     > "...The present study investigated whether intensive long-term practice leads to change that transcends stimulus and task parameters. Thirty-one participants (14 male, 17 female) were tested on three cognitive tasks: a computerized version of the Shepard-Metzler (1971) mental rotation task (MRT), a mental paper-folding task (MPFT), and a verbal analogies task (VAT). Each individual then participated in daily practice sessions with the MRT or the MPFT over 21 days. Postpractice comparisons revealed transfer of practice gains to novel stimuli for the practiced task, as well as transfer to the other, nonpracticed spatial task. Thus, practice effects were process based, not instance based. Improvement in the nonpracticed spatial task was greater than that in the VAT; thus, improvement was not merely due to greater ease with computerized testing."
[^time]: I'm not the only one to notice this. 'y offs et' mentions during a [discussion of TNB](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/f70b31bab31fafc4/67a6717ba9b06988) that:

     > "It's interesting how doing n-back proves that time is relative and based upon our perception of its passing
     >
     > When I'm doing well, the next instance comes with metronome exactness as expected from a machine. When I'm resetting after a tricky double-back, the next instance always comes way too quickly, as if a second had been removed. The same perception happens on an upped level, and it is so persistent. It's like some time had vanished.
     >

    > "Differences in working memory capacity account for 50 to 70 percent of individual differences in fluid intelligence (abstract reasoning ability) in various meta-analyses, suggesting that it is one of the major building blocks of I.Q. (Ackerman et al; Kane et al; [Süss et al.](http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~psxko/Suess.et-al.2002.Intelligence.pdf)) This idea is intriguing because working memory can be improved by training."
[^size]: See [Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Working memory#Working memory capacity")
([stable version](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Working_memory&oldid=269488909)) on working memory size:

    > "Working memory is generally considered to have limited capacity. The earliest quantification of the capacity limit associated with short-term memory was the ["magical number seven"](!Wikipedia "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two")
 introduced by Miller (1956). He noticed that the memory span of young adults was around seven elements, called chunks, regardless whether the elements were digits, letters, words, or other units. Later research revealed that span does depend on the category of chunks used (e.g., span is around seven for digits, around six for letters, and around five for words), and even on features of the chunks within a category....Several other factors also affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan (2001) has proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and fewer in children and old adults)."

[^jaeggi2010]: from [Jaeggi2010](#jaeggi-2010):

     > "The findings of Study 1 confirm other findings from the literature (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Perrig, & Meier, 2010; Kane, Conway, Miura, & Colflesh, 2007): Consistent with our hypotheses, both n-back task variants were highly correlated, and both were best predicted by _Gf_.
     >
     > In general, matrix reasoning tasks seem to be better predictors for both the single and the dual n-back tasks than a measure of working memory capacity. As the reliability estimates were appropriate for the n-back tasks, the lack of correlation between the n-back tasks and the measure of working memory capacity cannot be attributed to insufficient reliability (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Perrig, & Meier, 2010). Rather, it
seems that performance for the two tasks relies on different sources of variance, which might result from the different memory processes that are involved in the two tasks: whereas the n-back task relies on passive recognition processes, performance in working memory capacity tasks requires active and strategic recall processes (Kane, Conway, Miura, & Colflesh, 2007)."

     > "In a longitudinal study of 140 eighth-grade students, self-discipline measured by self-report, parent report, teacher report, and monetary choice questionnaires in the fall predicted final grades, school attendance, standardized achievement-test scores, and selection into a competitive high school program the following spring. In a replication with 164 eighth graders, a behavioral delay-of-gratification task, a questionnaire on study habits, and a group-administered IQ test were added. Self-discipline measured in the fall accounted for more than twice as much variance as IQ in final grades, high school selection, school attendance, hours spent doing homework, hours spent watching television (inversely), and the time of day students began their homework. The effect of self-discipline on final grades held even when controlling for first-marking-period grades, achievement-test scores, and measured IQ. These findings suggest a major reason for students falling short of their intellectual potential: their failure to exercise self-discipline."

    > "Fluid intelligence involves novel problem-solving and may be susceptible to poor sleep. This study examined relationships between adolescent sleep, fluid intelligence, and academic achievement. Participants were 217 adolescents (42% male) aged 13 to 18 years (mean age, 14.9 years; SD = 1.0) in grades 9–11.

Total sleep time was not significantly related to fluid intelligence nor academic achievement (both _P_ > 0.05); however, sleep difficulty (e.g. difficulty initiating sleep, unrefreshing sleep) was related to both (_P_ < 0.05)..."

    > "Performance on task switching, a paradigm commonly used to measure executive function, has been shown to improve with practice. However, no study has tested whether these benefits are specific to the tasks learned or are transferable to new situations. We report evidence of transferable improvement in a cued, randomly switching paradigm as measured by mixing cost, but we report no consistent improvement for switch cost. Improvement in mixing costs arises from a relative reduction in time to perform both switch and nonswitch trials that immediately follow switch trials, implicating the ability to recover from unexpected switches as the source of improvement. These results add to a growing number of studies demonstrating generalizable improvement with training on executive processing."

PDF available in Group Files.

    A more recent result is the fMRI study [Chein 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20691275), "Domain-general mechanisms of complex working memory span", which abstract says "For both verbal and spatial versions of the task, complex working memory span performance increased the activity in lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortices during the Encoding, Maintenance, and Coordination phase of task performance. Meanwhile, overlapping activity in anterior prefrontal and medial temporal lobe regions was associated with both verbal and spatial recall from working memory."

    > "However, as shown in Fig. 2, the correlations between solution accuracy for each item and Ospan, although fluctuating widely, does not appear to increase in any systematic manner as difficulty increases. Indeed, the correlation between Ospan and accuracy on the first problem was as high as with problem 24 (i.e., problem 1 r=0.26, problem 24 r=0.26). These results are strikingly similar to those of Salthouse (1993) who showed roughly the same pattern of correlations between solution accuracy and a WM composite. Both sets of results suggest that there is not a clear relationship between item variations in difficulty on Raven and measures of WM.

    > ...Although there seems to be adequate variability for quartile 4, this low correlation is probably due to the fact that not as many subjects attempted these problems. Indeed, 80% of participants attempted the first 27 problems, but only 47% of participants finished the test. Thus, only quartiles 1–3 should be interpreted. With this in mind, the results demonstrate that the correlation between solution accuracy and Ospan does not increase as difficulty increases but instead remains fairly constant across increasing levels of difficulty.

    > ...One reviewer was concerned that only high working memory capacity individuals would finish the test. However, of those participants classified as high working memory (one standard deviation above the mean on Ospan), only 25% of them actually finished the test, whereas 71% of those classified as low working memory (one standard deviation below the mean on Ospan) finished the test. This results in somewhat lower scores for these 76 individuals on the two measures as compared the full sample (i.e. M Ospan=11.12, S.D.=5.90; M Raven=17.50, S.D.=7.59)."

    > "Recently, attempts have been made to alter the capacity of working memory (WMC) through extensive practice on adaptive working memory tasks that adjust difficulty in response to user performance. We discuss the design criteria required to claim validity as well as generalizability and how recent studies do or do not satisfy those criteria. It is concluded that, as of yet, the results are inconsistent and this is likely driven by inadequate controls and ineffective measurement of the cognitive abilities of interest."

    >
    > [`Douglas Crockford`](!Wikipedia): "I used to think so. A few years ago I had [sleep apnea](!Wikipedia), but I didn't know it. I thought I was just getting tired and old, and I got to the point where it was so difficult to concentrate that I couldn't program anymore because I just couldn't keep enough stuff in my head. A lot of programming is you keep stuff in your head until you can get it written down and structured properly. And I just couldn't do it.
    >
    > I had lost that ability and I thought it was just because I was getting older. Fortunately, I got better and it came back and so I'm programming again. I'm doing it well and maybe a little bit better now because I've learned how not to depend so much on my memory. I'm better at documenting my code now than I used to be because I'm less confident that I'll remember next week why I did this. In fact, sometimes I'll be going through my stuff and I'm amazed at stuff that I had written: I don't remember having done it and it's either really either awful or brilliant. I had no idea I was capable of that."

    From pg 154:

    > `Seibel`: "How do you design code?"
    >
    > [`Brendan Eich`](!Wikipedia): "A lot of prototyping. I used to do sort of high-level pseudocode, and then I'd start filling in bottom up. I do less of the high-level pseudocode because I can usually hold it in my head and just do bottom-up until it joins.
    >
    > Often I'm working with existing pieces of code adding some new subsystem or something on the side and I can almost do it bottom-up. When I get in trouble in the middle I do still write pseudo-code and just start working bottom up until I can complete it. I try not to let that take too long because you've got to be able to test it; you've got to be able to see it run and step through it and make sure it's doing what it's supposed to be doing."

    From pg 202, a cogent reminder that 'tis a good wind that blows no ill (and that as William T. Powers wrote somewhere on the [CSGNet ML](http://www.perceptualcontroltheory.org/email_list.html), "Some people revel in complexity, and what's worse, they have the brain power to deal with vast systems of arcane equations. This ability can be a handicap because it leads to overlooking simple solutions."):

    > `Seibel`: "Speaking of writing intricate code, I've noticed that people who are too smart, in a certain dimension anyway, make the worst code. Because they can actually fit the whole thing in their head they can write these great reams of spaghetti code."
    >
    > [`Joshua Bloch`](!Wikipedia): "I agree with you that people who are both smart enough to cope with enormous complexity and lack empathy with the rest of us may fall prey to that. They think, 'I can understand this and I can use it, so it has to be good.'"

    > `Seibel`: "Bill Gates once claimed that he could still go to a blackboard and write out big chunks of the code to the BASIC that he written for the Altair, a decade or so after he had originally written it. Do you think you can remember your old code that way?"

    From page 246:

    > [`Simon Peyton Jones`](!Wikipedia): "Yeah, that's right. So essentially we wrote out our types by drawing them on large sheets of papers with arrows. That was our type system. That was a pretty large program—in fact it was over ambitious; we never completed it."

    > `Seibel`: "Do you think you learned any lessons from that failure?"
    >
    > `Peyton Jones`: "That was probably when I first became aware that writing a really big program you could end up with problems of scale—you couldn't keep enough of it in your head at the same time. Previously all the things I had written, you could keep the whole thing in your head without any trouble. So it was probably the first time I'd done any serious attempt at long-standing documentation."

    > `Seibel`: "But even that wasn't enough, in this case..."

    From page 440:

    > [[David Deutsch](!Wikipedia):] "The second reason I like Python is that—and maybe this is just the way my brain has changed over the years—I can't keep as much stuff in my head as I used to. It's more important for me to have stuff in front of my face. So the fact that in Smalltalk you effectively cannot put more than one method on the screen at a time drives me nuts. As far as I'm concerned the fact that I edit Python programs with Emacs is an advantage because I can see more than ten lines' worth at a time."
