# What is N-back anyway?

See my article on [N-back]() in general. It's mental training intended to improve your intelligence, and specifically your [working memory](!Wikipedia).

## Terminology

N-back training is sometimes referred to simply as 'N-backing', and participants in such training are called 'N-backers'. Almost everyone uses the Free, featureful & portable program [Brain Workshop](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/), abbreviated "BW" (but see [the software section](#Software) for alternatives).

There are many variants of N-back training. A 3-letter acronym ending in 'B' specifies one of the possibilities. For example, 'D2B' and 'D6B' both refer to a dual N-back task, but in the former the depth of recall is 2 turns, while in the latter one must remember back 6 rounds; the 'D', for 'Dual', indicates that each round presents 2 stimuli (usually the position of the square, and a spoken letter).

But one can add further stimuli: spoken letter, position of square, and *color* of square. That would be 'Triple N-back', and so one might speak of how one is doing on 'T4B'. 

One can go further. Spoken letter, position, color, and *geometric shape*. This would be 'Quad N-back', so one might discuss one's performance on 'Q3B'. (It's unclear how to compare the various modes, but it seems to be much harder to go from D2B to T3B than to go from D2B to D3B.)

Currently, Quad is the highest Brain Workshop supports; Paul (BW's developer) [writes](http://groups.google.com/grop/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/e09d8248376a978d) that a 'Pent' mode

> "would require not-insignificant changes to the code (the addition of another modality) but this seems to be the next logical progression. I'll look into this after the official release of 4.6."

Pentuple N-back (PNB) is largely complete; one can see a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efSxgA7EpGk) of it. The 5th modality is added by a second audio channel - that is, now sounds are in stereo.

Other abbreviations are in common use: 'WM' for 'working memory', 'Gf' for '[fluid intelligence](!Wikipedia)', and 'g' for the [general intelligence factor](!Wikipedia "General intelligence factor") measured by IQ tests.

# Notes from the author

## N-back in general

To those whose time is limited: you may wish to stop reading here. If you seek to improve your life, and want the greatest 'bang for the buck', you are well-advised to look elsewhere.

Meditation, for example, is easier, faster, and ultra-portable. Typing training will directly improve your facility with a computer, a valuable skill for this modern world. [Spaced repetition](!Wikipedia) memorization techniques offer unparalleled advantages to students. [Nootropics](!Wikipedia) are the epitome of ease (just swallow!), and their effects are much more easily assessed - one can even run double-blind experiments on oneself, impossible with dual N-back. Other supplements like [melatonin](!Wikipedia) can deliver benefits incommensurable with DNB - what is the value of an extra hour of sleep compared to another slot in working memory?  Modest changes to one's diet and environs can fundamentally improve one's wellbeing. Even basic training in reading, with the crudest [tachistoscope](!Wikipedia) techniques, can pay large dividends if one is, say, below a basic level of reading like 200[WPM](!Wikipedia) & still subvocalizing. And all of these can start paying off immediately.

DNB, on the other hand, requires a minimum of 15 hours before one can expect genuine somatic improvements. The task itself is unproven - the Jaeggi studies are suggestive, not definitive. Programs for DNB training rely essentially on guesswork as they explore the large design-space; there are no data on what features are essential, what sort of presentation optimal, or even how long or when to train for. The task itself is unenjoyable. It can be wearying, difficult & embarrassing.

So why then do I, at least, persevere with DNB?

I do it because I find it fascinating. Fascinating that WM can be so large a part of IQ; fascinating that it can be increased by an apparently trivial exercise. I'm fascinated that there are measurable gross changes in brain chemistry & activity - that the effects are not purely 'mental' or placebo. I'm fascinated by how the sequence of positions and letters can at some times appear in my mind with boundless lucidity, yet at other times I grope confused in a mental murk unsure of even what the last position/letter was - even though I can rise from my computer and go about normal activities normally; or with how time can stretch and compress during N-backing[^time]. I'm fascinated by how a single increase in _n_-level can render the task nightmarishly difficult when I just finished _n-1_ at 90 or 100%. I'm fascinated by how saccading, another apparently trivial exercise, can reliably boost my score by 10 or 20%, and how my mind seems to be fagged after just a few rounds but recovers within minutes. I'm equally fascinated by the large literature on WM: what it is, what's it good for, how it can be manipulated, etc.

I do not think that DNB is terribly practical - but interesting? Very.

## Using this FAQ

This FAQ is almost solely my own work. I've striven to make it fair, to incorporate most of the relevant research, and to not omit things. But inevitably I will have made errors or important omissions. You must read this skeptically.

You must read this skeptically also because the N-back community formed around the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training) *is* a community. That means it is prone to all the biases and issues of a community. One would expect a community formed around a technique or practice to be made up only of people who find value in it; any material (like this FAQ or included testimonials) is automatically suspect. Imagine if scientists published only papers which showed new results, and no papers reporting failure to replicate! Why would any N-backer hang around who had discovered that DNB was not useful or a fraud? Certainly the fans would not thank him. ([Eliezer Yudkowsky](!Wikipedia) has an excellent essay called ["Evaporative Cooling of Group Beliefs"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/) on just this topic.)

Finally, you must read skeptically because this is about psychology. Psychology is notoriously for being one of the hardest scientific fields to get solid results in, because everybody is weird and different. As one of my professors joked, if you have 2 psychology papers reporting the same effect, one of them is wrong. It's very tempting to engage in  ["Generalizing From One Example"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) but you mustn't. Everybody is different; your positive (or negative) result could be due to a [placebo effect](!Wikipedia), it could be thanks to that recent shift in your sleep schedule, it could be the exercise you're getting, it could be a mild [seasonal depression](!Wikipedia "Seasonal affective disorder") lifting (or setting in), it could be a [calcium deficiency](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15w/experiential_pica/), etc.

# N-back training

## Should I do multiple daily sessions, or just one?

[Most users](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e989058544ad122) seem to go for one long N-back session, pointing out that exercises one's focus. Others do one session in the morning and one in the evening so they can focus better on each one. There is some scientific support for the idea that evening sessions are better than morning sessions, though; see the [section](#sleep) on the sleep research.

If you break up sessions into more than 2, you're probably wasting time due to overhead, and may not be getting enough exercise in each session to really strain yourself like you need to.

## Strategies

The simplest mental strategy, and perhaps the most common, is to mentally think of a list, and forget the last one each round, remembering the newest in its place. This begins to break down on higher levels - if one is repeating the list mentally, the repetition can just take too long.

Surcer writes up a list of strategies for different levels in his ["My System, let's share strategies"](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/cf11964a87ed658c) thread.

### Are strategies good or bad?

People [frequently](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fd08b93399939fb9) [ask](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d779edc2b922db95) [and](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/676676a8e34f56d3) [discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/c4eaff3059759531) whether they should use some sort of strategy, and if so, what.

A number of N-backers adopt an 'intuition' strategy. Rather than explicitly rehearsing sequences of letters ('f-up, h-middle; f-up, h-middle; g-down, f-up...'), they simply think very hard and wait for a feeling that they should press 'a' (audio match), or 'l' (location match). Some, like SwedishChef can be quite vociferous [about it](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d779edc2b922db95):

> "The challenges are in helping people understand that dual-n-back is NOT about remembering n number of visual and auditory stimuli.  It's about developing a new mental process that intuitively recognizes when it has seen or heard a stimuli n times ago."\
> "Initially, most students of dual n-back want to remember n items as fast as they can so they can conquer the dual-n-back hill.  They use their own already developed techniques to help them remember.  They may try to hold the images in their head mentally and review them every time a new image is added and say the sounds out loud and review the sounds everytime a new sound is added.  This is NOT what we want.  We want the brain to learn a new process that intuitively recognizes if an item and sound was shown 3 back or 4 back.  It's sort of like playing a new type of musical instrument.\
> I've helped some students on the site try to understand this.  It's not about how much you can remember, it's about learning a new process.  In theory, this new process translates into a better working memory, which helps you make connections better and faster."

Other N-backers think that intuition can't work, or at least doesn't very well:

> "I don't believe that much in the "intuitive" method. I mean, sure, you can intuitively remember you heard the same letter or saw the square at the same position a few times ago, but I fail to see how you can "feel" it was exactly 6 or 7 times ago without some kind of "active" remembering." --[Gaël DEEST](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/716bd6f8c10be52e/8c9c126767d0f662)

> "I totally agree with Gaël about the intuitive method not holding much water...For me a lot of times the intuitive method can be totally unreliable. You'll be doing 5-back one game and a few games later your failing miserably at 3-back..your score all over the place. Plus, intuitive-wise, it's best to play the same n-back level over and over because then you train your intuition...and that doesn't seem right." --MikeM (same thread)

Few N-backers have systematically tracked intuitive versus strategic playing; [DarkAlrx](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1dff0955c27d25eb) reports on his [blog](http://darkmindexperiment.blogspot.com/2009/04/neurogenesis-experimentdark-side.html) the results of his experiment, and while he considers them positive, others find them inconclusive, or like Pheonexia, even unfavorable for the intuitive approach:

> "Looking at your graphs and the overall drop in your performance, I
> think it's clear that intuitive doesn't work. On your score sheet, the
> first picture, using the intuitive method over 38 days of TNB training
> in 44 days your average n-back increased by less than .25. You were
> performing much better before. With your neurogenesis experiment, your
> average n-back actually decreased."

Jaeggi herself is [more moderate](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/08bc4ee2ccd0df80):

> "I would NOT recommend you [train the visual and auditory task separately] if you want to train the dual-task (the one we used in our study). The reason is that the combination of both modalities is an entirely different task than doing both separately! If you do the task separately, I assume you use some "rehearsal strategies", e.g. you repeat the letters or positions for yourself. In the dual-task version however, these strategies might be more difficult to apply (since you have to do 2 things simultaneously...), and that is exactly what we want... We don't want to train strategies, we want to train processes. Processes that then might help you in the performance of other, non-trained tasks (and that is our ultimate goal). So, it is not important to reach a 7- or 8-back... It is important to fully focus your attention on the task as well as possible.\
> "I can assure you, it is a very tough training regimen.... You can't divert your attention even 1 second (I'm sure you have noticed...). But eventually, you will see that you get better at it and maybe you notice that you are better able to concentrate on certain things, to remember things more easily, etc. (hopefully)."

> "this is a question i am being asked a lot and unfortunately, i don't really know whether i can help with that. i can only tell you what we tell (or rather not tell) our participants and what they tell us. so, first of all, we don't tell people at all what strategy to use - it is up to them. thing is, there are some people that tell us what you describe above, i.e. some of them tell us that it works best if they don't use a strategy at all and just "let the squares/letters flow by". but of course, many participants also use more conscious strategies like rehearsing or grouping items together. but again - we let people chose their strategies themselves!"[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/955524caaf2e9001)

But it may make no difference. Even if you are engaged in a complex mnemonic-based strategy, you're still working your memory. Strategies may not even work; quoting from Jaeggi's 2008 paper:

> "By this account, one reason for having obtained transfer between working memory and measures of _Gf_ is that our training procedure may have facilitated the ability to control attention. This ability would come about because the constant updating of memory representations with the presentation of each new stimulus requires the engagement of mechanisms to shift attention. Also, our training task discourages the development of simple task-specific strategies that can proceed in the absence of controlled allocation of attention."

Hopefully even if a trick lets you jump from 3-back to 5-back, Brain Workshop will just keep escalating the difficulty until you are challenged again. It's not the level you reach, but the work you do.

## And the flashing right/wrong feedback?

A matter of preference, although those in favor of disabling the visual feedback (`SHOW_FEEDBACK = False`) seem to be [slightly](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/775fba46e8c163f1) [more](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/420f332fcd4317c9) vocal or numerous. Brain Twister [apparently](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/a8934cc1e04075f9) doesn't give feedback. [Jaeggi says](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/955524caaf2e9001):

> "the gaming literature also disagrees on this issue - there are different ways to think about this: whereas feedback after each trial gives you immediate feedback whether you did right or wrong, it can also be distracting as you are constantly monitoring (and evaluating) your performance. we decided that we wanted people to fully and maximally concentrate on the task itself and thus chose the approach to only give feedback at the end of the run. however, we have newer versions of the task for kids in which we give some sort of feedback (points) for each trial. thus - i can't tell you what the optimal way is - i guess there are interindividual differences and preferences as well."

## How can I do better on N-back?

Focus harder. Play more. Sleep well, and eat healthily. The less stressed you are, the better you can do.

### Hardcore

Curtis Warren has [noticed](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/7ec15b99a2a1a2f0) that when he underwent a 4-day routine of practicing more than 4 hours a day, he jumped an entire level on even quad N-back^["With regards to changes in n-back level, I went up about 1 solid level on all the tasks that I trained. That is, I went from 7 to 8 for dual, 6 to 7 for position-sound-color, 6 to 7 for position-sound-shape, and 4 to 5 on quad. I don't use any strategies."]:

> "For example, over the past week I have been trying a new training routine. My goal was to increase my intelligence as quickly as possible. To that end, over the past 4 days I've done a total of roughly 360 sessions @ 2 seconds per trial (= ~360 minutes of training). I had to rest on Wednesday, and I'm resting again today (I only plan on doing about 40 trials today). But I intend to finish off the week by doing 100 sessions on Saturday and another 100 on Sunday. Or more, if I can manage it."

But he cautions us that besides being a considerable time investment, it may only work for him:

> "The point is, while I can say without a doubt that this schedule has been effective _for me_, it might not be effective _for you_. Are the benefits worth the amount of work needed? Will you even notice an improvement? Is this healthy? These are all factors which depend entirely upon the individual actually _doing_ the training."

Raman started DNB training, and in his first 30 days, he "took breaks every 5 days or so, and was doing about 20-30 session each day and n-back wise I made good gains (from 2 to 7 touching 9 on the way)."; he kept a journal [on the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/9f3b791ee0fb1c38) about the experience with daily updates.

Alas, neither Raman nor Warren took an IQ or digit-span test before starting, so they can only report DNB level increases & subjective assessments.

## Am I wasting time if I can't get past 3-back?

Not at all! The crucial thing about N-back is just that you are stressing your working memory, that's all. The actual level doesn't matter very much, just whether you can barely manage it; it is somewhat like lifting weights, in that regard. From Jaeggi 2008:

> "The finding that the transfer to _Gf_ remained even after taking the specific training effect into account seems to be counterintuitive, especially because the specific training effect is also related to training time. The reason for this capacity might be that participants with a very high level of n at the end of the training period may have developed very task specific strategies, which obviously boosts n-back performance, but may prevent transfer because these strategies remain too task-specific (5, 20). The averaged n-back level in the last session is therefore not critical to predicting a gain in _Gf_; rather, it seems that working at the capacity limit promotes transfer to _Gf_."

Mailing list members [report benefits](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/eacf724158e04506) even if they have plateaued at 3 or 4-back; see the [benefits section](#Benefits).

## I heard 12-back is possible

Some users have reported being able to go all the way up to 12-back; Ashirgo [regularly plays](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/373089e3e049707b/5dbde0450a4d44ca) at D13B, but the highest at other modes seems to be T9B and Q6B.

Ashirgo [offers up](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/72aa2de2fdf75edf/6c777b2646227c38?q) her 8-point scheme as to how to accomplish such feats:

> 1. 'Be focused at all cost. The fluid intelligence itself is sometimes called "the strength of focus".
> 2. You had better not rehearse the last position/sound . It will eventually decrease your performance! I mean the rehearsal "step by step": it will slow you down and distract. The only rehearsal allowed should be nearly unconscious and "effortless" (you will soon realize its meaning :)
> 3. Both points 1 & 2 thus imply that you must be focused on the most current stimulus as strongly as you can. Nevertheless, you cannot forget about the previous stimuli. How to do that? You should hold the image of them (image, picture, drawing, whatever you like) in your mind. Notice that you still do not rehearse anything that way.
> 4. Consider dividing the stream of data (n) on smaller parts. 6-back will be then two 3-back, for instance.
> 5. Follow square with your eyes as it changes its position.
> 6. Just turn on the Jaeggi mode with all the options to ensure your task is closest to the original version.
> 7. Consider doing more than 20 trials. I am on my way to do no less than 30 today. It may also help.
> 8. You may lower the difficulty by reducing the fall-back and advance levels from >75 and =<90 to 70 and 85 respectively (for instance).'

## Does it really work?

### N-back improves working memory
<!-- TODO: add more studies -->

There are quite a few studies showing significant increases in working memory. WM is something that can be trained. See for example ["Changes in cortical activity after training of working memory - a single-subject analysis."](http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:17597168) or ["Increased prefrontal and parietal activity after training of working memory"](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n1/abs/nn1165.html).

### IQ Tests
#### Measuring

Because N-back is supposed to improve your pure '[fluid intelligence](!Wikipedia)' (_Gf_), and not, say, your English vocabulary, the most accurate tests for seeing whether N-back has done anything are going to be ones that avoid vocabulary or literature or tests of subject-area knowledge. That is, 'culture-neutral' IQ tests. (A non-neutral test focuses more on your 'crystallized intelligence', while N-back is supposed to affect 'fluid intelligence'; they do affect each other a little but it's better to test fluid intelligence with a fluid intelligence test.)

As one ML member writes:

> "The WAIS test involves crystallized intelligence and is unsuitable for judging fluid intelligence. High working memory will not spawn the ability to solve complex mathematical and verbal problems on its own, you have to put your extended capacity to learning. All very-high-level IQ tests are largely crystallized IQ tests, therefore working memory gains will not be immediately apparent by their measure."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904)

#### Available tests

The gold-standard of culture-neutral IQ tests is [Raven's progressive matrices](!Wikipedia). Unfortunately, Raven's is not available for free online, but there are a number of clones one can use - bearing in mind their likely inaccuracy, and remembering that if you are testing at the beginning and end of your training there is probably going to be a [practice effect](!Wikipedia); it's strongly recommended you take tests only once, or at least with intervals on the order of months. The tests are:

- [iqout.com](http://www.iqout.com/)

- [High IQ Society Online Test](http://www.highiqsociety.org/iq_tests/) (includes eCMA)
<!-- http://www.iqtest.com/index.html seems to be heavily verbal & dependent on crystallized intelligence -->

If Raven-style tests bore you or you've gone through the previous ones, there are a wealth of difficult tests at Miyaguchi's ["Uncommonly Difficult IQ Tests"](http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/), and a [five-factor](!Wikipedia "Big Five personality traits") personality test, the [IPIP-NEO](http://www.personalitytest.net/ipip/ipipneo1.htm), is free (although the connection to IQ or _Gf_ or working memory is probably minimal).

Other tests that might be useful include [digit-span](!Wikipedia) tests: they provide a non-dual-N-back method of measuring WM before one begins training and then after. An example Flash digit-span test: <http://www.dushkin.com/connectext/psy/ch07/digitspan.mhtml>.

#### IQ test results

Reports of IQ tests have been mixed. Some results have been stunning, others have shown nothing.

##### Improvement

From what I remember, he had recently failed to qualify for MENSA, which requires a score of about 131 (98th percentile). He then got a 151 (99.97th percentile) on a professionally administered IQ test (WAIS) three months later, after 2 months of regular dual-n-back use." --[MR](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904)

(A >20 point gain sounds very impressive. But possible confounding factors here are that LSaul apparently took 2 different IQ tests; besides the general incomparability of different IQ tests, it sounds as if the first test was a culture-neutral one, while the WAIS has components such as verbal tests - the second might well be 'easier' for LSaul than the first.)

> "Empirically speaking, however: I took a WAIS-IV IQ test (administered professionally) around a year ago and got a 110. I took a derivative of the same test recently (mind you, after about 20 days of DNB training) and got a score of 121."

The blogger of ["Inhuman Experiment"](http://inhumanexperiment.blogspot.com/), who played for ~22 days and went from ~2.6-back to ~4-back, [reports](http://inhumanexperiment.blogspot.com/2009/03/increasing-intelligence-by-playing.html):

In this one, the questions vary, the difficulty is adjusted on the go depending on whether you answer them correctly, and there's a time limit of 45 seconds per question, which makes this test better suited for re-taking. My first test, taken before playing the game, gave me a score of 126; my second test, taken yesterday, gave me a score of 132 (an increase of about 5%)....As you can see, it's kind of difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this. Yes, there was a slight increase in my score, but I would say a similar increase could've been possible even without playing the game. I think the variation in the IQ test questions reduces the "learning by heart" effect, but that's impossible to say without a control group."

The highest score this test allows for is 171, meaning you got ZERO questions wrong. I got 6 wrong and 3 half questions wrong where it requires two answers (that was my worst section), so either 7.5 or 9 out of 33 questions wrong."

Toto writes in ["TNB(PIA) may improve intelligence"](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/255ce47293132240/7da5497fb1691528):

> "While DNB proved ineffective for me (at least it didn't increase my IQ, though it improved memory) TNB may have made a difference. I took 2 high-range tests during the last 2 months and the results were higher than I expected - my IQ was somewhere between 130 and 135 on good online tests, I scored 132 on a supervised test (Raven's SM). My results on CFNSE <http://www.etienne.se/cfnse/> and GET-γ <http://www.epiqsociety.org/get/>  were approximately 10 points higher - 6 on CFNSE (8 on my second attempt) and 21 on G.E.T) . It could be because of a flaw of these tests, or they may not test the same ability as timed tests (though the correlation between them and famous supervised timed tests is said to be very high), it may be for some other reason as well, but it could be because of TNB. I had tried CFNSE long ago and scored 0 (but I probably didn't try hard enough then)."

[argumzio](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4482aa213c8cbdf4/d1456393d7083660) reports a small increase, and offers wise words of advice to those pondering the IQ leaves:

> "In mid-March of this year, I took that High IQ society test eCMA (which is extremely reliable) and obtained a score of 143. I took it again 6 months later and scored 149, after my more intensive QNB training program that didn't last as long as I expected (I've forced myself to quit early).\
> Now, whether or not this can be attributed to gains in WM, Gc, Gf (I'm only 22, and they say Gf increases for a while around this time), dietary uptake and regularity, better sleeping habits, or general all-round trying harder, I cannot say. In any case, it is thoroughly possible that something led to that +6 pts, but it may merely indicate that my "true IQ" lies somewhere around the two scores or it may be even higher (for one cannot outperform one's "true IQ"). It is simply the case that one cannot take a mere number so seriously. It simply tells you in some limited sense where you are relative to a population of people."

[christopher lines](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/624d88b9d2f11860) reports:

> "I did a couple of the online IQ tests after about 10 days (scored 126 in one of them [iqtest.dk] and 106 [iqout.com] in another; I repeated the same tests about a month later (about 1 month ago) and scored (133 and 109). I have no idea why the tests gave such big differences in scores but I definately think its easier the second time you do the tests because I remembered the strategies for solving the problems which took some time to figure out when I first did the tests. I am kind of against keep re-doing the tests because of learning effects and a bit truobled [sic] that different test produce such different results."

Tofu [writes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/d1e53e8c69c95c3a):

> "I've purposely not been doing anything to practice for the tests or anything else I thought could increase my score so I wouldn't have to factor other things into an improvement in iq, which makes improvements more likely attributable to dual n-back.  Before I took the test I scored at 117, a score about 1 in about 8 people can get (7.78 to be exact), and yesterday I scored at 127 (a score that 1 in 28 people would get).  Its a pretty big difference I would say."

After a year of N-backing, Tofu has [3 sets of IQ test results](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3af97e7c14585851) using _Self-Scoring IQ Tests_ ([Victor Serebriakoff](!Wikipedia)). To summarize:

1. 0 months (D3B; ~71%): 27,25 = 117 IQ
2. 3 (T4B; ~76%): 37,40[^division] = 128
3. 12 (Q6B; ~47%): 34,42 = 128

Other relevant tests for Tofu:

> "As a sidenote- after 6 months I took a practice [LSAT](!Wikipedia) without any studying and got a 146, roughly 30th percentile, and I took an IQ test from http://iqtest.dk/main.swf after 1 year which I scored a 115 on. Also, in high school I took a professionally administered IQ test and got a 137 which may have been high because they took my age into account in the scoring like the old school IQ tests used to do, but I'm not sure if they actually did that."

##### No improvement

Some have not:

> "I took the Online Denmark IQ test again [after N-back training] and I got 140 (the same result)\
> I took a standardized (and charged) online IQ test from www.iqtest.com and I got 134 (though it may be a bit higher because English is not my mother tongue)" --[Crypto](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8af44f3b20df9904/c397c36355355d4c)

jttoto [reports](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/448c86efa0b645d1) a null result:

> "6 months ago I posted my IQ on this site after taking the Mensa Norway
test... [see IQ tests section]\
> I scored a 135.  After 6 months of dual n-back, triple n-back, and quad n-back training, I took the same exact test.  I scored exactly the same, 135.\
> Granted, I took 7 less minutes to complete the test, but this was due to familiarity of some of the questions.\
> That being said, I have been seeing significant increases in my digit span and other WM gains, so while my aptitude on questions like the Raven's may not have increased, my memory has."

(It's worth noting that Jttoto's experience doesn't rule out an IQ increase of some sort, as the original 135 score was from an IQ test he took after at least 10 hours of n-backing over 5 days, according to an [earlier email](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/448c86efa0b645d1); what it shows is that Jttoto didn't benefit or the benefits happened early on, or there's some other confounding factor. Test results can be very difficult to interpret.)

Keep in mind, that if IQ is improved, that doesn't necessarily mean anything unless one employs it to some end. It would be a shame to boost one's IQ through N-back, but never use it because one was too busy playing!

### Benefits

[Jack Nguyen asked](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/14c843162167c376) what benefits people saw from N-back use. The responses (and quotes from other threads) are, of course, entirely anecdotal, so take them as you will.

- Ashirgo: "To be honest, I do not feel any obvious difference. There are moments in which I perceive a significant improvement, though, as well as particulars task which are much easier now."\
    "I have also experienced better dream recalling, with all these reveries and other hallucinations included ;) I am more happier now than ever. I did doubt it would be ever possible! I am also more prone to get excited...Now people in my motherland are just boring to listen to. They speak too slow and seem as though it took them pains to express anything. I did not notice that after I had done my first ninety days of n-back, but now (after 2.5 months) it is just conspicuous."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)\
     "My change of opinion^[from at 90 days seeing little effect, to 2.5 months later producing the second testament] can be easily attributed to the improvement of mood, in coincidence with the mere fact that the winter days have passed and now there is a bright and sunny Spring in my country:)"; when asked if the previous means Ashirgo attributes all the improvement to the weather, Ashirgo [replied](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8f3f840e05a90509): "Fortunately, I can attribute many changes to n-back, I can now handle various tasks with little effort and it takes me much less time in comparison with others (especially when I know what to do:) ). Nevertheless, the main problem for me is that I am also occupied with few things that I suppose to be able to test my newly acquired potential, therefore I cannot say that "changes" are explicit everywhere.\
    On the other hand, I am starting to believe that any improvements (that one can expect) so smoothly and swiftly become a natural part of one's capabilities that it makes them hardly noticeable until some tests/measures are taken."
- chinmi04: "For me, it definitely has taught me how to focus. But I'm still not sure whether that has something to do with merely coming to realize the importance of focusing, or whether the program has really physically rewired my brain to focus better. In any case, it appears that I'm now faster at mental reasoning, creative thinking and speaking fluency. But again, the effects are not so clear as to completely eliminate any doubt regarding the connection with the n-back program."\
    "I have been maintaining a personal blog on wordpress since 3 years ago. Average post per month : a little over 1. Then I started with dual-n-back at the end of november... number of posts in January : 7! (none are about n-back)"
- Confuzedd: "[asked if felt 'sharper']: Nothing."
- ArseneLupin: "Not much, yet, but I feel that I can easier get a hold of a discussion. The feeling is the same as when I am mastering a certain n-back in the game (a bit hard to explain)."
- John: "I feel much sharper since I started in the middle of last November...My productivity is much higher these days. I'm a non-fiction writer, so having a higher working memory and fluid intelligence directly leads to better (and faster) performance. It's amazing to see the stuff I produce today and compare it to before I began the Dual N-Back training. Also, I am simultaneously learning German, French and Spanish, and I'm certain this is helping me learn those languages faster."
- Ginkgo: "DN-Back has probably helped me with one of my hobbies."
- BamaDoc: "I note a subjective difference in recall.  There might be some increase in attention, but I certainly do notice a difference in recall.  It might be placebo, but I am convinced enough that I continue to find time to use the program."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/f11ff07eb9eba1a4)
- karnautrahl: "Since November however, I began to read the Neuroscience book in more detail. I mentioned late December I think that I was finding I could understand more stuff. I've spent about £1000 on books since November. The large majority are books on the brain, source from Amazon reviews, reading lists and out of my own pirate list when I liked a book. I stopped Dual n Back in December, early. The benefits have stayed however. I tested this the other day, very easily going to 3 n back, which was mostly where I was before. I guess in a way I'm trying to say that for me, whilst the focus may have been on G increase and IQ etc, now the focus is on--what's *really* happened and what can I do with it :). What I can do with it is choose to concentrate long enough to genuinely understand fairly technical in depth chapters on subjects often new to me."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c)\
   "After not using this since around December last year, I still attribute my vastly improved concentration to DNB training...Some are degree textbooks or for med school students. I'm having no real trouble working through any of these....This isn't a case of how smart I became because I definitely have no comparison for this as I'm not on a course nor am I eligible for any degree placements at this time. What it is though, is my own personal testimony as to how much greater concentration I have than I ever had."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/a9e8c326d95f0da6) Karnautrahl writes more on his self-improvements in his thread ["Second lot of training started-and long term experience overall."](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/9c233ef7c68b16dc), and [describes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/aa849686781add83) an incident in which though he stopped using DNB 3 months previously, he still dealt with a technical issue much faster and more effectively than he feels he would've before.
- negatron: "One perhaps coincidental thing I noticed is that dream recollection went up substantially. A good while after I stopped I developed an odd curiosity for what I previously considered unpleasant material, such as advanced mathematics. Never imagined I'd consider the thought of advanced calculus exciting. I began reading up on such subjects far more frequently than I used to. This was well after I've long forgotten about dual n-back so I find it hard to attribute it to a placebo effect, believing that I'm more adapted to this material. On the other hand I don't recall reading anything about motivational benefits to dual n-back training so I still consider this conjecture and perhaps an eventful coincidence just the same."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c)
- Chris: "One thing I have noticed is the recollection of a number of very unpleasant images in dreams. Specifically, images of bodily disease, mutilation, injury and post-mortem decomposition. I find it difficult to believe it's just a coincidence, because I can't remember when I last had such a dream, and I've had maybe half a dozen since I started dual n-back. But perhaps it's simply owing to better recall."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/7a674cf0305a6f5c)
- sutur: "i didn't really notice any concrete changes in my thinking process, which probably, if existent, are rather hard to detect reliably anyway. one thing i did notice however is an increased sense of calmness. i used to move my legs around an awful lot while sitting which i now don't feel the urge to anymore. but of course this could be placebo or something else entirely. i also seem to be able to read text (in books or on screen) more fluently now with less danger of distraction. however, personally i am quite skeptic when people describe the changes they notice. changes in cognitive capacity are probably quite subtle, build up slowly and are hard to notice through introspection."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)
- astriaos: "By 'robust', I mean practically everything I do is qualitatively different from how I did things 30 days previous to the dual n-back training. For instance, in physics class I went from vaguely understanding most of the concepts covered in class to a mastery thorough enough that now my questions usually transcend the scope of the in-class and textbook material, routinely stupefying my physics teacher into longer-than-average pauses. It's the same experience for all of my classes. Somehow, I've learned more-than-I usually learn of physics/government/ etc. (all of my classes, and any topic in general) information from sources outside of class, and without what I consider significant effort. I feel like my learning speed has gone up by some factor greater than 1; I can follow longer arguments with greater precision; my vocabulary has improved; I can pay attention longer; my problem solving skills are significantly better... Really, it's amazing how much cognition depends on attention!"[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1c44c7570cdb4a35)

- [Pheonexia](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/8f3f840e05a90509): "now I'm at 6-back and am consistently between 50 and 80% accurate....All that said, I have NOT noticed any differences in my mental capacity, intelligence, daily life, or even ability to remember things that just happened. I still sometimes forget people's names right after they tell me them. I'm going to keep training though, because just because I haven't consciously noticed these things, I have faith in scientific studies, so with enough training hopefully I'll yield some positive benefits."
- [Pontus Granström](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/7ec15b99a2a1a2f0) "I certainly feel calmer happier and more motivated after doing DNB, it has to do with the increase of dopamine receptors no doubt!"
-[Chris Warren](N-back FAQ#Hardcore) summarizes the results of his intensive practice (covered above): "For those that are curious, I noticed the largest change in my thought processes on Wednesday. My abilities were noticeably different, to the extent that, at some points, it was, well, startling. I've started getting used to the feeling, so I can't really compare my intelligence now vs. Wednesday. However, I'm completely confident that I've become smarter. Under the kind of stress I've put my brain through, I can't imagine a scenario where that _wouldn't_ happen."\
    "After the first couple days of training, I experienced a very rapid increase in intelligence. It suddenly became easier to think. I can't give you any hard evidence, since I didn't bother to take any tests before I started. However, I can give you this: when I woke up Wednesday morning, I felt the same as I did after the first time I tried n-back. Except the feeling was 10 times stronger, and my thinking was noticeably faster and more comprehensive."
- [Raman](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/7ec15b99a2a1a2f0) reports an initial null result: "19 days with n-back are over... no subjective benefits as such. But I am aware at what point I am comfortable or not. e.g. y'day playing the game was effortless, and today my brain felt sort of sticky, the sequence was just not sticking in my brain. very strange what a few hours can do."
- [iwan tulijef](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5e7ac7e6432b0d77/9f3b791ee0fb1c38) says that "Long time ago I was diagnosed Adhd [sic] and for long time I took meds and this training helped me to reduce my meds nearly to zero, compared with the doses I took before. Unfortunately this haven't fixed the whole thing. But what I noticed was, hmm... those things are very difficult to describe.... that time by time I got more control about my mental life. Obvious effects in social matters were e.g. that I could follow conversations better and behave more naturally. In my education matters, e.g. that I understood maths proofs better. There are a lot of details. Interesting was, as these issues are, to understate it a bit, not unimportant for me, that in the beginning when I remarked changes, I got a bit euphoric, so the first effects of n-back feeled like the strongest." and warns us that "It's very difficult and very questionable to take objective informations out of subjective self evaluation."

- [jttoto](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/448c86efa0b645d1) saw no gain on an IQ test, but thinks he's benefited anyway: "My friends have always called me inattentive and absent-minded, but since playing n-back no one has called me that for a while. I now never forget where I park my car, when I used to do that nearly every other day. I feel more attentive. Even if my ability to solve problems hasn't improved, the gains in my memory are real and measurable."
-[reece](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4a0b81bb5f72647f): "Not that I've noticed [an improvement in [lateral thinking](!Wikipedia)].

Working memory has improved, however other things I've always struggled with such as uncued long term memory recall have not....\
   I'm still very absent-minded and believe n-back has made me more easily distractable (lowered latent inhibition?), although to be fair, I may have brought this on myself by playing quad n-back and this was not something I noticed when only playing dual n-back. I seem to be able to get by on about one hour less sleep per night and perform better cognitively when sleep deprived. Dream recall has increased significantly as has lucid dreaming. I do take a few nootropics, however I've been taking the same ones for years...Verbal fluency appears to have improved, proper spelling and punctuation are things I've always struggled with and do not appear to have ameliorated resultant from n-back training."[](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3008683d4b314f6/5e833c4c0df9fb9b)

After DNB, I am more inclined to study and complete long pending items. However, there is a confounding variable. I don't usually do DNB when in an unhealthy state of mind (for example, with little sleep and extremely high stress). Still, I believe that I can attribute some of the effects only to DNB.\

Perhaps I'll give it another go over break and report back. My goal originally was to get to P5B before adding a second sound stimulus making a Sextuple Nback but I don't know if Shamanu made an updated version to make that any easier. I'm also kind of on the fence about the effect on the depth of training. It may have been more beneficial to do higher N levels instead of more stimuli."
- [Tofu](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3af97e7c14585851), after a year of n-backing:

> "N-back training may have somehow improved my verbal intelligence, but since verbal intelligence is a form of crystallized intelligence and training working memory is supposed to primarily improve fluid intelligence, it probably didn't. My score on the verbal subtest went up and then down which would make no sense if it did have any influence...Since my IQ score increased from the first test to the second test, and stayed the same from the second test to the third test it could be possibly that working memory only contributes to IQ up to a certain point.  All in all, I feel more inclined to say that n-back training has only a little if any effect on IQ though which is why reason I'm probably going to stop doing the n-back training.\
> On a more positive note, since I started n-back training I have noticed better concentration which I had a serious problem with before.  In general, I feel like I think more clearly and I at least feel like I've become smarter too.  I've reached a pretty high level in n-back and any gains I've made in the last month or two have been small, so I think I've reached a long-term plateau which is another reason for me to stop the training.  From my experience when I stop the n-back training for a month or two and return to n-back training I still perform at the same level anyway.  It seems like the effects from training are going to last a while which is also good news. Overall, I feel like the n-back training was worth it but if I had it to do over I would have probably stopped after a couple of months."

### Creativity

One of the worries occasionally cited is that DNB training mostly serves to increase one's focus on the task one is thinking about. Which is great in most contexts but, the fear goes, the ability to focus on one thing is the ability to exclude ('inhibit') thoughts on all other topics - which is crucial to creativity. Reports on mixed on this. One negative report is from [john21012101](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/f1eefb13c1658b24/e2490a2f19cb4abb):

> "I've done the dual n-back task avidly for over a month and while I find it makes me mentally sharper, that comes a high cost - the loss of creativity and lateral thinking.  In fact, I experience what is called as severe directed attention fatigue (see <www.troutfoot.com/attn/dafintro.html>).\
> ...and even short booster sessions severely impair creativity to the point that one becomes very mentally flat, single-minded, and I'd even say zombie-ish."

Ashirgo, chinmi04, & putomayo begged to differ, with biped plumping for a null result.

There are some theoretical reasons to believe DNB isn't causing gains at the expense of creativity, as there is that Jaeggi study showing Gf gains, and Gf is mildly correlated with creativity, according to [exigentsky](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/f1eefb13c1658b24/8c267394bb1081cc):

> "Furthermore, if the preliminary results hold and dual-n-back actually increased Gf, it should actually contribute to creativity for most people. After all, studies have shown that creativity (according to standard tests) and IQ are significantly correlated to a certain point (~120 on most). While both tests are imperfect and incomplete, they do give a general picture.\
> I have not felt a decrease in my creativity and am skeptical of the idea that dual-n-back harms it. If the purported mechanism is increasing [latent inhibition](!Wikipedia), that would be an even bigger breakthrough than increasing IQ. The former is still largely considered immutable."

[Vlad](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1b0b307f9605ba4e/47d0a2fcc41ae4d3) has some more details on those correlations:

> "Last but not least, there was this research "Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students", which I studied because of this today, and they found *positive* correlation IQ vs verbal and figural creative processes (fluency, flexibility, object designing, specific traits, insight...). And this mild correlation (of 0.3 - 0.5), did not differ for different IQ levels (higher IQs had mild higher creativity, lower IQs had mild lower creativity - always mild relationship, so exceptions too, but in general more IQ meant more creativity)."

On the other hand, Vlad [also points out](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/1b0b307f9605ba4e?hl=en) that:

> "...there are few theories how WM works, and one of the most explaining is, that WM and attention are tied closely together (Ash always emphasizes this and he is right :). This should work through the fact, that higher WM means more sources for inhibition of distraction. So, the more WM, the better you can concentrate. They tested this with coctail party effect: in general, only 33% of persons catch their name from irrelevant background noise, while concentrating on some task. Now they found, that only 20% of high WM people catched their name, but 65% of low WM. On the other side, contemporary researches sometimes differ between WM, STM, primary / secondary WM, even LTM... But the point is, attention works at least partly as a filter, and it gets better with higher WM.\
> Now the issue with creativity. I find this interesting, because I think somebody here worried already about being subjectively less creative than before BW training, and I got this feeling few times too.\

As well, Pheonexia points out that [McNab 2008](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/McNab2008.pdf) & McNab 2009 demonstrated increases in various things related to [dopamine](!Wikipedia) because of DNB, and that there is one study that ["Dopamine agonists disrupt visual latent inhibition in normal males using a within-subject paradigm"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12610717).

# What's some relevant research?

The main Jaeggi studies (2003, and 2008) are available in the Group's [Files](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/files) folder, as is the McNab 2009 study showing physical changes to dopamine neurochemistry after N-back training. All of the studies in that folder was well worth reading for background information.

- ["Training and transfer effects of executive functions in preschool
children"](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/Thorell2008.pdf):

> "Executive functions, including working memory and inhibition, are of central importance to much of human behavior. Interventions intended to improve executive functions might therefore serve an important purpose. Previous studies show that working memory can be improved by training, but it is unknown if this also holds for inhibition, and whether it is possible to train executive functions in preschoolers. In the present study, preschool children received computerized training of either visuo-spatial working memory or inhibition for 5 weeks. An active control group played commercially available computer games, and a passive control group took part in only pre- and posttesting. Children trained on working memory improved significantly on trained tasks; they showed training effects on non-trained tests of spatial and verbal working memory, as well as transfer effects to attention. Children trained on inhibition showed a significant improvement over time on two out of three trained task paradigms, but no significant improvements relative to the control groups on tasks measuring working memory or attention. In neither of the two interventions were there effects on non-trained inhibitory tasks. The results suggest that working memory training can have significant effects also among preschool children. The finding that inhibition could not be improved by either one of the two training programs might be due to the particular training program used in the present study or possibly indicate that executive functions differ in how easily they can be improved by training, which in turn might relate to differences in their underlying psychological and neural processes."

- ["Common and unique components of inhibition and working memory: An fMRI, within-subjects investigation"](http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/McNab2008.pdf)

> "Behavioural findings indicate that the core executive functions of inhibition and working memory are closely linked, and neuroimaging studies indicate overlap between their neural correlates. There has not, however, been a comprehensive study, including several inhibition tasks and several working memory tasks, performed by the same subjects. In the present study, 11 healthy adult subjects completed separate blocks of 3 inhibition tasks (a stop task, a go/no-go task and a flanker task), and 2 working memory tasks (one spatial and one verbal). Activation common to all 5 tasks was identified in the right inferior frontal gyrus, and, at a lower threshold, also the right middle frontal gyrus and right parietal regions (BA 40 and BA 7). Left inferior frontal regions of interest (ROIs) showed a significant conjunction between all tasks except the flanker task. The present study could not pinpoint the specific function of each common region, but the parietal region identified here has previously been consistently related to working memory storage and the right inferior frontal gyrus has been associated with inhibition in both lesion and imaging studies. These results support the notion that inhibitory and working memory tasks involve common neural components, which may provide a neural basis for the interrelationship between the two systems."

> "Recent functional neuroimaging evidence suggests a bottleneck between learning new information and remembering old information. In two behavioral experiments and one functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, we tested the hypothesis that learning and remembering compete when both processes happen within a brief period of time. In the first behavioral experiment, participants intentionally remembered old words displayed in the foreground, while incidentally learning new scenes displayed in the background. In line with a memory competition, we found that remembering old information was associated with impaired learning of new information. We replicated this finding in a subsequent fMRI experiment, which showed that this behavioral effect was coupled with a suppression of learning-related activity in visual and medial temporal areas. Moreover, the fMRI experiment provided evidence that left mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in resolving the memory competition, possibly by facilitating rapid switching between learning and remembering. Critically, a follow-up behavioral experiment in which the background scenes were replaced with a visual target detection task provided indications that the competition between learning and remembering was not merely due to attention. This study not only provides novel insight into our capacity to learn and remember, but also clarifies the neural mechanisms underlying flexible behavior."

["Gaining control: training executive function and far transfer of the ability to resolve interference"](http://www2.psychology.su.se/staff/jpn/papers/PerssonJ_PsychologicalScience_2008.pdf). Persson J, Reuter-Lorenz PA:

> "Functional brain-imaging data document overlapping sites of activation in prefrontal cortex across memory tasks, suggesting that these tasks may share common executive components. We leveraged this evidence to develop a training regimen and a set of transfer tasks to examine the trainability of a putative executive-control process: interference resolution. Eight days of training on high-interference versions of three different working memory tasks increased the efficiency with which proactive interference was resolved on those particular tasks. Moreover, an improved ability to resolve interference was also transferred to different working memory, semantic memory, and episodic memory tasks, a demonstration of far-transfer effects from process-specific training. Participants trained with noninterference versions of the tasks did not exhibit transfer. We infer that the transfer we demonstrated resulted from increased efficiency of the interference-resolution process. Therefore, this aspect of executive control is plastic and adaptive, and can be improved by training."

> "On the basis of the executive-attention theory of working memory capacity (WMC; e.g., M. J. Kane, A. R. A. Conway, D. Z. Hambrick, & R. W. Engle, 2007), the authors tested the relations among WMC, mind wandering, and goal neglect in a sustained attention to response task (SART; a go/no-go task). In 3 SART versions, making conceptual versus perceptual processing demands, subjects periodically indicated their thought content when probed following rare no-go targets. SART processing demands did not affect mind-wandering rates, but mind-wandering rates varied with WMC and predicted goal-neglect errors in the task; furthermore, mind-wandering rates partially mediated the WMC-SART relation, indicating that WMC-related differences in goal neglect were due, in part, to variation in the control of conscious thought."

     > "Several recent latent variable analyses suggest that (working memory capacity) accounts for at least one-third and perhaps as much as one-half of the variance in (intelligence).What seems to be important about WM span tasks is that they require the active maintenance of information in the face of concurrent processing and interference and therefore recruit an executive attention-control mechanism to combat interference. Furthermore, this ability seems to be mediated by portions of the prefrontal cortex."

The relation of caffeine to learning & memory is complicated; for now, see [the thread on it](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/74991713608a29a5).

## Saccading

 One fascinating psychology result is that strongly [right-handed](!Wikipedia "Right-handedness") people can improve their memory (and possibly N-back performance) by simply taking 30 seconds and flicking ("[saccading](!Wikipedia "saccade")") their eyes left and right (for a summary, see ["A quick eye-exercise can improve your performance on memory tests (but only if you're right-handed)"](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/04/a_quick_eye-exercise_can_impro.php).

Version 4.5 of Brain Workshop includes a saccading feature: a dot alternates sides of the screen and one is to follow it with one's eyes. (You activate it by pressing 'e'. It's not a bad idea to alternate rounds of N-back with rounds of saccading.)

Ashirgo [writes](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3e9b194bd55401d6) that her previous advice encompasses this eye-movement result; Pheonexia reports that after trying the saccading before a BW session, he 'performed better than I ever have before'.

The most recent study on this effect seems to be ["Eye movements enhance memory for individuals who are strongly right-handed and harm it for individuals who are not"](http://louisville.edu/psychology/lyle/LyleLogan-RoedigerPB-R2008.pdf). It says:

> "Subjects who make repetitive saccadic eye movements before a memory test subsequently exhibit superior retrieval in comparison with subjects who do not move their eyes. It has been proposed that eye movements enhance retrieval by increasing interaction of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. To test this, we compared the effect of eye movements on subsequent recall (Experiment1) and recognition (Experiment2) in two groups thought to differ in baseline degree of hemispheric interaction—individuals who are strongly right-handed (SR) and individuals who are not (nSR). For SR subjects, who naturally may experience less hemispheric interaction than nSR subjects, eye movements enhanced retrieval. In contrast, depending on the measure, eye movements were either inconsequential or even detrimental for nSR subjects. These results partially support the hemispheric interaction account, but demand an amendment to explain the harmful effects of eye movements for nSR individuals."

(Note that very important caveat: this is a useful technique *only* for strongly right-handed people; weak righties and lefties are outright harmed by this technique.)

## Sleep
["Sleep Accelerates the Improvement in Working Memory Performance"](docs/kuriyama2008-sleep-improves-nback.pdf)[](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/40/10145) ([PDF](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/10145.pdf), Kuiryama, _The Journal of Neuroscience_, October 1, 2008 • 28(40):10145–10150:

> "Working memory (WM) performance, which is an important factor for determining problem-solving and reasoning ability, has been firmly believed to be constant. However, recent findings have demonstrated that WM performance has the potential to be improved by repetitive training. Although various skills are reported to be improved by sleep, the beneficial effect of sleep on WM performance has not been clarified. Here, we show that improvement in WM performance is facilitated by posttraining naturalistic sleep. A spatial variant of the _n_-back WM task was performed by 29 healthy young adults who were assigned randomly to three different experimental groups that had different time schedules of repetitive _n_-back WM task sessions, with or without intervening sleep. Intergroup and intersession comparisons of WM performance (accuracy and response time) profiles showed that n-back accuracy after posttraining sleep was significantly improved compared with that after the same period of wakefulness, independent of sleep timing, subject’s vigilance level, or circadian influences. On the other hand, response time was not influenced by sleep or repetitive training schedules. The present study indicates that improvement in _n_-back accuracy, which could reflect WM capacity, essentially benefits from posttraining sleep."

(In this test, the baseline/unpracticed performance of the two groups was the same; but the schedule in which subjects trained at 10 PM and went to bed resulted in greater improvements in performance than schedules in which subjects trained when they got up at 8 AM and went to bed ~10 PM.)

## Criticism of Jaeggi 2008

### Moody 2009

Jaeggi 2008, you may remember, showed that training on N-back improved working memory, but it also boosted scores on tests of _Gf_. The latter would be a major result - indeed, unique - and is one of the main research results encouraging people to do N-back in a non-research setting. People _want_ to believe that N-back is efficacious and particularly that it will do more than boost working memory. So we need to be wary of [confirmation bias](!Wikipedia) (for those of you who read too much fantasy, you'll know this as the [Wizard's First Rule](!Wikipedia)).

Fortunately, we can [discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/5c7247e00fe9bca9) at length the work of one David E. Moody who has [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2009.04.005) a criticism of how the odd methodology of Jaeggi 2008 undermines this result. He's worth quoting at length, since besides being important to understanding Jaeggi's study, it's an interesting example of how subtle issues can be important in psychology:

> "The subjects were divided into four groups, differing in the number of days of training they received on the task of working memory. The group that received the least training (8 days) was tested on Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1990), a widely used and well-established test of fluid intelligence. This group, however, demonstrated negligible improvement between pre- and post-test performance.\
> The other three groups were not tested using Raven's Matrices, but rather on an alternative test of much more recent origin. The Bochumer Matrices Test (BOMAT) (Hossiep, Turck, & Hasella, 1999) is similar to Raven's in that it consists of visual analogies. In both tests, a series of geometric and other figures is presented in a matrix format and the subject is required to infer a pattern in order to predict the next figure in the series. The authors provide no reason for switching from Raven's to the BOMAT.\
> The BOMAT differs from Raven's in some important respects, but is similar in one crucial attribute: both tests are progressive in nature, which means that test items are sequentially arranged in order of increasing difficulty. A high score on the test, therefore, is predicated on subjects' ability to solve the more difficult items.\
> However, this progressive feature of the test was effectively eliminated by the manner in which Jaeggi et al. administered it. The BOMAT is a 29-item test which subjects are supposed to be allowed 45 min to complete. Remarkably, however, Jaeggi et al. reduced the allotted time from 45 min to 10. The effect of this restriction was to make it impossible for subjects to proceed to the more difficult items on the test. The large majority of the subjects—regardless of the number of days of training they received—answered less than 14 test items correctly.\
> By virtue of the manner in which they administered the BOMAT, Jaeggi et al. transformed it from a test of fluid intelligence into a speed test of ability to solve the easier visual analogies.
> The time restriction not only made it impossible for subjects to proceed to the more difficult items, it also limited the opportunity to learn about the test—and so improve performance—in the process of taking it. This factor cannot be neglected because test performance does improve with practice, as demonstrated by the control groups in the Jaeggi study, whose improvement from pre- to post-test was about half that of the experimental groups. The same learning process that occurs from one administration of the test to the next may also operate within a given administration of the test—provided subjects are allowed sufficient time to complete it.\
> Since the whole weight of their conclusion rests upon the validity of their measure of fluid intelligence, one might assume the authors would present a careful defense of the manner in which they administered the BOMAT. Instead they do not even mention that subjects are normally allowed 45 min to complete the test. Nor do they mention that the test has 29 items, of which most of their subjects completed less than half.\
> The authors' entire rationale for reducing the allotted time to 10 min is confined to a footnote. That footnote reads as follows:\
>> Although this procedure differs from the standardized procedure, there is evidence that this timed procedure has little influence on relative standing in these tests, in that the correlation of speeded and non-speeded versions is very high (r = 0.95; ref. 37).\
> The reference given in the footnote is to a 1988 study (Frearson & Eysenck, 1986) that is not in fact designed to support the conclusion stated by Jaeggi et al. The 1988 study merely contains a footnote of its own, which refers in turn to unpublished research conducted forty years earlier. That research involved Raven's matrices, not the BOMAT, and entailed a reduction in time of at most 50%, not more than 75%, as in the Jaeggi study.\
> So instead of offering a reasoned defense of their procedure, Jaeggi et al. provide merely a footnote which refers in turn to a footnote in another study. The second footnote describes unpublished results, evidently recalled by memory over a span of 40 years, involving a different test and a much less severe reduction in time.\
> In this context it bears repeating that the group that was tested on Raven's matrices (with presumably the same time restriction) showed virtually no improvement in test performance, in spite of eight days' training on working memory. Performance gains only appeared for the groups administered the BOMAT. But the BOMAT differs in one important respect from Raven's. Raven's matrices are presented in a 3 × 3 format, whereas the BOMAT consists of a 5 × 3 matrix configuration.\
> With 15 visual figures to keep track of in each test item instead of 9, the BOMAT puts added emphasis on subjects' ability to hold details of the figures in working memory, especially under the condition of a severe time constraint. Therefore it is not surprising that extensive training on a task of working memory would facilitate performance on the early and easiest BOMAT test items—those that present less of a challenge to fluid intelligence.\
> This interpretation acquires added plausibility from the nature of one of the two working-memory tasks administered to the experimental groups. The authors maintain that those tasks were “entirely different” from the test of fluid intelligence. One of the tasks merits that description: it was a sequence of letters presented auditorily through headphones.\
> But the other working-memory task involved recall of the location of a small square in one of several positions in a visual matrix pattern. It represents in simplified form precisely the kind of detail required to solve visual analogies. Rather than being “entirely different” from the test items on the BOMAT, this task seems well-designed to facilitate performance on that test."

### Seidler 2010

["Cognitive Training As An Intervention To Improve Driving Ability In The Older Adult"](http://m-castl.org/files/2010-01SeidlerReport.pdf), a [technical report](!Wikipedia) by a group which includes Susanne Jaeggi, studied the effect of DNB on the driving ability of younger/older adults. As part of the before/after test battery, a Raven's was administered:

> "Type 2 tests included Raven’s matrices (Raven et al., 1990), which is a standardized test of fluid intelligence, and the BOMAT and verbal analogies tests of intelligence (Hossiep et al., 1995). We have previously shown that working memory training transfers to performance on this task (Jaeggi et al., 2008), and we included it here for the sake of replication."

They found the [null result](!Wikipedia):

> "There were no significant group by test session interactions for the intelligence measures or complex motor tasks for the young adults, although one of the intelligence measures exhibited a trend for transfer effects that scaled with training task gains.
>
> ...
>
> Unlike in our previous work (Jaeggi et al., 2008) we did not observe transfer to measures of intelligence. This may have been a by-product of the rather extensive pre and post test battery of assessments that we performed, particularly given that one of the intelligence measures was always performed last in the sequence of tests. Given this, participants may have been too fatigued and / or unmotivated to perform these tests well."

> "There are several studies showing that working memory and intelligence are strongly related. However, working memory tasks require simultaneous processing and storage, so the causes of their relationship with intelligence are currently a matter of discussion. The present study examined the simultaneous relationships among short-term memory (STM), working memory (WM), and general intelligence (_g_). Two hundred and eight participants performed six verbal, quantitative, and spatial STM tasks, six verbal, quantitative, and spatial WM tasks, and eight tests measuring fluid, crystallized, spatial, and quantitative intelligence. Especial care is taken to avoid misrepresenting the relations among the constructs being studied because of specific task variance. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results revealed that (a) WM and g are (almost) isomorphic constructs, (b) the isomorphism vanishes when the storage component of WM is partialed out, and (c) STM and WM (with its storage component partialed out) predict _g_."

- Colom et al. "General intelligence and memory span: Evidence for a common neuroanatomic framework"; _Cognitive Neuropsychology_, Volume 24, Issue 8 December 2007 , pages 867 - 878

> "General intelligence (_g_) is highly correlated with working-memory capacity (WMC). It has been argued that these central psychological constructs should share common neural systems. The present study examines this hypothesis using structural magnetic resonance imaging to determine any overlap in brain areas where regional grey matter volumes are correlated to measures of general intelligence and to memory span. In normal volunteers (N = 48) the results (p < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) indicate that a common anatomic framework for these constructs implicates mainly frontal grey matter regions belonging to Brodmann area (BA) 10 (right superior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus) and, to a lesser degree, the right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40). These findings support the nuclear role of a discrete parieto-frontal network. "

## Supplements ([nootropics](!Wikipedia))

### Piracetam

A useful pharmaceutical is [piracetam](!Wikipedia); [TheQ17](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/e9074921a905a7fa) mentions that "Personally, I have found piracetam be quite useful in helping me stay alert and focused during long study hours or doing redundant tasks." [Other members](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4482aa213c8cbdf4/d1456393d7083660) also swear by piracetam+choline.

The author of this FAQ [reports that](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/4f52e50ef2c0e64) piracetam and [choline](!Wikipedia) helped reduced mental fatigue and gave a small (~10%) increase in his D4B score.

### Huperzine

[Reece](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/3de2bf7a8e70949c) writes

> "I've tried [huperzine](!Wikipedia) [a chemical extracted from an herb] (actually been using it for about a year now) and it is quite effective for both lucid dreaming and increasing dream recall if taken shortly before bed, not to mention the other benefits you'd expect from a potent [acetylcholinesterase](!Wikipedia) inhibitor. I haven't had anything in the way of negative side effects when I've stuck to a 5 day/week dosage of 200mcg.\
> I've never tried piracetam, however [oxiracetam](!Wikipedia) felt like a placebo when compared to the benefits I've received from huperzine A. At larger doses, I've found huperzine A to be far more powerful than any nootropic I've ever tried (haven't tried any prescription meds such as [deprenyl](!Wikipedia)), however the side effects such as blurry vision and light-headedness weren't something I could tolerate."

He further compared their effects:

> 'I found Oxiracetam to have a somewhat "speedy" effect -- you would certainly know you
took something if someone slipped that in your drink! As for effects, Oxiracetam seemed to help most with verbal fluency (auditory working memory?) and creativity. Huperzine helped more with working memory although it didn't have some of the interesting effects Oxiracetam had on creativity, nor the speedy rush that sometimes seemed like a powerful motivator to get work done.'

(Reece did not take the oxiracetam with any choline supplements, which is usually recommended.)

### Miscellaneous
In the realm of unusual supplements to n-backing, we can include: ...

- [creatine](!Wikipedia); while creatine is famous for its athletic uses, it turns out to boost mental performance as well, and particularly performance while fatigued. There is a [thread](http://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/browse_thread/thread/fe4ee2f0c994e40e) discussing the research on creatine. The results are a little mixed, but Jonathan Toomim recommends it highly, claiming that "I'm more confident that I've noticed effects [on mental performance] of  creatine than of DnB."

[^spatial]: _Psychonomic Bulletin & Review_ 2008 Aug;15(4):763-71. "Training generalized spatial skills." Wright R, Thompson WL, Ganis G, Newcombe NS, Kosslyn SM.

     > "...The present study investigated whether intensive long-term practice leads to change that transcends stimulus and task parameters. Thirty-one participants (14 male, 17 female) were tested on three cognitive tasks: a computerized version of the Shepard-Metzler (1971) mental rotation task (MRT), a mental paper-folding task (MPFT), and a verbal analogies task (VAT). Each individual then participated in daily practice sessions with the MRT or the MPFT over 21 days. Postpractice comparisons revealed transfer of practice gains to novel stimuli for the practiced task, as well as transfer to the other, nonpracticed spatial task. Thus, practice effects were process based, not instance based. Improvement in the nonpracticed spatial task was greater than that in the VAT; thus, improvement was not merely due to greater ease with computerized testing."
