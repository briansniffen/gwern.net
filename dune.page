"Amazon.com: Did Frank Herbert leave any notes or an outline that you've used to write the prequels?

Herbert: Years after my father passed away we got a call from the attorney who handled his estate, saying that they'd found two safe-deposit keys. We were thinking maybe there were some jewels in there or something. But it turned out that there's nothing of value in thereâ€¦ but the notes for _Dune 7_. [laughs]

Anderson: Then Brian was cleaning out his garage to make an office space and he found all these boxes that had "Dune Notes" on the side. And we used a lot of them for our House books.

Herbert: Dad always called my mother a "white witch." Then, after Kevin and I met, I got the call about the safe-deposit boxes. Then I found the notes. I felt that my mom was making sure Kevin and I got along and was watching over me."
...
"Anderson: There was a lot of reaction. "How can you do this?" There was a fan group on the Internet that decided we shouldn't do this. There were 60 of them on Amazon and they put 60 one-star reviews up saying, "We don't even have to read them." I was the Dummy of Dune and Brian was the Anti-Christ."
...
"Amazon.com: Would Frank Herbert have enjoyed the prequels?

Herbert: It's not as good as Frank Herbert writing the story, but it's as good as anyone can do right now. We're not going to milk this. We're not going to carry on too far. We still feel the great passion, the great energy for the story."

## Skepticism

Look here:

"The Leto/Jessica meeting scene in HOUSE HARKONNEN was actually written by Frank Herbert himself and found in his notes. The events shown in HOUSE HARKONNEN are consistent with the original notes."


http://www.frankherbert.net/news/genesis.html

> Dune began with a concept whose mostly unfleshed images took shape across about six years of research and one and a half years of writing. The story was all in my head until it appeared on paper as I typed it out.

So no notes? On the other hand, arguably the prototypes and drafts for _Dune_, as seen in things like _The Road to Dune_ anthology, are 'notes'.

John... we've argued about this before: just because Herbert did not keep notes when he was developing the first novel, Dune, does not mean that he didn't keep notes for the later ones and after Ch:D.  He was getting on in years at that point, and perhaps in his collaborations he picked up the habit of keeping notes.

John- I never said that there might exist notes for the prequels- if FH had left notes, the core ideas and plot for them would have been a hell of a lot better than they are.  But i still think there is a good chance of notes for _Dune 7_, since that ending might not have satisfied Herbert.  Besides, _Dune 7_ would finish out a second trilogy, and trilogies usually require notes.

further evidence against notes is the many apparent inconsistencies. Why on earth are the sequels _Hunters of Dune_ and _Sandworms of Dune_? Dune  is toast!  Charred to dust! Not even ashes!  And our only familiar characters are uncounted universes away from what was Arrakis!  Stinks of crass commercialism to me.


You're assuming he did [intend Omnius in _Dune 7_]. Given that CH:D says that Daniel & Marty were super face dancers, but BH/KJA have instead made Daniel & Marty Omnius and Erasmus instead. This  seems, to me, to cast some doubt on whether or not Omnius and co. were ever part of FH's vision as it strikes me as a blatant & irreconcilable contradiction. If you drop your assumption, the answer is easy: the fanatical machine enemy is a hoary shopworn sci-fi cliche which comes naturally, in the same way rain comes from the sky. There's a koan I read once in _[The Fall of Hyperion](!Wikipedia)_:

    [Once Ummon asked
    a lesser light//
    Are you a gardener>//
    //Yes// it replied\\
    //Why have turnips no roots>\\
    Ummon asked the gardener\
    who could not reply\\
    //Because\\ said Ummon//
    rainwater is plentiful]


# The Golden Path

> "Is there some frontier?" Idaho asked. "Is there some frontier where I could go and never again be a part of this?"
> "If there is to be any frontier, you must help me create it," Leto said. "There is now no place to go where others of us cannot follow and find you."
> "Then you won't let me go."
> "Go if you wish. Others of you have tried it. I tell you there is no frontier, no place to hide. Right now, as it has been for a long, long time, humankind is like a single-celled creature, bound together by a dangerous glue."
> "No new planets? No strange.. ."
> "Oh, we grow, but we do not separate.""



> If Siona's vision was of the future, she wouldn't have been able to see
> the people, they're mostly descended from her and would be invisible
> from prescients.

Her vision was of *a* future, a future that would come to pass sooner
or later without the Golden Path. As she is part of the Golden Path,
then it makes sense that she wouldn't see herself or any of her
descendants in a non-Golden Path future.


# The Bene Gesserit's goals

The BG are known from interior monologues as cynical fashioners and manipulators of religion, who respect the power of religion, but are as far as I can tell actually atheistic.  Now, the problem is, if that is so, why do they follow the norms of the Butlerian Jihad, refusing to utilize sentient machines and notably Tleilaxu techniques like controlled mutation (their refusal is in DM), except at CH:D where circumstances forced Tleilaxu techniques on'em.
The BT are even more interesting.  They are absent in D, presented as even more effective BG in DM (notice how Scytale runs rings around everyone, and the excerpts from Tleilaxu works are even more cynical and manipulative than the BG, who at least do all their projects in the name of getting humanity to 'grow up'.). But come the later books, they suddenly appear to be militant fundamentals in the Shia tradition (for all Sunni is avowed).  Very strange.

Yeah, but *why*?  Both groups have no doubt long since noticed their taboos (I don't think the BG could function if they didn't realize what limits, external and most especially self-imposed they labor under.) and analyzed themselves. The Tleilaxu definitely shatter the restriction on  doing all biological tinkering through 'natural' techniques, but they could do so much more with sentient machines, why don't they?

Remember DM when Scytale causally dropped the hat?

"Oh by the way, that KH, which has been the nearly sole goal of your sisterhood for time immemorial for sixty or whatever generations, that KH which endlessly obsesses you and is arguably the most vital force in our universe, well, we whipped one up over the weekend with our unstoppable genetic techniques. Pretty interesting really."

I ask you, why would the Sisterhood do things so inefficiently when as far as I can tell, there is no reason other than *irrational* reasons left over from the Butlerian Jihad?

Their origin sheds no light on their continued adherence millennia later.

# The real story

## Projections of _Dune 7_

## My own analysis

Why is Paul forced into the Jihad? Off-hand, I'm working with two theories. One, his early prescient visions on Caladan and the exact alignment of forces and social tensions forced him into it, and two, his son Leto reached backwards into time and forced him to engage in the Jihad, as that was the only way Paul would survive, his first son would die, and Leto II would rule universe and bring about the Golden Path. This latter theory is supported by the failure of Paul's otherwise perfect prescient vision in DM, the codicil to Dune which says that users of power are always controlled by greater powers, and players/users are frequently manipulated or controlled for another purpose than the one they perceive, and that that is doubly so for prescient users. There are a few quotes that support this as well, but I don't have them handy.

> I seem to remember in Heretics of Dune and God Emperor of Dune, when Leto II is on the path to becoming the Worm, that he alludes to his Father Paul not having the strength to follow through with this path. I've always found this interesting as it forced me to re-evaluate everything that Paul did. Perhaps Paul chose the Jihad as he could not bear the thought of becoming the Worm / God Emperor.

One of the single most interesting bits of the 6 novels is Appendix III of _Dune_. On the surface, it seems simply to point out that the Bene Gesserit ignored obvious clues that a cataclysm was coming. But if you read it carefully, it seems to say that the Bene Gesserit were *made* to ignore them and cooperate with Paul's rise:

> The Bene Gesserit program had as its target the breeding of a person they labeled "Kwisatz Haderach," a term signifying "one who can be many places at once." In simpler terms, what they sought was a human with mental powers permitting him to understand and use higher order dimensions.
> They were breeding for a super-Mentat, a human computer with some of the prescient abilities found in Guild navigators.
> ...
> The Lady Jessica was ordered to produce an Atreides daughter. The plan was to inbreed this daughter with Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, a nephew of the Baron Vladimir, with the high probability of a Kwisatz Haderach from that union. Instead, for reasons she confesses have never been completely clear to her, the concubine Lady Jessica defied her orders and bore a son.
> This alone should have alerted the Bene Gesserit to the possibility that a wild variable had entered their scheme.
> ...
> 5. When the Arrakis Affair boiled up, the Spacing Guild made overtures to the Bene Gesserit. The Guild hinted that its navigators, who use the spice drug of Arrakis to produce the limited prescience necessary for guiding spaceships through the void, were "bothered about the future" or saw "problems on the horizon." This could only mean they saw a nexus, a meeting place of countless delicate decisions, beyond which the path was hidden from the prescient eye. This was a clear indication that some agency was interfering with higher order dimensions!
> (A few of the Bene Gesserit had long been aware that the Guild could not interfere directly with the vital spice source because Guild navigators already were dealing in their own inept way with higher order dimensions, at least to the point where they recognized that the slightest misstep they made on Arrakis could be catastrophic. It was a known fact that Guild navigators could predict no way to take control of the spice without producing just such a nexus. The obvious conclusion was that someone of higher order powers was taking control of the spice source, yet the Bene Gesserit missed this point entirely!)
> In the face of these facts, one is led to the inescapable conclusion that the inefficient Bene Gesserit behavior in this affair was a product of an even higher plan of which they were completely unaware!

If you read this even more carefully, a thought may occur to you. If we say that the 'even higher plan' was merely that caused by Paul's very earliest visions on Caladan, then there are still some mysteries here. How could Paul influence as a child his mother's decision to bear a son and not a daughter? If the master plan was Paul's, why was he forced into exile and death? Paul tells us all throughout Dune and Dune Messiah that he is as trapped as anyone else.

Whose master plan was it? Whose vision locked everyone into the Duneverse's history?

Another quote for your perusal from _Dune Messiah_:

> Without melange, Paul-Muad'dib could not prophesy.
> We know this moment of supreme power contained failure. There can be only one answer, that completely accurate and total prediction is lethal.
> Other histories say Muad'dib was defeated by obvious plotters -- the Guild, the Sisterhood and the scientific amoralists of the Bene Tleilex with their Face-Dancer disguises. Other histories point out the spies in Muad'dib's household. They make much of the Dune Tarot which clouded Muad'dib's powers of prophecy. Some show how Muad'dib was made to accept the services of a ghola, the flesh brought back from the dead and trained to destroy him. But certainly they must know this ghola was Duncan Idaho, the Atreides lieutenant who perished saving the life of the young Paul.
> Yet, they delineate the Qizarate cabal guided by Korba the Panegyrist. They take us step by step through Korba's plan to make a martyr of Muad'dib and place the blame on Chani, the Fremen concubine.
 > How can any of this explain the facts as history has revealed them?
They cannot. Only through the lethal nature of prophecy can we
understand the failure of such enormous and far-seeing power.
> Hopefully, other historians will learn something from this revelation.
> -Analysis of History: Muad'dib by Bronso of Ix


There's an interesting little sub-project I try to keep an eye on: I'm trying to figure out how far back is Paul trapped? Is he trapped by prescience even before the book starts? Was his vision of Chani asking Paul to tell her about the waters of his homeworld a full prescient vision, and in a twisted way directly responsible for the Atreides getting Arrakis with all that ensues?


That's one of the possibilities, but by no means sure. Here are some
quotes from _Dune Messiah_:

>    Ravenous hunger seized her [Chani] as she sat up. She fed on the food kept by the bedside -- spicebread, a heavy cheese.

How much spice could be in a diet of spicebread & cheese? And even
Paul doesn't know why the twins were awake:

>    Paul sagged against the wall in a spasm of dizziness. He felt that he'd been upended and drained. His own life whipped past him. He saw his father. He was his father. And the grandfather, and the grandfathers before that. His awareness tumbled through a mind-shattering corridor of his whole male line.
>    "How?" he asked silently.
>    Faint word-shapings appeared, faded and were gone, as though the strain was too great. Paul wiped saliva from the corner of his mouth. He remembered the awakening of Alia in the Lady Jessica's womb. But there had been no Water of Life, no overdose of melange this time . . . or had there? Had Chani's hunger been for that? Or was this somehow the genetic product of his line, foreseen by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?

On a side note, reading through DM, I find again hints of something
that perplexes me: could prescience work backwards?

>    "There was no choice," Paul said. "You understand that, Duncan?"
>    "I understand."
>    "There are some things no one can bear. I meddled in all the possible futures I could create until, finally, they created me."

But that remains a mystery to me.

I do not think there is any "ideal society". R. A. Lafferty would be quick to point out that an ideal society is a "utopia", and we all know the literal meaning of More's coining. Consider- if there was *a* perfect society, then why was it mentioned baldly to us during the events of the Honored Matres that there were paradises settled during the Scattering, and that their inhabitants grew soft and mentally died?

>       Thus the "old empire" is a constant entity in terms  of its populace, which brings in the oft-quoted phrase of the final two  novels: "rot at the core spreads outward".

Yes, it was quite deliberately that way; none of the power groups wanted it to changes- they had too much to lose and not apparently anything to gain. Why else did the Guild curtail exploration and colonization?

>       Stagnation was a tool that Leto II used to inspire  the Scattering, which ultimately lead to the survival of the species  beyond the ever-stagnant old empire.
>       Thus we take as fact that the "ideal society" in  Frank Herbert's Dune is one that has within it the seeds of its own  propagation, rather than, as Marx stated, the "seeks of its own  destruction".

Why not both? Aside from purely Herbert/General Semantic metaphysical assertions and bromides like "we all see only part of the truth", we also have the consideration that both could well be true- haven't we all seen flowers or mushrooms which sort of explode or shatter- destroying themselves but casting adrift their seeds?

I've sometimes wondered whether the BT and BG were supposed to be a dyad like the Atreides and Harkonnens; you could interpret the BG as "training" the mind to the point where the body follows its lead and becomes awesome, and the BT as "training" (in a very loose sense!) the body to the point where the mind follows its lead and becomes awesome. This is partially supported by the fact that the BT and BG do some similar things in different ways. Have you ever considered serial gholas to be a physical method of a Reverend Mother's memories? Or the trained dwarf Bijaz to be marginally equivalent to Feyd-Rautha's implanted
conditioning?
Re: HMs... the irony there is the corruption of the Reverend Mother i.e. "Revered Mother" ~ "Honored Matre/Mother".

> "...They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way of this--the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad." (Berkley PB, movie cover edition)

More interesting is *who* unleashed the Dune Tarot to muddy the currents of time, and most prominently the Emperor's vision?

I believe it should be ascribed to the BG. They would have preserved the Tarot from our time, could have made use of it throughout the millennia (I doubt the Spacing Guild would see any use for it; they would be more attracted to I Ching divinations, IMO), and are known to adapt old powerful religious myths for more modern consumption. So they have means, and they certainly have motive: they were part of the conspiracy, remember.


# The Empire



Hebert said several times, (in something that is practically axiomatic to any infinite universe) that anything that could happen out 'there', where 'there' is the many Hubble-volumes/universes that the foldspace drive, and the no-ships vanish to, will happen.

It is not surprising then that an Empire would rise there.  Many things would; I have heard it said that the Guild restricted its explorations because it was afraid of what returnees from long forgotten Scatterings might do to it.

But one of the many Empires would have discovered new uses, new extensions to the Holtzman equations. Again, this is not surprising: we should expect at least one transcendent genius among the Scatterers. He would of course have access to the Holtzmann equations, since he and his forebears would have been transported to their homeworld by a Holtzmann drive.  This, incidentally, is how those two Face Dancers could see and try to trap Duncan whilst he was in a cloaked no-ship.

With an ability to nullify the greatest advantage of a defending force, the invisibility of no-globes, this Empire would have waxed greatly, becoming extraordinarily powerful.  And that is only if that is the only extension to the Holtzmann equations our lone genius managed to produce. There are two reasons to believe he greatly improved the efficiency of cloaking: First, in CH:D (I think) one of the sisters reveals that they had considered cloaking the entire planet- but the energy requirements made it infeasible.  Stealthing works on volume not surface area, and we all know how volume varies with radius, no?  It would require the output of a g-star to cloak a planet.  Which leads to the second tidbit: Duncan recurrently dreams/prime-sums an invisible player, an entire planet cloaked and moving without being moved. It is reasonable to suppose that this protected that Empire was protected from the Honored Matres that way. It in fact seems a dual hallmark of the invisible empire and the HMs: The HMs are blind to what they cannot immediately see, and the invisible empire seems to work through exploiting that weakness.  Also, we are repeatedly given to understand that they are composed at least partly of super-Face Dancers, whether through the internal thoughts of the couple at the end, or through Waff ominously mentioning that their ultimate goal was a Face Dancer who was better than even a t-probe, but couldn't be defeated as easily as a T-probe with shere.  This ties in perfectly with the couple, who are part of the Empire.

Some closing thoughts: we know that the HMs are not the final word from the Scattering.  Someone developed the Futars, things one would expect of Bene Tleilaxu.  One more piece of evidence in favor of the Empire being comprised a little of Face Dancers.  Similarly the HMs are reluctant to use their secret death weapons (another use of Holtzmann?  Warpspace manipulated matter and time, shields even more directly so.  A subtle distortion of space could kill a human in many ways.), saying that they had been depleted in battles against their other foe.

On Gammu Prime, we are given a brief glimpse of interstellar finance and power, swirling through the common nexus of the old Empire.  Not all bankers there were HMs. Indeed, it seems that they were in the minority.  Besides the invisible empire, who else was maneuvering there?  It is unclear.

Can you imagine a Face Dancer, with the skills of hundreds of BG, the knowledge of the BT, abilities of the HM, new and unimagined Holtzmann tools and weapons, Mentat abilities, a scattering of prescience etc?  Wouldn't that be the pinnacle of human evolution, of adaptability and survivability?  Where beyond that in an infinite universe could FH go?  What better pot of gold at the end of the Golden Path could Leto have caused? I certainly can't think of a better.
I hope this helps and doesn't drive you fruitier :)

What I found interesting in this chapter is not so much the Matres, although the cynicism is always interesting and I cannot help but be chilled by their methods of retaining power and their teachings to the 'scum' - I inevitably think of people like Noam Chomsky, especially given what went before: what's really interested me is Teg's analysis of the banking shows that much more than seems is going on. There are vast flows of capital, relations between mighty powers and interests greater even than CHOAM, which in the first trilogy was the sole object of interest of the Emperor and all the houses - CHOAM was not seen as an autonomous power in its own right, akin to the Guild, but as the prize; remember the Harkonnens sought primarily a permanent seat of CHOAM's board, and it was CHOAM shares which determined the Emperor's right to rule - so mighty even that they apparently ignore the conflict between BG and HM, seeking the Old Empire only as a mutually known and agreeable meeting spot.

A good point.
.....
"You deliberately let them get away, Daniel!"

The old woman rubbed her hands down the stained front of her garden apron.  It was a summer morning around her, flowers blooming, birds calling from nearby trees.  There was a misty look to the sky, a yellow radiance near the horizon.

"Now, Marty, it was not deliberate," Daniel said.  He took off his porkpie hat and rubbed the bushy stubble of gray hair before replacing the hat.  "He surprised me.  I knew he saw us but I didn't suspect he saw the net."

"And I had such a nice planet picked out for them," Marty said.  "One of the best.  A real test of their abilities."
.....
Actually, re-reading it, I see an interesting line I never noticed before:
.....
"That Master is going to have trouble if he tries to mess with that big one," Daniel said, snipping off a ground shoot from the root stock of his roses.  "My, this is a pretty one."

"Mentats, too!"  Marty called.  "I'd have told them.  Dime a dozen, they are."

"Dimes?  I don't think they'd have understood that, Marty.  The Reverend Mothers, yes, but not that big Mentat.  He didn't thin out that far back."
.....
I don't understand what the use of 'thin' here means. It seems to
somehow refer to composite identities (one identity being thick, and
thinning out being incorporating multiple identities into one, like BG
Mothers do?).
