[A chapter](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/65/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality) in a fanfiction reminded me of an old philosophical point about [contradictions](!Wikipedia "Principle of explosion") and tautologies - that they imply everything else. Lawful systems stand and [fall](!Wikipedia "Confirmation holism") as a whole; you cannot magically suppress [fire](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/) without suppressing [cellular respiration](!Wikipedia) and human life. And so, in some sense, all our actions result in consequences that could one day by examined and tracked back to their unique sources ([chaos](!Wikipedia "Chaos theory") be damned).

Thinking this, and looking into the falling snow, I thought through a haiku (5-7-5):

    Every lie or truth
    remains under all snow - if
    we can but find it

This sounded familiar to me, though I didn't think I had been quoting anyone. Eventually, I remembered [Shōtetsu](!Wikipedia)'s "Snow in a Garden"^[#123 in _Unforgotten Dreams: Poems by the Zen monk Shōtetsu_; trans. Steven D. Carter, ISBN 0-231-10576-2]

    "Every shrub, every tree -
    if one has not forgotten
    where they were planted -
    has beneath the fallen snow
    some vestige of its form."

A very nice [waka](!Wikipedia); truly conveying a sad mood but with appreciation of the beauty of winter and the hope of spring. If one must copy, copy the best.

But the haiku needs work. The first line is solid: the rhythm of 'lie and truth' works better than 'truth or lie', and it meets its 5-syllable count with aplomb. The second line is awkward, even if you ignore the [enjambment](!Wikipedia). 'All snow' may convey a sense that nothing is irretrievable, which is an appropriate sentiment, but sounds odd enough that it breaks the flow. Expanding it would let us be less gnomic and keep each line separate, but we daren't touch the perfect first line. Let's try this expanded waka (5-7-5-7-6):

    Every lie or truth,
    that we humans ever say,
    remains for to find
    under time's covering
    and silent embraces

In line 3, the intention is 'remains for *us* to find', but that blows the 5-syllable count; 'for to find' is actually valid English, but it's archaic or British dialectical (if one looks in Google Books, [Edmund Spenser](!Wikipedia) comes up as a user of that phrase lo those many centuries ago). It's curious, but such linguistic oddities are par for the course in poetry, so perhaps it's not a flaw. The more I read it, the more charm it has for me in a sort of [wabi-sabi](!Wikipedia) way, which is appropriate for the verse-form. (It was suggested that it be rewritten as 'remains here to find' or 'remains there to find', but in a way, no 'here' or 'there' has been specified for the lies & truths to reside within, and we do want to keep a distinction between the speaker/addressed and the snowbanks of time - "the past is a foreign country"[^past], after all.)

'human' is fairly rare in poems, because usually you can come up with a better phrase. In this case, we're stuck. We could switch to 'man' or 'men' and that would let us stick in a short adjective like 'warm':

    Every lie or truth,
    that we warm men ever say,
    remains for to find
    under time's covering
    and silent embraces

But to me, that seems like a narrowing of scope that isn't in line with the universal sentiments. Why *men*? Are women grown honest? The synonym 'people' sounds even worse than 'humans':

    Every lie or truth,
    that we people ever say,
    remains for to find
    under time's covering
    and silent embraces

Pronouns aside, there are two problems here.

1. The metaphor for time is not clear. We know that the idea is the past is cold, and the further in the past, the colder and more frozen the lies & truths (this is not a new metaphor; consider the phrase [cold case](!Wikipedia)). It's a good metaphor, since you can still dig things out of the snow, and things return when the snow melts (this is why Shōtetsu, a Zen Buddhist, uses the imagery after all). But time doesn't instantly suggest it - the 'covering' could just be a blanket or something.
2. We lost our most important line - the punchline, if you will. It's a double-edged sword, one that can reassure or disquiet: *the truth is out there*. Darst you find it?[^superknowledges] We try again (5-7-5-7-7):

        Every lie or truth
        that we humans ever say
        remains for to find
        in Time's snowy embraces -
        if we will but look for them

A little more explicit about the metaphor: 'snowy' is pretty much a winter word if ever there was one, and we capitalize Time to make the [hypostatization](!Wikipedia) clearer.

Around here, it occurred to me that line 2 did have a redundant word: 'that'. It makes as much sense to write 'Every lie or truth / we humans ever say' as it did to write 'Every lie or truth / that we humans ever say'; freeing up a syllable then suggests we spend it on more interesting pronouns, which leads to:

    Every lie or truth
    you or I will ever say
    remains for to find
    in Time's snowy embraces -
    if we will but look for them

This is a very nice change, because it eliminates the whole debate over 'we humans', makes the poem simultaneously intimate (it's just you and me, buckaroo) and universal (the speaker could be anyone, and likewise the addressed), renders the poem less harshly judgmental of its readers (I too am guilty of not seeking all truths and destroying all lies), and smuggles in variety.

The meaning is still somewhat obscure overall thanks to the last line. Perhaps we ought to go with a more conventional visual description: 'darksome'? 'cloudy'? 'obscure'? Or perhaps the last line is too limp and abstract - 'if we will but dig for them'? 'If we scratch the dirt'? Perhaps that is *too* concrete. 'If we exhume them' smacks of the grave and doesn't go well with the ice/snow imagery. There aren't many verbs that deal specifically with ice & snow; 'melt' is a good one, but 'if we will but melt them'? No no, perhaps 'if we will melt the ice', and then tweak the 'snowy' to another 2-syllable word like 'icy' or 'freezing':

    Every lie or truth
    you or I will ever say
    remain for to find
    in Time's icy embrace -
    if we will but melt the ice

The repetition of 'icy'/'ice' doesn't work for me. Even if we move 'icy' even further away, it still sounds odd:

    Every lie or truth
    you or I will ever say
    remain for to find
    in icy Time's embrace -
    if we will but melt the ice

(And no, the old poetic standby '[rimy](!Wiktionary)' is even worse. We must give up on 'snowy' and 'icy'.)

So:

    Every lie or truth
    you or I will ever say
    remain for to find
    in Time's freezing embraces -
    if we will but melt the ice

        "The lake steams
        as if its floor is furious coal.
        Dredge it and see.

        But who is brave enough to know a difficult thing?
        To look for ghosts?"

[^past]: From _Learning History in America_ by Lloyd S. Kramer, Donald Reid, William L. Barney; pg 145:

        "For we can always see and feel much that the people in old photos and newsreels could not:

        that their clothing and automobiles were old-fashioned,
        that their landscape lacked skyscrapers and other contemporary buildings,
        that their world was black
         and white
          and haunting
           and gone."
