> This very short story began at the hands of another, as `eien_meru`'s ["A crow shook down on me"](http://www.everything2.com/user/eien_meru/writeups/A+crow+shook+down+on+me). I saw it linked as a [Borgesian](!Wikipedia "Jorge Luis Borges") story - my favorite kind - and thought I could do better. When I had finished, I re-read
 it and realized I had written a reply to another story that had [horrified me](http://lesswrong.com/lw/536/open_thread_april_2011/3thd), [Ted Chiang](!Wikipedia)'s story about the [Book of Job](!Wikipedia) & the [theodicy](!Wikipedia): ["Hell is the Absence of God"](http://readr.ru/ted-chiang-hell-is-the-absence-of-god.html).

<!-- TODO: link this page on Everything2 -->

The world is a grid of sandstone columns, one meter apart. By this fearful symmetry, I can calculate the surface of the universe: sixty-five thousand, five hundred, and thirty-six square meters. Beyond, the sere breeze of the wild blue. In the middle, stands the last minaret, where I read the Quran in peace. And from it, I can see how the corners are discolored, though each pillar seems of a piece with its neighbors.

And I am the warden of these last men, these ashamed beasts who refused Heaven. I will never know their nameless faces. I imagine them crying out as their skin wears away. Maybe each day they feel a murder of crows pecking. Or they feel each day that they are less, with the memory of being more. Maybe it is not painful. As the [long clock](!Wikipedia "Clock of the Long Now") reckons, I call out the prayer to the faithful. None come.

And on that forgotten day when I became the caretaker of this graveyard, I calculated its decay to know the length of my durance. At every count, I weary and perhaps forget; yet I have at last finished. So I say with certainty that if I read but one verse of the holy book each day, before the end I will have read it more times than all the faithful have ever read scripture.

And did not Allah intend different messages for those different readers? So I have begun a new game - each time I read the Book, I make myself another. At the end, I will finally understand.
