     I sent away for:

     a four year course (Bachelor of Science) -
     certified, cheap, easy, genuine.

     In the first I follow your aorta to the ventricles - susurring.
     In the second I get lost in the swirling veins - just thinking.
     In the third one rests in the chamber to the left - for one has a heart.
     In the fourth one moves to the chamber to the right - for one has a brain.

     My tools are ready. They are:
     the noise of a cat's footfall,
     the toupee of a tortoise
     (and matching woman's beard),
     springy rabbit horns
     bound with rock-roots &
     greased with fish-spit,
     clothed in sky-flowers.

     With them I tumble your ribs:
     deftly in, deftly out.

     I know those summers so long ago
     in that enormously forgotten house
     kept so close in your heart:

     that night when you see two bumblebees
     on the possessed apple-tree,
     when she shouts 'olly-olly oxenfree'
     and dashes into your aching knees,
     when you supped on honey and raspberries.

     For I will simmer the dark honey
     and I will ice-cool the raspberries.
     Placing them by your bed, by your keys,
     you will never know the dish was me.

     For I am the world's greatest safecracker.
