The darkness before Dawn is lithe, live,
And as it coils, it circumscribes sight,
sealing a small world without others.
And one feels wrapped in this world,
warm (no matter the weather),
And forgets their fear - by humans forlorn.

Because we are porcupines, poking each other
And though we want to walk together,
Always our shadow shows behind us
And from our hearts fear has not fled.
It reminds us to remain on guard,
And includes our intimate friends as
Eternal enemies whose shadows are strange,
And not ours.
