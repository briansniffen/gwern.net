    But we all will be alone,
    moving just in memory,
    someday, eventually, so:
    show no sorrow, love and laugh,
    bravely walk with no wish but
    to live while you will live
    and not forget these feelings.

    See your school yard -
    blanched blackboards,
    gleaming grinders,
    sharp jutting seats,
    restless paper piles rustling,
    those companions of childhood,

    as we remember:
    collecting pebbles in the corner pile,
    chattering excitedly as we cache each -
    the soft smooth tar-drop;
    second, glass sand-ground.

    As we remember:
    dashing through the double trees
    jumping by jammed branches
    flashing to free trapped friends.

    As we remember:
    boy secrets on bricks scribbled,
    the rain the only reader.

    As we remember:
    sunlight shafting through the silent school.
