    we will all be alone someday
    living only in memory

    Think of the school:
    blank blackboards,
    sharp jutting seats,
    (the restless piles of paper rustle),
    as we remember:

    collecting pebbles in the corner pile,
    chattering excitedly as we cache each -
    the soft smooth tar-drop,
    second, glass sand-ground.

    As we remember:
    dashing through the double trees
    jumping by jammed branches
    flashing to free trapped friends.

    As we remember:
    boy secrets on bricks scribbled,
    the rain the only reader.

    As we remember:
    sunlight shafting through the silent school.
