description: Poem about ALS
...

A poem for [Hal Finney](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ab/dying_outside/):

    He will die outside, he says.
    Flawed flesh betrayed him,
    it has divorced him -
    for the brain was left him,
    but not the silverware
    nor the limbs nor the car.

    So: he will take up
    a brazen hussy,
    tomorrow's Eve,
    a breather-for-him,
    a pisser-for-him.

    He will be letters,
    delivered slowly;
    deliberation
    his future watch-word.

    He would not leave until he left this world.

    I try not to see his mobile flesh,
    how it will sag into eternal rest,
    but what he will see:

    endless plans for a
    mind forever voyaging
    on strange seas of thought
