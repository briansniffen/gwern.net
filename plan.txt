# General:
- Learn to write with left-hand?
- Email Douglas Lenat about the Eurisko source code.

# Buying:
If this list seems small, it's because I try to want few things. I have a fear of being overmastered by possessions - 'Things are in the saddle and ride mankind.' So I try to get only things I really want, or things that will replace other things. I don't always satisfy it, but my policy is for every new thing, 1 or 2 old things go. Perhaps someone else would enjoy it more, or it could be sold, or go to charity. It doesn't have to sit in my room, burdening my mind ever so little, and obstructing my eye every so often. I dream sometimes of having so little that I could live out of a footlocker; a laptop or wearable computer, a few changes of clothes, a hammock to sleep in, and little besides.
- A kit
- - A compact leatherman of some sort (not necessarily Leatherman brand - maybe a True Utility or Gerber multitool instead). After purchase, sharpen well.
- - A monocular telescope? Remember to prioritize size, night-vision, and price.
- - Survival kit. The SAS kit here looks good: <http://www.imsplus.com/ims24a.html>
- - A bandolier or leather pouch or something of that sort to put on a waist and store the kit in. See <http://www.imsplus.com/ims1c.html> for some possible buys.
- Duo Maxwell's outfit is interesting. Look it up and see if worth getting. Consists of a clergy shirt or perhaps a Kung Fu uniform top w/ all black color and trim and mandarin collar, and jodhpurs as pants.
- A tan fedora; my current one is size ~59 or 7 3/8 but it's fairly tight so I suspect I am really a size up.
- A pair of cavalier boots. Either <http://www.scaboots.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=BJ&Category_Code=1> or <http://www.renboots.com/RENblack.html>. Hard decision - Renboots is higher quality, but 275$ more! What size am I?
- 5-toe shoes: <http://www.kayakshed.com/prod/Vibram_Five_Finger_Men's_Classic.cfm>; there's also these *kevlar* soles: <http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot_info.php>
- a keyboard for Mom?
- <http://www.gallerynucleus.com/artist/kazu_kibuishi> <-- some very nice prints
- A Mario shirt: <http://www.threadless.com/product/543/This_is_not_a_Pipe>
- Revolution will not be telegraphed: <http://store.wondermark.com/pages/apparel>
- Defcon poster? <http://store.introversion.co.uk/product_info.php?products_id=56&osCsid=0ac0b9ad90f20b722f0bd7733d5a9997>
- Great science and philosophy t-shirts: <http://wearscience.com/design/germ/>
- <http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=TO&Product_Code=DC-KANT> "Kant stop the music"
- <http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=TO&Product_Code=DC-TOKAMAK-SHORT> tokamak lightning t-shirt
- _Ico_ (PS2) - looks hard to find...
- Flash drive; pref >=8gb
- Replacement hand-exercise-grip - the 9lb one is too light now: <http://www.prohands.net/products/pro.php> ($22...)
- Oolong tea; I like Upton's:

# Downsizing:
## Short-term:
- Computer equipment can be minimized a little more. Going with wireless networking would eliminate one wire at the cost of security, speed, and driver support - so that may not be worthwhile. However, there are apparently Bluetooth keyboards which can last months without recharging, and similar headphones, so that is a viable option.

## Long-term:
- N64, Dreamcast, and PS/PS2 games and systems can probably be replaced by emulators. PS by Pcsx and PS2 by Pcsx2. Is Dreamcast provided by Xe <http://www.xe-emulator.com/> or X-MAME <http://x.mame.net/>?
- Bed/mattress/box-spring can probably be replaced by hammock. (Long-term.) <http://www.amazon.com/Hammaka-2003-HMKA-Hammock-Green-Brown/dp/B000G7CIY8/>?
- Many books can be superseded by e-books. DVDs can be ripped. (Long term; requires more hard drive space, approximately 200GB for the DVDs alone.)

# Reading:
- Read all Shakespeare's plays

# Writing:
- finish "Welcome to Ipp"
