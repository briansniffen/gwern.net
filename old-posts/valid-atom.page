title: Atom Validation
---

The [Atom 1.0][] [feed][] for this blog now validates, according to both
[feedvalidator][] and the [W3C][].  If you try to read the Atom feed
and something looks wrong, please let me know!  This doesn't mean it
works, only that it's been proven correct.  As [Knuth][] said: "Beware of
bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it."

I do know of one problem: Kat's entry on AT&T has the right link in
the entry (to `AT&amp;T.html`), but NetNewsWire sends the link from the
title to `AT&T.html`, which doesn't exist.
