title: Apology: Augustus Caesar

The Economist ran a correction on page 101 of the 3 November issue.  I
know they're known to lean towards the Right---quite far in most
cases, by standards that include Hugo Chavez in the mean.  They lean
blindly in a few cases, I suppose.  But I had no idea that they were
this conservative:

> **Apology: Augustus Caesar** In our review last week of Lucien
> Polastron's book on libraries we said that Augustus had destroyed
> the Alexandrian library in 48BC.  Since the lad, then called
> Octavian, was only 15 at the time, he obviously didn't.  And Julius
> Caesar, who did, hadn't actually meant to.  We apologise to Mr
> Polastron, the many well-educated readers who have complained, and
> to Augustus, now divine.

No wonder they're so suspicious of Christian influence in government.
Clearly, they'll throw us all to the lions, and are opposed to
Christianity's tax-heavy policies---after all, the founding prophet
said "Give to Caesar!"
