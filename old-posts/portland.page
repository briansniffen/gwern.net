title: I've spent most of this week in Portland, OR on business.  It's a nice
---
place to visit.  I've been staying at the Red Lion Inn.  They have a
big statue of their mascot in the parking lot:

Sadly, the place wasn't very clean, the desk service sucked, they use
the same awful perfume as Holiday Inn.  Outside the desk of the Red
Lion Inn, there's a friendly, open culture: people feel about as
fast-paced as New England, but with smiles more similar to the
Midwest.  And they do have a sense of humor:

I took time last night to go visit [Powell's Books][powells], a
bookseller the size of a city block.  It's a warren of little rooms,
much larger than the average Borders Books---and much more dense.
Unlike Borders, there was value to wandering around and seeing what
the structure of the store suggested to my eyes.  I'd love to find a
place like this in Boston.  Even the smell was right.  It takes a
decade or so for a bookstore to soak in the smell of paper, glue, and
cedar.

They didn't have a copy of [*Dzur*][dzur] yet, but I did find a number of
books to go look at later.  One book on [supercharged overachieving
kids][overachievers]; one nice [history of algebra][algebra] and its transition from seeking
solutions to equations to consideration of groups; one [history of
Jefferson's oratory][jefferson] (thanks to Justin Sheehy); Seth Lloyd's book on
[modeling the universe as quantum computation][quantum]; a tempting copy of
[*House of Leaves*][hol] (on my list thanks to Jon Herzog)... and one
Certified Lunatic.  This is Helen Caldicott:

The first thing I heard her say was that [Pebble Bed Reactors][pebble] embed
fissile materials in millions of graphite spheres---and that graphite
is what burned at Chernobyl.  Then she said that they tried to hide
the contamination at Chernobyl, and now they say Pebbled Beds are
walk-away safe, immune to meltdown.  Her opinion on other energy
sources was similar: that the world can run on renewable energy, and
all it takes is some smart people thinking about it.  Also, that Bush
and Cheney are both so foolish as to not understand these principles
of nuclear engineering---clear to literati such as herself---and
malevolent and scheming enough to interfere with all the smart people
trying to fix the world.  This was in support of her new book.  Most
of the audience ate it up, but as I was leaving I saw one gentleman
with a big gold block on his right ring finger start to question her
scientific facts and press her on her descriptions of DU ammunition,
Uranium extraction, enrichment, and depletion, and advanced chemical
recovery of nuclear waste.  That made me proud and happy---so I left
before the audience could shout him down.

Now it's time to head to the airport, carefully checking everything
liquid.  PDX-DEN-BOS, and I should be home by 1am Eastern Time.
