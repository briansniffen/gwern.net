Why would I buy a Tivo when I can buy one of these [Hannibal][]
devices?  I understand that a Tivo has advantages of ease-of-use for
many users---but if I'm not in the least bothered by a command line,
why not buy one of these?  It looks like CLI interaction should be
quite rare---that this really is an appliance.  What does Tivo offer
that this system won't have?  Is it worth a subscription fee?

It's nice to see some competition starting.  When CableCARD tuners are
available, I hope to see more of these devices.
