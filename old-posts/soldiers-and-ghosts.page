title: Soldiers and Ghosts
---

Professor Ted Lendon of the University of Virginia, formerly of
M.I.T., has a new book out.  [Soldiers and
Ghosts](http://www.amazon.com/Soldiers-Ghosts-History-Classical-Antiquity/dp/0300119798/sr=1-1/qid=1164495771/ref=sr_1_1/102-1866322-3727344?ie=UTF8&s=books)
is written to be accessible to a general audience.  It addresses the
evolution of land warfare over the period of antiquity.

Lendon had a justifiably devoted following at the Institute.  Many in
Cambridge still remember him fondly.
