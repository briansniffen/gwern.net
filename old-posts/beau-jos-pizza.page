title: Notes from Denver: Beau Jo's Pizza
---

I've been hearing about their [gourmet mountain pies](http://www.beaujos.com/) for some time.  This trip, I got to see
a menu and eat a pie.  These are pizzas sold by the pound.  Says the
menu:

> One pound: 1-2 people or one voracious wolverine.
>
> Two pounds: 2-3 people or a half-dozen mongeese.
>
> Three pounds: 4-5 people or two Diamese gorillas
>
> Five pounds: 6-7 people or one wooly mammoth*
>
> (*) It is currently impossible to acquire a wooly mammoth.
