Now, this isn't quite useful to me.  Starbucks' brewed coffee is
burned and not very good.  Their beans are roasted to make good
espresso, well past the point where they still make good coffee.  So I
order their Americano went I want a cup of coffee.  But just the news
that McDonald's is serving better coffee that Starbucks brewed is
interesting.
