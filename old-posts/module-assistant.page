title: Debian's module-assistant
---

Building openafs modules for Debian has always felt a bit clunky.  It
was nice when Debian shipped them, but I understand what drove them to
stop.  The new module-assistant package is a great solution.  This is
so easy that I can talk those not really competent to build a kernel
through the process.  Thanks to Eduard Bloch for writing and packaging
it, and to all who contributed ideas.
