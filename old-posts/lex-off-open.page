Lexicons are now up at <http://lexicon.wiki.evenmere.org/> for the
[Conspiracy][] and [Imperium][] game threads mentioned [previously][].

[Conspiracy]: http://lexicon.wiki.evenmere.org/ConspiracyLexicon
[Imperium]: http://lexicon.wiki.evenmere.org/ImperiumLexicon
[previously]: http://evenmere.org/blog/bts/next-campaign.html
