title: xkcd does something not funny
---

Normally [xkcd][] is just a very funny, geeky web comic.  In some ways
it fills the holes left by *The Far Side* and *PLIF*.  His most recent
[text post][] is worth reading for reasons having nothing to do with
humor.

I'd read Washington's Farewell Address before, but it's hard to get a
sense of the scope.  Individual paragraphs make sense, but the rhythm
of political dialogue has shifted somewhat.
