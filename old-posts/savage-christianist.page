title: Christianist
---

Dan Savage uses a word in this week's [column][] that I haven't seen
before: Christianist.  By analogy with [Islamist][], its meaning is
clear.  I like it quite a bit.  I'm happy to see any term that helps
make clear that Pat Robertson doesn't represent most Christian
Americans---that for most Christians in this country, our perception
of Jesus Christ as the light of the world and our desire to build
America as a [city][] upon a hill are completely unrelated.

I'm pretty sure Savage didn't originate the word.  Wikipedia
references it and connects it to [Dominionism][].  That's a bit less
catchy, for all its [1220](http://www.atlas-games.com/arsmagica/)
connections.  Just as we should discourage Islamist government abroad,
we should discourage Christianist government here---and encourage good
Christians, Muslims, Atheists, Pastafarians, and anybody else into
government based on their political policies..
