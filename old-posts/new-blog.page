title: New Web Log Engine

[Blosxom][] is built on [Perl][].  [PyBlosxom][] is built on
[Python][].  Why put in the effort to switch?  The langauge might make
me pick PyBlosxom to begin with---and I did consider it back when I
started this---but it's hardly enough to switch for.  PyBlosxom is
maintained; Blosxom largely forks with each user.  PyBlosxom has a
cleanly added on method for interpreting `$variables`.  Blosxom
appears to `eval()` the text.  And maybe the comments.

It may be that I'm mistaken about what Blosxom might do---doesn't
really matter, if it's taking long enough for me to have to worry
about it, I start to consider whether it'll take less time to switch.
As it turns out, PyBlosxom also supports the [Blogger][] XML-RPC upload
mechanism, and has better support for [Technorati][], [TrackBack][], and
similar services.  So this web log now runs on PyBlosxom.

I've added redirectors at the old URLs, but this is now best accessed
