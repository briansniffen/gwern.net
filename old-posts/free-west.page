And he also links to [an example][cape] of Sharansky's Town Square
Test.  My local community had its own version a year or so ago, when
MIT's administration methodically invented new "safety" rules until it
could forbid the posting of Israeli flags in dormitory windows,
visible from the street.  It was instigated by Muslim students
offended by the view.  It was clear that everybody involved understood
the real purpose of the exercise: to extract that office of the
administration from the midpoint of an ethnic conflict.  Those damn
ethnics, getting their local border wars in the way of a safe, quiet
school.  Better to just make both sides shut up and go away.

But one of those sides is our side.  We don't always have to agree
with its *government* or its policies---I'm not a fan of their
copyright laws, for example---but we must not sit by in a fight
between the past and the future.  The state of Israel, a
representative democracy, is part of the future.  The groups of
strongmen and feudalists in Gaza, southern Lebanon, and Iran are the
past.  If they win, we get to repeat the last millennium  of history, an
empire falling and a climb out of darkness again.

The civilization we enjoy is a thin crust over an ocean of barbarism.
We can debate policy with our civilized opponents, but have no shared
axioms with barbarians.  When we do not even share the desire to raise
our families in peace, left alone, what do we have?  I can talk about
the copyright policy of Israel, about disagreements over points of
contract law.  Can we debate such details of policy with Hezbollah?
With Teheran?  With the democratically elected government of the
Palestinian Authority?  Until we can, we've got to remember: civil
debate within the family of civilization, and an unyielding wall
against the barbaric night outside.

I can't reasonably wear a cape to the office.  But I have prepared
[this sign][sign], with the flags of the US, Great Britain and its
Commonwealth, and Israel: it really is Brittania and her far-flung
children who have maintained the rule of law, and now compose the Free
West.

Print one out and post it in your office.  But be prepared to answer
some very scary questions!  The flags will offend the Left, and the
words will offend Republicans.  I'm not sure how Transnationalists,
Objectivists, and Orthogonal Moderates will take it.  But since I've
got some of each on my hallway, perhaps I'll find out.
