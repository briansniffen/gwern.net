title: Crimes Against Logic, by Jamie Whyte
---

This is subtitled "Exposing the Bogus Arguments of Politicians,
Priests, Journalists, and Other Serial Offenders."  It's a short
[treatise][]  by a graduate student in Philosophy at Cambridge.  This is
the sort of philosopher my Topologist friend might appreciate: he very
nicely slices up a variety of bullshit and serves it garnished with
humor.  It's a rah-rah book.  There's nothing in here to convince a
politician, priest, or journalist that he's wrong, or to explain
logical argument.  It does make rationalists feel good to read,
though---and at 155 tiny pages, it's not a large investment.

I remember when I would have completely understood everything in this
book.  At this point, that feels more difficult.  Now it seems like
the author doesn't understand---that some statements have purposes
other than conveying simple truths, that an argument is won in
practice by emotionally convincing an audience, not by rationally
convincing your debating partner.  The ancient art of [Disputation][]
is no longer practiced.  If about to be immersed in a designed
society, I should be very glad to know that Mr. Whyte was involved in
the design.  Since he did not construct our present culture, his
insights into how cultures *ought* to be built seem of limited
usefulness.  We can work towards that world, but we are unlikely ever
to live in it.
