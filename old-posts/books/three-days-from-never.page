title: Three Days from Never, by Tim Powers
---

Tim Powers is getting more complicated---not that I would complain.
Here he does to Charlie Chaplain and Albert Einstein what *Declare*
did to Kim Philby and T.E. Lawrence.  The plot is harder to follow
than that of Anubis Gates---in his medieval books, general,
Hollywood-style knowledge of magical practice can ground and explain
some of the convolutions.  Even in *Last Call*, that's so.  But *Three
Days from Never* has more in common with *Earthquake Weather*'s
reliance on modern, chaos-style magic.

This book is not as good as *Declare* or *Anubis Gates*.  I read it in
two sittings, for example, whereas each of those kept me up all
night.  It's still way, way better than most books I've read this
year.
