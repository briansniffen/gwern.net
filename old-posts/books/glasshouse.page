title: Glasshouse, by Charles Stross
---

This is a sequel to *Accelerando*?  Sort of.  It's in the same universe
of wormhole routers and improbable space opera on the fringes of brown
dwarves.  It goes without saying that terrestrial environments are
never encountered, for fear of the Vile Offspring.  But nothing of the
details of *Accelerando* matter here: only that this is a future far
beyond the Singularity.

To make the book comprehensible to the rest of us, the setting is
mostly from the point of view of an amnesiac embedded in a simulation
of late-twentieth-century life.  The plot is, I think, best
experiences, so I will say little more about it.

It's not necessary to have read *Accelerando* before reading
*Glasshouse*, but it's highly recommended that you watch *The
Prisoner*.  There are a lot of references, including a number of
oblique mentions of town centers with quirky, varicolored buildings.  
It's also good to have read as much as Stross---not easy.  Cordwainer
Smith is important here, and Keith Laumer helps.  Heinlein is
important, especially for early recognition of applied fascism.
