title: Summer Knight, by Jim Butcher
---

Gosh.  Maybe I should have bunched all of the Dresden files together,
like [Kat did](/katallen/books/DresdenFiles.txt).  The titular
character spends most of the book dead---a pity, since he sounded like
a neat character.  We find out more about the Nevernever here, and
about Harry's origins as a wizard.  Some bits of the cosmology aren't
covered on screen---I'd like to know more about the deals-and-gifts
obsession of the Faeries, and about their Call mechanic.

These really are candy: light, one-evening books with lots of geeky
references.  Indiana Jones makes a quick appearance here, a few pages
from J.M. Barrie.  The series is improving since *Fool Moon*, passing
*Storm Front* in quality.
