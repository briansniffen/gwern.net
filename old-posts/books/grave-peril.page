title: Grave Peril, by Jim Butcher
---

The sequel to [Storm Front](storm-front.html) improves upon it.  Lea,
Dresden's fairy godmother, gets her on-screen introduction.  I'd
rather have Don Bruce!  As Kat [says][], it also introduces the
series' best companion so far: the knight Michael.  In fact, all of
the supporting cast are more richly handled here than in Storm Front
or Fool Moon.  It's still necessary to scream at them sometimes for
their obtusity and tendency to keep secrets for no good reason---but
now at least we get to see a bit of Harry's internal reasoning for
this.

The vampire metaphysics and politics presented here are
inspiring---much like *Guilty Pleasures*, before Hamilton stopped
building a coherent world and started writing straight porn.
