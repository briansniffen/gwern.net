We've heard plenty of talk about this elsewhere, and plenty of
corrections to the phrase "merit badge": this is an activity patch,
comparable to those for attending [Philmont][] or [Sea Base][].  But
I've another concern:

> Scouts lusting after the badge...

I knew several boys during my time in Scouts who were driven by the
advancement system.  One scene from Heinlein's *Space Cadet* made an
impression on me then---the bit with the Patrol and Marine [uniforms][].
Some of the same differentiation seemed to show up among the scouts.
But even those following the path of the Space Marines never reached
to **lust** for badges.
