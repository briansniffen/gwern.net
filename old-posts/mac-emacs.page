title: Emacs keybindings in normal mac programs
---

I just hit C-x C-s by habit, while in a TextEdit.app window.  The
document was promptly saved to disk.  I'm in shock.  I don't remember
ever setting this up, but this implies something pretty weird about
the people working on TextEdit.

I'd known about single-key commands like C-a and C-e, but this means
they implemented an entire prefix-key system just to handle Emacs-like
keybindings in text widgets.
