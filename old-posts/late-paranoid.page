title: Which other IT workers have you?

Yes, quoting a Slashdot [article]() again:

There's the obvious joke in this post's title.  But there's a more
serious complaint here as well:

I would be much more interested to see the correlation the other way.
Being able to predict lateness and grumpiness after previous events of
sabotage is not very useful.  It would be useful to know if most
disgruntled, paranoid, generally late, argumentative, and off-key IT
workers later perform sabotage.  It might be useful to know if a
substantial minority of such persons become saboteurs if mistreated,
and whether this can be avoided by proper treatment.

But what good is it to know that saboteurs were once surly?  There are
too many surly IT workers to dismiss them all, or even to apply
selective treatment around dismissal time.
