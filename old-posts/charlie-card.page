title: Charlie Card efficiency
---

Once you get a Charlie Card (trivially available at the Porter Star,
even though the MBTA tells you it's only 7am-7pm), it's very nice.
Particularly, rates for me have gone *down* with the changeover.  The
card supports automatic transfers: after paying $1.25 to use the bus,
I was automatically charged only $0.45 to use the T.  Coming home
tonight, I expect to pay $1.70 for the T and receive a free bus-ride.
The old paper transfers are gone, and the rate for a combined bus+T
ride has dropped from $2.15 to $1.70.

Yes, the rate for just a subway ride has risen from $1.25 to $1.70.
