title: The Prestige
---

Kat and I saw *The Prestige* last night.  Some spoiler-free thoughts:
This is a movie about bad people doing terrible things to themselves,
each other, and everybody nearby.  My family and I came out with very
clear, distinct, and different ideas about who were justified and
righteous.  This may have something to do with the differences in when
we picked up on what was going on: those who saw some of the Keyser
S&ouml;ze moments coming tended to think better of the characters
involved, whereas those who were shocked tended to react harshly.

The editors did excellent work.  Some bits, especially during and
right after the title sequence, came out rough.
