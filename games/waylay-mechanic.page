title: Proposed waylay mechanic

### Background

The typical [Assassin's Guild][] waylay mechanic involved making a
hand-sign at somebody for 5 seconds or so.  If they haven't noticed
by the time you're done, you've knocked them out.  As Charles Hope
says,

So how do you deal with this?  You could have the surpriser just jump
out and say, "Waylay," and if the target's really surprised, he falls
down.  But this raises multiple-stance issues that the Guild
traditionally dislikes.

### Solution

Have the surpriser jump out and say "Waylay N times M" for N, M in [1,20].
If the surprisee can respond with the result quickly enough, he's not
surprised.  If he can't, he's out.
