title: Burning Empires Infection Mechanics
---

The overarching strategy game of [Burning Empires][] is the Vaylen
Infection system.  It's basically a generalized tactical game.  There
are eight maneuvers in a complicated Rock-Paper-Scissors system.  It's
complicated enough that I can't immediately detect degenerate
strategies, and I'm concerned that it might be Rock-Paper-Wet
Noodle-Scissors-Nuke.  Let's try to find out.

### Overview

Each side starts with a Disposition, a number of points.  You win when
your opponent runs out of points.  The more points you have when you
win, the less you have to compromise.  

Each turn, you and your privately opponent pick a maneuver.  Attacks
generally let you roll some dice and subtract the number of successes
from the enemy's Disposition.  Defenses let you roll some dice and let
you subtract successes from the enemy's attack dice-pool.  Each
maneuver limits the RPG-character skills you can use, and the general
action of the RPG.  For example, during the Invasion phase, you can
only Take Action with Strategy or Propaganda, but you can use
Psychohistory, Logistics, Cryptography, or Strategy for a Gambit.

Four of the maneuvers are available at the start of the game:

 * Conserve.  This is a general defense: it defends against all the
   attack maneuvers except Flak.  That is, you each roll your
   dice-pools and subtract successes.  Net successes boost your
   Disposition, or give you downtime before the next move.  That
   downtime can be useful in the next layer down, the RPG.

 * Go to Ground.  This is a general defense: it defends against all
   the attack maneuvers except Pin and Gambit.  It also defends
   against Assess.  Extra successes generate downtime, as with
   Conserve.

 * Flak.  This is a split attack (Obstacle 1) and defense, but
   requires at least three dice in each pool.  That means it can only
   be done by those with great skill, and even then it's pretty weak.
   It's opposed by Assess, Flak, and Go to Ground---all the opening
   moves but Conserve---so it looks like a strong opening technique.

 * Assess.  If you succeed in an Obstacle 2 test, and beat any
   simultaneous Flak, Go to Ground, or Assess, you can now use the
   other four maneuvers.  All the pure attacks are over there.

And four maneuvers can only be used after a successful Assess:

 * Gambit.  You pay three points of your own Disposition to use this.
   It trumps Flak and Conserve, and ignores Go to Ground.  It is also
   an Obstacle 1 attack.

 * Inundate.  Make an Obstacle 1 attack with three extra dice.  If
   this doesn't win you the fight, you skip your next turn.  This
   doesn't pull you out of the RPG, but it does mean you'll be
   defenseless in the Infection game.

 * Pin.  Make an attack, counting the opponent's skill as pure
   successes.  Instead of subtracting from Disposition, you instead
   injure his skill for the next turn.  If you reduce it to 0, he
   loses his turn entirely.  It also gets you some downtime.

 * Take Action.  This is the simple general attack at Obstacle 1.
   You can also use this to recruit other factions, boosting your own
   Disposition. 

There's a complicated little matrix of which actions oppose which
other actions.  One interesting note there is that none of the
post-Assess maneuvers oppose Assess.  Also, a game is expected to be
about six to eight turns long.

### Analysis

It's not obviously broken.  There's obviously a drive to get an Assess
in early in the game.  I can see reasonable tactics of shooting
straight for it, turtling up with Go to Ground, or just blasting away
with Flak until your opponent succeeds in his Assess.

Once you Assess and can use the interesting attacks, Pin seems
like a special case: it's OK, but mostly useful if your opponent has
weak skills in required areas like Strategy.  Inundate is also a
special case: the losses from an unopposed attack are too extreme to
make it worth it except near the end of game.

If you're OK with a compromise in the RPG and you have a very high
skill, then Gambit is a fine choice.  Since it costs three and does
expected damage of half your skill, you'd better have a skill of six
or more.  Since characters start with a maximum skill of six, they'll
need help or augments of some kind to make Gambit useful.

What happens after you each have an Assess completed?  In general,
Take Action is what you want for an attack.  The defenses are only
Flak, Go to Ground, and Conserve.  You do have to keep guessing what
your opponent will do.  Conserve and Go to Ground are both good
defenses, but since Flak, Gambit, and Pin are such rare cases, they
don't often differ.  Obviously, if your opponent is finding it useful
to Pin, you use Conserve and not Go to Ground.  If he's using Flak and
can reliably meet his obstacle, you need to Go to Ground and not
Conserve... but since Take Action opposes Flak, you never need to Go
to Ground after you both Assess.  You can safely always Take Action or
Conserve, or Flak to split the difference.  Those are the central
Aggressive, Defensive, and Split positions.  Everything else is a
relatively rare special case.
