title: Terror in the Skies
---

We just finished Terror in the Skies, using the Earthdawn Classic
rules as published by Red Brick Games.  We even got to use their
new-and-improved Grimoire casting rules in the last session.

It was a fun train-ride.  The GMing advice is less bad than in Mists
of Betrayal, but it's still firmly set in an early-90s model: the GM
has a story to have happen, and the players are expected to fight
it---or at best to not cooperate in shaping it.  Use of the combat
minigame should be frequent and need not be tied overmuch to the plot.
Combats should be to the death---there's no reason to provide
alternate outcomes.

It did have some great dramatic elements.  I was suspicious of the
ship-combat system, but it ran great: light and fast, and leading to
wonderful dramatic escapades.  It did take a little work to make sure
it didn't become a standoff-and-shell fight.  I'd just been reading
about the Scene Framing rules from *Burning Empires*, and some of last
night really made their need clear.  We spent a lot of time screwing
around.  I was too willing to let things wander into what the players
said they did next, and the players didn't feel like they had the
authority to push on to the next interesting bit.  They may not have
had the setting-knowledge to do so effectively.   When I did cut
sharply from one scene to another, the players accepted and embraced
it.  It appeared to dramatically improve the gaming.  I must study
this and improve at it.

Also, I think I now understand more of how treasure (...and take their
stuff) is supposed to work.

#### Legend Threads

We tried using a mechanic for advancement based on The Shadow of
Yesterday's "Keys" mechanic.  It didn't work so well.  Partly, I
didn't give it enough power.  Partly, it works in PC-driven games, but
has problems with railroads.  That issue can only be fixed by running
a free game, instead of using pre-generated adventures.  But I think
keys could be a nice flavor addition to a pre-generated module game if
they're given enough power, and if the base advancement rate still works.

Earthdawn already has a back-off mechanism for advancement: you need
O(fib(N)) points to advance a single skill to its next rank, and O(N)
skills must be advanced to go up a level... each to rank O(N).  So
when I added Legend Threads that needed similar advancement and only
gave out O(fib(N)), it was too slow.  You have to advance something
that's O(N^2 fib N) with something that only pays off O(fib N)---not
going to work.

A revision: Keys ought to be binary.  Either you have one or you
don't.  They cost 100C to purchase, where C is your character's
Circle.  They pay off 20C, 60C, or 100C when the tSoY equivalent
would pay off 1, 3, or 5.  If you buy one off, it pays 200C.

I do think it's worth trying a system more inspired by Burning Wheel's
Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits---possibly tied to a generalized
Karma-boost system.  More on that later.
