title: Burning Conspiracies, Part I
---

Burning Empires didn't work out too well for my group.  More on that
at a later date, perhaps---I'm reluctant to write about stresses and
tensions until I've thought about why that game failed for this group.

One bit that everybody agreed worked was the World Burner, a
collaborative mechanism for setting design.  Kasumi, a regular poster
to rpg.net, wrote a variant called [Apotheosis][] for use with
advanced Exalted games.  It's wonderful.  The important part to look
at there is Step Two, where everybody's nominating important
components: factions that are involved, can't be involved, etc.

I'd like to do something similar for a campaign I'm working on.  A few
years ago, I ran a game called Conspiracy Theories.  It was quite
successful.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but I learned a great
deal from the process of running it.  I and most of the players seemed
to have a very good time.  I liked it so much that I haven't run
anything in that genre since.  Now I'm reading Harry Dresden books,
and would like to do something like that again.

These, therefore, are thoughts on how to construct such a setting.

# Publicity

How public is magic, sorcery, the otherworldly, in this setting?  Do
vampires appear in *People*, like the Anita Blake books?  Are they
hidden, as in Dresden Files or Buffy?  Is there any public
supernatural activity at all, like Dresden's yellow-pages ad as a
Wizard?

If the magic is occult, why?  General agreement?  A faction of
guardians protecting it and killing anyone who might step out of line?
A natural force, like Paradox?  The flavor of the occult, like GURPS
Voodoo, where magic never has definite effect?  Collusion between the
aliens and the opposing government, both of whom find secrecy to their
advantage?

# Magic Style

What is in the world, and what's available to the PCs?  Collectively
figure out what might be there.

 * Dresden-style sorcery, immediate and powerful in its application?

 * Bob Howard (Atrocity Archives) magic, with slow rituals and lots of
   reading ahead of time?

 * Advanced technical gadgetry, requiring some skill and significant
   infrastructure, but usable by those not able to replicate that
   infrastructure (see the old Conspiracy Theories for some of this)

 * Psychic powers

 * I'm missing many things here: hereditary shape-shifting powers,
   sacrificial summoning... it might be best to start by letting each
   player throw in something in addition to those above.

It's very possible that only some of these will be available to the
whole PC group, and that others will be used by particular factions.
If you'd like some to not show up, ban them in the "Factions not
Present" section below.

For any that are present, it's fair game for a PC to buy into them:
the one PC psychic, alien, witch, whatever.  See Giles and then
Willow, for example.

# Backing and Cohesion

Are the PCs lone occult investigators?  Backed by a government agency?
Cooperating agents of different governments?  Part of a supernatural
conspiracy, like the Illuminati?

# Allied Factions

Go around the table.  Each player may nominate a faction allied to the
PCs.  The group should sketch out a leader or point of contact for
that faction, and his relation to the PCs, before proceeding to
nominate the next faction.

For each such faction, one PC should either have a tense and
conflicted relationship with the named NPC member, or should have a
hostile history with the faction itself.

# Opposed Factions

Go around the table.  Each player may nominate a faction opposed to the
PCs.  The group should sketch out a leader or point of contact for
that faction, and his relation to the PCs, before proceeding to
nominate the next faction.  This doesn't mean nobody else will show
up, but narrative conservation will ensure these are the most common
antagonists.

For each such faction, one PC should either have a friendly
relationship with the named NPC member, or should have a friendly
history with the faction itself.

# Principal Opposition

Together, decide on one Big Bad---Lo Pan, the Bat Thing, the Grey
Aliens, the Vampire Queen Bianca, the Mind---this can be an
individual, a faction, or a faction with a named proponent as above.

*Note: this part's not well done yet.  It may be best to have
surprises, and I'm not sure how to handle that.*

# Factions not Present

Go around the table.  Each player may nominate a faction *or plot
thread* which will not appear in the game.  For example, those playing
in my games might want to know that Lectroids will not appear, nor
will this turn out to be a game of *Mage: the Ascension*.
