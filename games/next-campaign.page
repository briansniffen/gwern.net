title: What to run next?  Lex off!
description: More thoughts on games
---

My Earthdawn test game is running swimmingly.  But it's always been
declared to be of finite length, running until I can figure out what
works and what doesn't.  I've got a couple of ideas about what to do
next:

 1. Gritty fantasy-adventure.  Might be nominally in the Exalted
    world, but if so it's in a shunted off little corner that looks
    more like the *Black Company* or Bungie's [Myth][].  System is
    likely GURPS, with extensive support for culturally-specific
    systems.  I like what HeroQuest and The Shadow of Yesterday did
    there.  So I'd like to see stock GURPS Magic, Contemplative Magic,
    Unlimited Mana, Ritual, etc. all facing one another.

    I do have some more setting ideas for this one: I know I want a
    river, with an empire in the floodplains.  I know I want the
    emperor to have some sort of contemplative, oracular, enchantress
    corps.  I know I want a split kingdom, with each half claiming to
    have inherited the mantle.  I know I want a city-state satrapy of
    a distant empire.  I know I want a handful of outcast
    downtrodden peoples as sources for heroes: a tribe of brickmakers
    in the river empire, a rough and surly race of barbarians.  I
    don't have a lot more to say about horselords, but I'm not
    particularly opposed to them either.

    I do know I want an almost-all human setting.  If there are
    serpent-men, they're alien and inimical NPCs off in the jungle.  If
    there are elves, they lived and died before the Sun rose on Human
    cities, and their places do not love the tread of younger feet.

    Howard's Conan, Nifft the Lean, Fafrd and the Grey Mouser,
    Asprin's Sanctuary and the Books of Exodus, Judges, and Kings are
    all good sources for this.

 2. Conspiracy Theories II.  I greatly enjoyed running the first
    [Conspiracy Theories][] in the 1998-2000 timeframe.  It had some
    of the worst mechanics I've ever written, but managed to teach me
    a lot about good gaming and leave some excellent stories on the
    table.  I've been thinking about doing this in GURPS, and I've
    been thinking about doing this in Feng Shui.  

    Even if the FS system, it would not be on the default Feng Shui
    setting---though it might look like that at first, I've got some
    fun ideas in mind for who's really behind the Jade Wheel society.
    I'd be inclined to avoid the 4-junctures split, and start the
    characters out *mostly* unaware of the background setting.  They've
    been melodramatically hooked in, but haven't really come to
    understand it yet.  So they may have seen sorcery, but probably
    aren't Sorcerers.  They may be Transformed Animals, but don't know
    what that means besides funny food preferences and powerful kung
    fu.

    My inspirations are mostly Baen authors here: Mutineer's Moon and
    some alternate versions of the Darhel war.

 3. Masks of Nyarlethotep.  I'm told it's one of the best packaged
    modules ever written.  I'd almost certainly run it against Feng
    Shui or Adventure!, since it benefits from a pulpy feel over the
    brooding death of the BRP or d20 *Call of Cthulhu*.

You'll notice GURPS and Feng Shui figure prominently above.  GURPS has
a lot more tactical depth, but Feng Shui has a better universal
mechanic, and appears to scale better.  GURPS 4 fixes a lot of the
problems I had with GURPS 3, too---and I've got a better idea of which
buttons not to push.  Turning on all the combat options turns the game
into Advanced Squad Leader.  You can get a great gritty game with
plenty of tactical meat using the Basic Combat System sometimes, the
Tactical Combat System if the players care, and one or two
setting-specific options.

But which setting to run?  That's hard.  I'm tempted to compromise,
say that one is the cyberspace of the other or something.  Then I
really am back to running [Shadowdawn][]!  By current best thought is
to try fleshing out one or both settings with a game of [lexicon][]
(some variant with slightly looser alphabetics, I think).  By adding
material to the settings, I and potential players can better predict
what'll be more fun.
