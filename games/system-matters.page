title: System Matters, and John Snead
description: This system is broken, get me more of it

From a thread on rpg.net, I begin to see why Exalted has some of the
disconnection it does.  It doesn't make it a bad game, but... well,
look at this quote from John Snead, one of the authors:

Anything this man writes about mechanics or system is going to be
worse than useless to me.  I'll need to excise it from my game, since
it'll be otherwise constantly getting in my way.  I want rules to
mediate and schedule the interesting parts of my game.  If we're
bargaining for influence, make it currency!  If there's tactical
positioning to do, give me a map and some system for movement.

The funny thing is, he's a systems guy.  He wrote a bunch of the magic
rules for *Dying Earth*, and they're fantastic.  They're not the core
of the game---that's snide remarks and [hat design](http://www.dyingearth.com/downloads/DEcharsheet.pdf)---but they're
certainly important to getting the feel right.

I wonder if part of this is due to different definitions of "system".
After all, the most fun part of Shadowrun is the prep and planning.
There's no dice-rolling then, but plenty of IC arguments... backed up
by a rich system of price and availability.  When it starts to get
un-fun, an OOC argument over wise plans, is when I find myself wanting
more system, not less.  By calling on a system agreed upon in
principle beforehand, we resolve a conflict and get back to the fun
part.  I think we'd agree that the latter part is system, but I'm not
sure he'd see the former as system.  He might characterize it as a
very well-established setting.
