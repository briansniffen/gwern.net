description: A one-shot with Dogs in the Vineyard
---

This last Wednesday I ran a one-shot session of [*Dogs in the
Vineyard*](http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/dogs.html).  What
a great game.  The system is interesting in play, and the direct
instructions for game preparation are wonderful.

# System in play

Dogs uses a randomness-first conflict resolution system.  Players
establish stakes, then each roll a giant pool of dice.  Able to see
the others' results, they take turns "raising" with the total of a
pair of dice, then "seeing" with enough pips to equal that total.
When you run out of dice, you lose.  If you can see with few dice,
you're doing well.  If you need many dice to see, you're doing
poorly---not only are you falling behind in the dice economy, but you
also take "Fallout": changes to your character's traits and
relationships, including experience, personal growth, and wounds.

This is a neat tactical minigame.  In a many-sided conflict, it's
interesting to play.  There are definitely tactics to be exploited,
drawing out particular high dice and ensuring you'll be able to see
forthcoming raises with singleton dice.

Because each See and each Raise require narration, there's a nice flow
of interaction in the conflict.  Everybody knows what they can say
when: you can't narrate a finishing move unless you're actually
finishing, but then you know you can.  You know to narrate a weak,
misapplied thrust when raising with a 2, and to narrate a crushing
blow when raising with a 20.

Also, it lets us use all our polyhedral dice.  This is fun.

# Building towns and NPCs

D. Vincent Baker, the author of Dogs, has made several innovations in
gaming.  I hope he's remembered for this one: clear, systematic
instructions to the games-master for how to generate background,
non-player characters, situation, and conflict.  There's an algorithm
and a recipe for creating cool supernatural Westerns here.  You can
see it reflected in my notes: all problems start with Pride.  Pride
leads to an Injustice.  The response to Injustice is Sin.  Sin permits
Demonic Attacks.  Either the victims of the Demonic Attacks or
observers will come to believe False Doctrine, seeking to explain why
some are receiving supernatural punishment and others are not.
Practicing that False Doctrine is Corrupt Worship.  If three or more
do this, one is a False Priest.  Demons obey False Priests, and they
become Sorcerers.  Eventually, the Demons induce them to ritualistic,
senseless Hate and Murder.

The players ran off with this and got involved with the kids before
Amos had a chance to find them, so they never met him or Jeremiah.
Then things were on a roller-coaster, so they didn't find out about
any of this Pride stage until the postgame, after they'd burned down
the church and engaged in a raging gun-battle with the Sorcerer.

Gideon can mean "he that bruises," by the way.  So when the PCs start
noticing weird bruises and hemophilia, it's *possible* for linguist
players to notice this and do something about it.  It's not likely and
in fact it's almost impossible, but the hook is there.

This worked!  I was shocked.  Half the PCs did seem to side with David
& Leah and want to help Gideon, suspecting the Steward.  Half backed
the Steward.  They ended up all on the right side, of course, but I'm
not sure I've ever intentionally gotten that sort of ambiguity
before.  Dogs provided a nice lab environment to play with it.

The urban, civilized players believed the Doctor, who was mostly full
of himself and an Eastern Atheist.  They pretty quickly figured out
that "hemophilia" meant "demon attacks," though.

This really got the players nervous about the Steward.  Apparently the
goal of protecting children from predators is deeply ingrained---they
saw a weird relationship with children, and a fostering system, and
freaked.

Along the way are subprotocols for involving player characters,
ensuring that they will find relatives, foils, and sympathetic folk
among the NPCs.  Taken all together, this is genius.  I want this sort
of support from more of my games!  It means I can prepare for an
adventure and know I'm generating something good.  I've got lots of
room for flexibility, but know I'm staying on-message and in-theme.

I can see descendants of this system in *Weapons of the Gods* and in
*Burning Empires*.
