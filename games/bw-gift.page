title: Burning Wheel: The Gift
---

I ran Burning Wheel last night, using a prepackaged convention
scenario called *The Gift*.  It focuses on conflict arising when an
Elven Prince visits a newly-crowned Dwarven Prince and forgets to
bring an appropriate gift.  It works for up to eight players: each
side gets a Prince, a warrior-advisor, a geeky-advisor, and an
annoying family member.  The Dwarves have a smelly drunken uncle, the
only Dwarf PC not hidebound to tradition.  The Elves get a racist
ranger with the only practical magic in game: he can turn invisible.

We only had five players, and so used the two Princes, the Elven
Sword-Singer Captain Tragic Samurai, the Dwarven Seneschal and Greedy
Bastard, and the Drunkle.

This was partly for the fun of this scenario, but largely for a
shakedown of the Burning Foo mechanics.  We didn't do any character
burning, but did try out skill tests, versus tests, Artha,
advancement, and two of the big minigames, "Duel of Wits" and "Fight!".

It worked quite well.  The basic stat and skill system is great.  It
was clear what skills to roll for any contested tasks.  The mechanism
for benefitting from related skills (FoRKs) is very powerful and frequently
used: people with base skills of 4 were often rolling 7 or 8 dice from
FoRKs and help from others.

The Duel of Wits was very effective at stopping endless posturing:
once players have taken their positions and started to turtle a bit,
this is a way to keep the game moving forwards.  It's hard to play a
character who has a strong opinion, but whose opinion can be changed.
This shows a way to do it.  Also, it's not too complicated.  We
managed to have lots of roleplaying in and among the mechanical
decisions.  It helps that there's a clear spot to say what you do.

Fight! is harder.  There's a lot more going on, what with positioning
and all.  The extra mechanics for damage and wounds don't get in the
way---they're nicely isolated.  Some players took too much time
strategizing and angsting over what to script, but I think that would
fade in time.  Our biggest problem was fitting in narration and
stunts.  I've got to look at the rules again.  It's clear when you
read off your script for the Volley,  then everybody else does, and
then you make your rolls.  It's not clear when in there you shout
about rushing across the field and gutting your opponent.  There's an
[example][] posted on the BW wiki, and it may make this more clear.

The one actual Fight! we had was a semiformal duel between the
princes, except for the bit where one prince went mad with lust for
the mithril armor of the other in the middle.  Being heavily armored,
they both managed to shrug off a lot of blows.  It was clear that they
could dance and nick each other for a long time.  The greater Power
and Forte of the Dwarf came into play---almost any blow he landed
would be lethal to his opponent, while the Elfs blows were only
superficial wounds to the Dwarf.  At one point the Dwarf drew on his
infernal Greed and smashed in the head of the Elf, rolling a truly
ludicrous number of dice and open-ending the 6s with a Fate point.
This would have cut the Elf in half!  The Elf spend one of his very
scarce Deeds points to not be slaughtered.  The Elf landed a number of
blows on the Dwarf, but armor saved him every time.

The armor decay mechanics are clearly absolutely necessary.  Without
those, the Elf could have banged on the Dwarf all night with no
effect.  As it was, the wound-positioning mechanics were interesting:
the Dwarf kept offering different limbs, and the Elf kept nicking the
armor on them down a die or two, or with enough successes
repositioning over to the weakest spot.

I'm left with two things to check: 

 * Do defenses persist?  That is, if Alice scripts "Avoid" and Bob
   scripts "Block, Strike," does Alice get any defense against the
   Strike?  If not, extra attacks from Reflexes are invaluable.

 * When armor falls off, does it do so by location?  Or is that the
   whole suit failing?

Thanks to Ariel, Kat, Andrew, Owen, and Thomas for helping playtest!
This system is good enough to run something long-term in.

**Update**: it looks like defenses don't persist.  Reflexes are king.
  Good thing they're hard to increase, being the floor of the average
  of Perception, Agility, and Speed.  I could see changing that to be
  the *lowest* of those three stats instead.

Also, armor does get damaged by location.  This is good, because it
keeps the wound-placement game interesting.

----
One small note: Armor is very different from Burning Empires; don't
confuse the two!  BW armor is dice rolled such that any successes mean
you don't take a wound, but any 1s mean a die of armor fell off.
