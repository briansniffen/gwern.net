So on Christmas I finally got a [Zeo](!Wikipedia). A Zeo is basically an alarm clock with a wireless scaled-down [EEG](!Wikipedia) sensor-headband. The EEG data is processed to estimate whether one is asleep and what [stage](!Wikipedia "Sleep#Sleep stages") of sleep one is in. Zeo breaks sleep down into waking, [REM](!Wikipedia "Rapid eye movement sleep"), [light](!Wikipedia "Non-rapid eye movement sleep"), and [deep](!Wikipedia "Slow-wave sleep"). (The phases aren't necessarily that physiologically distinct.)

The data is much better than what you would get from more popular methods like cellphones with accelerometers, since an accelerometer only knows if you are moving or not, which isn't a very reliable indicator of sleep. (You could just be lying there staring at the ceiling, wide awake. Or perhaps the cat is kneading you while you are in light sleep.) As well, half the interest is how exactly sleep phases are arranged and how long the cycles are; you could use that information to devise [a custom polyphasic schedule](http://blog.myzeo.com/sleeping-round-the-clock-a-polyphasic-experiment/) or just figure out a better nap length than the rule-of-thumb of 20 minutes.

I personally want the data for a few distinct purposes:

1. quantifying the benefits of [melatonin]()
2. quantifying the benefits of [modafinil]()
3. testing benefits of [huperzine-A](!Wikipedia)
4. designing & starting [polyphasic sleep](!Wikipedia)[^ferriss]
5. assisting [lucid dreaming](!Wikipedia)
6. reducing sleep time in general (better & less sleep)

Christmas morning, I unpacked it and admired the packaging, and then looked through the manual. The base-station/alarm-clock seems pretty sturdy and has a large clear screen. The headband seemed comfortable enough that it wouldn't bother me. The various writings with it seemed rather fluffy and preppy, but I did my technical homework before hand, so could ignore their crap.

Late that night (quite late, since the girls stayed up playing _[Fable 3](!Wikipedia)_ and Xbox [Kinect](!Wikipedia) dancing games and what not), I turn in wearily. I had noticed that the alarm seemed to be set for ~3:30 AM, but I was very tired from the long day and taking my melatonin, and didn't investigate further - I mean, what electronic would ship with the alarm both enabled and enabled for a bizarre time? It wasn't worth bothering the other sleeper by turning on the light and messing with it. I put on the headband, verified that the Zeo seemed to be doing stuff, and turned in.

Come 3 AM, and the damn music goes off! I hit snooze, too discombobulated to figure out how to turn off the alarm.

So that explains the strange Zeo data for the first day:

TODO

The major surprise in this data was how quickly I fell asleep: TODO minutes. I had always thought that I took much longer to fall asleep, more like 45 minutes, and had budgeted accordingly. The rest of the data seemed too messed up by the alarm to learn anything from.

One possible application for Zeo was meditation. If it's measuring via EEG, then presumably it's learning something about how relaxed and activity-less one's mind is. I'm not seeking enlightenment, just calmness, which would seem to be in the purview of an EEG signal. (As Charles Babbage said. errors made using insufficient data are still less than errors made using no data at all.) But alas, I meditated for a solid 25 minutes and the Zeo stubbornly read at the same wake level the entire time; I then read my [Donald Keene](!Wikipedia) book, _Modern Japanese diaries: the Japanese at home and abroad as revealed through their diaries_, for a similar period with no change at all. It is possible that the 5-minute averaging (Zeo measures every 2 seconds) is hiding useful changes, but probably it's simply not picking up any real differences. Oh well!

The second night I had set the alarm to a more reasonable time, and also enabled its smart alarm mode (["SmartWake"](http://blog.myzeo.com/smartwake-a-different-way-to-wake-up/)), where the alarm will go off up to 30 minutes early if you are ever detected to be awake or in light sleep (as opposed to REM or deep sleep). One thing I forgot to do was take my melatonin; I keep my supplements in the car and there was a howling blizzard outside. It didn't bother me since I am not addicted to melatonin.

In the morning, the smart alarm mode seemed to work pretty well. I woke up early in a good mode, thought clearly and calmly about the situation - and went back to sleep. (It's a holiday, after all.)

The data looked much better than the first night, except for a big 2-hour gap where I vaguely recall the sensor headband having slipped off. (I don't think it was because it was uncomfortable but due to shifting positions or something.) Judging from the cycle of sleep phases, I think I lost data on a REM peak. The REM peaks interest me because it's a standard theory of polyphasic sleeping that thriving on 2 or 3 hours of sleep a day is possible because REM is the only phase that truly matters, and REM can dominate sleep time through [REM rebound](!Wikipedia) and training.

TODO

Besides that, I noticed that time to sleep was TODO minutes that night. Perhaps the excess time was thanks to the lack of melatonin. Since I've begun this inadvertent experiment, I'll try continuing it, alternating days of melatonin usage. I claim in my melatonin article that usage seems to save about 1 hour of sleep/time, but there's several possible avenues. One could be quicker to fall asleep; one could awake fewer times; and one could have greater percentage of REM or deep sleep, reducing light sleep. (Light sleep doesn't seem very useful; I sometimes feel worse after light sleep.)

During the afternoon, I took a quick nap. I'm not a very good napper, it seems - only the first 5 minutes registered as even light sleep.

A dose of melatonin (1.5mg) and off to bed a bit early. I'm a little more impressed with the smart alarm; since I'm hard-of-hearing and audio alarms rarely if ever work, I usually use a wakemate TODO vibrating alarm clock. But in the morning I woke up within a minute of the alarm, despite the lack of vibration or flashing lights. The data was especially good today, with no big gaps:

TODO

You can see an impressively regular sleep cycle, cycling between REM and light sleep. What's disturbing is the relative lack of deep sleep. I suspect that the lack of deep sleep indicates I wasn't sleeping very well, but not badly enough to wake up, and this is probably due either to light from the Zeo itself or my lack of regular blankets and use of a sleeping bag. But the awakenings around 4-6 AM and on other days has made me suspicious that one of the cats is bothering me around here and I'm just forgetting it as I fall asleep.

The next night is another no-melatonin night. This time it took 79 minutes to fall asleep. Very bad, but far from unprecedented; this sort of thing is why I was interested in melatonin in the first place. Deep sleep is again conspicuously absent, with a block at the beginning and end, but mostly a regular cycle between light and REM:

TODO

Melatonin night, and 32 minutes to sleep. (I'm starting to notice a trend here.) Another fairly regular cycle of phases, with some deep sleep at the beginning and end:

TODO

Perhaps I should try a biphasic schedule where I sleep for an hour at the beginning and end? That'd seem to pick up most of my deep sleep, and REM would hopefully take care of itself with REM rebound. Need to sum my average REM & deep sleep times (that sum seems to differ quite a bit, eg one fellow needs [4+ hours](http://blog.myzeo.com/forum/polyphasic-sleep-experiment-discussion/rem-deep-sleep/#p627). My own need seems to be similar) so I don't try to pick a schedule doomed to fail.

Another night, no melatonin. Time to sleep, just 19 minutes and the ZQ sets a new record even though Stormy the cat woke me up in the morning:

TODO

I personally blame this on being exhausted from 10 hours working on my transcription of [_The Notenki Memoirs_](docs/2002-notenki-memoirs). But a datapoint is a datapoint.

I spend New Year's Eve pretty much finishing _The Notenki Memoirs_ (transcribing the last of the biographies, the roundtable discussion, and editing the images for inclusion), which exhausts me a fair bit as well; the champagne doesn't help, but between that and the melatonin, I fall asleep in a record-setting 9 minutes. Unfortunately, the headband came off somewhere around 5 AM:

TODO

A cat? Waking up? Dunno.

Another quick falling asleep night at TODO minutes. Which then gets screwed up as I simply can't stay asleep and then the cat begins bothering the heck out of me in the early morning:

TODO

Melatonin night, which subjectively didn't go too badly; 20 minutes to sleep. But lots of wake time (long enough wakes that I remembered them) and 2 or 3 hours not recorded (probably from adjusting my scarf and th headband):

TODO

Accidentally did another melatonin night (thought Monday was a no-melatonin night). Very good sleep - set records for REM especially towards the late morning which is curious. (The dreams were also very curious. I was an Evangelion character (Kaworu) tasked with riding a carnival-like ride that goes up and drops straight down.) Also another quick falling asleep:

TODO

Rather than 3 melatonin nights in a row, I skipped melatonin this night (and thus will have it the next one). Perhaps because I went to sleep so very late, and despite some awakenings, this was a record-setting night for ZQ and TODO deep sleep or REM sleep? :

TODO

I also switched the alarm sounds 2 or 3 days ago to 'forest' sounds; they seem somewhat more pleasant than the beeping musical tones.

[^ferriss]: I had previously [tried](Nootropics#huperzine-a) huperzine-A and found no effect from it, but I had no way of really noticing any effect on sleep, and [Timothy Ferriss](!Wikipedia) in his _The Four-hour Body_ claims:

    > "Taking 200 milligrams of huperzine-A 30 minutes before bed can increase total REM by 20 –30%. Huperzine-A, an extract of _Huperzia serrata_, slows the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is a popular nootropic (smart drug), and I have used it in the past to accelerate learning and increase the incidence of lucid dreaming. I now only use huperzine-A for the first few weeks of language acquisition, and no more than three days per week to avoid side effects. Ironically, one documented side effect of overuse is insomnia. The brain is a sensitive instrument, and while generally well tolerated, this drug is contraindicated with some classes of medications. Speak with your doctor before using."
