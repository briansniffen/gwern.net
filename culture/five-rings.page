title: Book of Five Rings, by Musashi Miyamoto
description: Age quod ageris.
---

"The warrior should not have a favorite weapon."  This book's been
represented to me several times as a good complement to *Art of War*.
That's a somewhat misleading characterization.  Musashi's approach to
strategy is through swordsmanship: to fight with an army of ten
thousand as you fight with two swords.  But though he has much to say
about the spirit and principles of a warrior, he leaves blank most of
the larger canvas.  Certainly, his core precepts are worth
remembering:

 * The warrior should not have a favorite weapon.

 * The spirit of his art is to win.

 * The spirit of fighting is to cut the other man.

 * Study the techniques of others, across all strata of society.  Then
   do your own job well.

I think I would have gotten much more out of this if I knew more of
sword-fighting; even so, there was much to learn even from the most
sword-focused chapters.
