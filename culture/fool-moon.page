Werewolves!  Loup-garou!  And a talking skull named Bob!  Gosh, this
series makes me want to break out [Ars
Magica](http://www.atlas-games.com/arsmagica/index.php) (Hey, ArsM4 is
free!) and a map of Chicago.  Most of the relationship exploration
focuses on Dresden's cop buddy, Karrin Murphy.  So far, this has felt
like the weakest book of the series---though I may just be
disappointed that it introduced less interesting world features than
*Storm Front* or *Grave Peril* (or for that matter *Summer Knight*).

Books read this year: 37
