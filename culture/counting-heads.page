title: Counting Heads, by David Marusek
description: Episodic fiction is less fun.
---

This is the first full-length novel by an established author of short
stories and novellas.  Its first section is a previously-published
novella; the rest of the book follows those characters and their
descendants across several generations.  It's a mid-singularity novel:
things have changed, but not so much that we can't follow the
humanity.  The changes are no more than those between the eighteenth
and twentieth centuries.

The AIs are reminiscent of John Wright's sophotechs: a similar degree
of humor and emphasized self-awareness.  The complex overlays of
valet, mentar, and NASTIE lead to interesting social results.  Perhaps
the coolest tech mentioned is an artificial "metalanguage" Starkese, a
style of speaking used for identification and very sensitive business.

Like Vinge, Stross, and others, Marusek introduces a vast array of
characters and weaves them towards each other in the final pages of
the novel.  Unlike Vinge and Stross, his threads miss!  The ending
leaves the core emotional issues of the characters unresolved.  Based
on that, I'd be less likely to read further long fiction by Marusek,
and wouldn't recommend him---though I should go check out *Wedding
Album*, his most famous short story.

It turns out that this is [what the author intended][blog]: this is one volume
of a many-volume episodic work, no more intended to stand on its own
than *Eye of the World*.  If he hadn't mentioned this in his [blog][],
I doubt I've had noticed or bothered with him.  Tor needs better
marketing for books like this---not to mention better editing for
books like [*Instrumentalities of the Night*][night].
