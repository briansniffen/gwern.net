title: Divided Alleigiance, by Elizabeth Moon
description: It's worth it to get to *Oath of Gold*.
---

This is the second book of *The Deed of Paksenarrion*.  It departs
from the [first][] in its tone just as Paks departs from her beloved
Company.  The structure is very similar to the first---she leaves her
home and comfortable backgroung to seek something new.  The plot is
much more similar to a D&D adventure: she teams up with some elf just
because he's the other PC, goes dungeon delving because it's there,
and spends much of her time griping about the railroaded plot.  As
novelized D&D games go, this is top-notch.  Moon's aware of the
conventions of the sub-genre, writing years after Weis and Hickman,
and does very well with them.  Some are honored, others intentionally
overthrown.

I was warned that this isn't as good as *Sheepfarmer's Daughter*.  It's
not.  It is worth it to get to *Oath of Gold*, though.
