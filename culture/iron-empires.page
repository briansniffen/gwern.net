title: Faith Conquers and Sheva's War, by Christopher Moeller
description: Comic books with space marines
---

This is a first: a game so good it got me to get the books it's based
on.  And they're graphic novels at that!  These are collections of
serial comics written and painted by Christopher Moeller.  The general
feel is somewhere between Traveller and Warhammer 40K: There was a
great world here, and the people enjoying it grew lax and dropped it.
Now the flame grows red and gutters.

The world presented is deep and attractive.  Moeller learned from
Herbert, Tolkien, and Asimov, it's clear: he presents his world with
excellent skill and subtlety.  He never tells you what a Cotar Fomas
is, or the details of the faith of the Wheel, but it's clear by a
chapter into *Faith Conquers*.

The characters are painted well enough that I think I'd recognize them
on the street, and given enough depth that I know which I'd like
to---and in which moods.  The plots are those of short stories:
there's no space in this medium for the craft Gene Wolfe takes 750
pages to execute.  I'd love to see novel-length works by this author,
but I don't think I have the shelf space to contain that with
ubiquitous paintings.
