 22. Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, Cory Doctorow

 23. Waterborn, J. Gregory Keyes

 24. Blackgod, J. Gregory Keyes

 25. Look to Windward, Iain M. Banks.  It's funny how the first chapter
     of a Culture book always turns me off, but the book after that is
     wonderful.  At least now I know to bull onwards.

 26. Adventures in Unhistory, Avram Davidson

 27. The TeXBook, Donald Knuth

 28. Exalted: Year One, various White Wolf

 29. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Joanne Rowling

 30. Unknown Quantity, a Real and Imaginary History of Algebra, John
     Derbyshire

 31. On the Origin of PCs, Order of the Stick 0, Rich Burlew

 32. Start of Darkness, Order of the Stick -1, Rich Burlew

 33. Transparent Society, David Brin.  Flung it across the room four
     times by chapter 4, went somewhat lightly over the rest.  Feels
     like a good essay rushed into a book.

 34. Stardust, Being a Romance within the Realms of Faerie, Neil Gaiman
     and Charles Vess.  I have no understanding of the relationship
     between this, the original comic books, and the novel.  If there
     are substantial differences, I might enjoy those others.

 35. Magic in the Ancient World, Fritz Graf.  This is I think
     translated from a German thesis.  Lots of lead tablets, and a
     nice discussion of the distinction between evidenced sorcery and
     the literary tradition of sorcery.  It's a bit on the post-modern
     side: most of its discussion of how one becomes a sorcerer
     confuses what the sorcerers thought they were doing with their
     marginalization by society.  In Graf's discussion, there is no
     difference between a real magician, a deluded wannabe magician,
     and a man accused by his society of magic.  He doesn't argue for
     that point, just assumes it in many passages.

 36. Thief of Time, Pratchett

 37. Empire of Honor, J.E. Lendon

 38. [Great Work of Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Work_of_Time), John Crowley

 39. Journey to the West, Volume I, translated by Anthony Yu---the
     first 25 chapters of this enormous work.

 40. Halting State, Charles Stross.  Pity about the core scifi bit,
     which is that Quantum Key Exchange counters Quantum
     Computing---at least if it's over Secure Optical Fiber.  Also, QC
     is apparently really good for symmetric ciphers, and shared
     "one"-time pads are used for group authentication.  Maybe this is
     how rocket scientists feel when they watch Star Wars, and I
     should be glad that my field's prominent enough to be mauled in
     this way.  The problems didn't detract from the enjoyment of the
     story at all---I just substituted "magic" for "quantum" wherever
     I read it and continued.  It's a wonderful fun technothriller.

 41. Android's Dream, John Scalzi

 42. Swordspoint, Ellen Kushner.  In a nice 2002 edition with a set of
     short stories attached.  Now I can't tell whether Fall of the
     Kings is a sequel or not.

 43. Supercapitalism, Robert Reich.

 4. Fire in the Mist, Holly Lisle
