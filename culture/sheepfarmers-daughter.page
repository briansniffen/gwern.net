title: Sheepfarmer's Daughter, by Elizabeth Moon
---

This is the first book of *The Deed of Paksenarrion*.  It makes a
wonderful complement to *Black Company* for me: a view of a mercenary
company from a grunt's-eye view, rather than the captain and his
immortal sorceress lover.  The jacket cover gives the impression that
Moon has some personal experience with the social issues here.  Paks
herself is very clearly not a John Ringo character: she isn't the
first up in the morning, she doesn't magically know about inspections
ahead of time, she isn't obviously a squad leader in training, and
when she has doubts about her place in the military, the sergeant
can't easily dismiss them.
