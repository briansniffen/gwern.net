title: Tyranny of the Night, by Glen Cook
description: The worst book I read in 2006.
---

This is the worst book I've read this year.  The editing is simply
atrocious.  It reminds me in some ways of the early Black Company
books, the Annals as written by Croaker.  Like those, there's a rough
introduction to a new world through the eyes of one very familiar with
it.  Like Croaker, the narrator here is leaving out mountains of data
that might incriminate him.

And like those early books, I have a heck of a time figuring out all
of what's going on.  If you focus on the character, you're OK.  If you
know enough of the history to realize correspondences (Deves are Jews,
Pramas are Muslims, Peter is Gustav?, the Andorans are Norsemen,
Brothe is Rome and I think Draenger is Andalusia), you can do OK---if
not, they're just random fantasy place-names.  If you don't have a
sense of the sweep of the second millennium in Europe, a whole bunch
of the history happening next to this book is going to be unreadably
confusing.

At some point, a more dedicated fan than I will publish a dictionary
mapping Cook's terms to the real ones.  I'm still not sure who the
Dainshau are.  Zoroastrians?  Very early Druze?  Until then, I think
anyone can read it if he focuses on the characters and not the sweep
of history.  This will become more clear when the sequels appear.
Until then, I suspect that I'd have enjoyed the book more if they just
stuck to real names for most things, using fantastic names only for
fantastic entities.

This is one more element of troublingly bad editing at Tor Books.
Maybe it's intentional---maybe this is part of this narrator's voice.
Maybe it's just the sloppiness of a new editor working with a revered
master-author.  I'm not inside Tor, so I don't know why or how this
happened.  I do know that many of the sentences are incomplete, a
number use the *wrong* made-up fantasy analogue-name, and a few are
quite hard to understand.

Approach this book with caution.
