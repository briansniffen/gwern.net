I enjoyed the Prydain books as a child, but I didn't love them.  They
didn't feel like stories.  They were confusing and muddled, more like
real things than the things of fantasy.  Eilonwy didn't feel like a
fictional character, but like a girl I'd known a year or so in the
past---always a year or so, just long enough for memories to be muted
and the events of the books remain.  Looking back, that's quite a
compliment.  I haven't read the Prydain books in years, but I remember
the language as challenging a ten-year-old the way Gene Wolfe
challenges me now.

*Time Cat*, on the other hand, was wonderful.  It's a simple
collection of short stories about a boy and his cat, a half-dozen
history lessons in a few hundred pages.  But those depictions of
Leonardo, Sucat/Patrick, and the Manxmen are still the foundation of
my images of them.

[Lloyd Alexander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Alexander) passed
away today, surviving his wife of 62 years by only two weeks.  He
served in the U.S. Army during the second World War.

And as his wisdom passes from the world, Alexander leaves us with hope
for his last
[novel](http://www.amazon.com/Golden-Dream-Carlo-Chuchio/dp/0805083332),
to be published this fall.^[And indeed, it was wonderful.]

Mr. Alexander, thank you for bringing
[color](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fflewddur_Fflam) to the facts
that need it so badly.
