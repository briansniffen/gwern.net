I like this definition of [hard
fantasy](http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2007/05/fantasys_apocal_1.html).
I haven't read most of the authors he names---Martin, obviously, and
some Keyes but not *that* Keyes.  I keep meaning to get to Erikson's
*Malazan Book of the Fallen*, but the first one's out of the
library... again.
