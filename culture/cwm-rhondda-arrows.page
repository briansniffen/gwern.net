John Hughes is truly amazing.  First, he wrote the tune
[Cwm Rhondda](http://www.walesonline.com/cds/rhondda.mid)
This is the backbone for a number of classic hymns, including "Guide
me ever great redeemer" and "God of grace and God of glory."  It's a
wonderfully evocative tune.

Beyond that, he wrote and directed most of the 80s: Home Alone,
Beethoven, Uncle Buck, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller, Breakfast Club,
Sixteen Candles, and the National Lampoon movies.

And if that weren't enough, he's the author of a nice structuring idea
for computation, called [Arrows](http://www.haskell.org/arrows/).  His
[paper](http://www.haskell.org/arrows/biblio.html#Hug00) setting out
these ideas is very nice, though the [later
tutorial](http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/afp-arrows.pdf) is probably
a better start.
