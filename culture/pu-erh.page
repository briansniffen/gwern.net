title: Pu-erh tea
description: Dwarf tea

I'd been warned about Pu-erh.  I'd been told to try samples: not for
everyone, post-fermented, the kimchi of teas.  I expected something
vinegary, a sort of pickled tea.  That's not what this is like at
all.  Perhaps it's dwarf tea---a tea for drinking under mountains, or
for drinking like you're under a mountain.  Earthy, rich, but smooth.
Darn good tea.
