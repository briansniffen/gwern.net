title: Operation Condor: Armor of God II: Operation Condor II: Armor of the Gods
description: Jackie Chan is worth watching anyway.
---

Jackie Chan is a tricky, tricky man.  We just finished watching
*Operation Condor 2: The Armour of the Gods*.  It had far less Nazi
gold than I'd remembered.  Turns out I was remembering *Armour of God
II: Operation Condor*.  Whoops.  They're even closely titled in the
original.  Can **you** tell [Fei ying gai wak][] from
[Long xiong hu di][]?  Me neither.  We watched the latter.  The former
has the Nazis, the wind tunnel, and the gold.  The latter has monks
and Miss Spain 1979.

If you think that's bad, check out how many other "Operation Condor"
movies are listed by [IMDB][].
