Kat and I saw *The Prestige* last night.  Some spoiler-free thoughts:
This is a movie about bad people doing terrible things to themselves,
each other, and everybody nearby.  My family and I came out with very
clear, distinct, and different ideas about who were justified and
righteous.  This may have something to do with the differences in when
we picked up on what was going on: those who saw some of the Keyser
S&ouml;ze moments coming tended to think better of the characters
involved, whereas those who were shocked tended to react harshly.

The editors did excellent work.  Some bits, especially during and
right after the title sequence, came out rough.

But here's the big issues for me: did Michael Caine know that
Christian Bale was going to shoot Hugh Jackman?  If so, why didn't he
stop the shooting?  For that matter, why didn't he stop Christian Bale
from being hanged for a murder he didn't commit?  Kat's suspicion is
that this was to avenge the murder of Julia McCullough, which Caine
knows Bale did commit.  But it still leaves Caine as a heartless
bastard, in with the other heartless bastards.

Why kill your instances?  If you're rich, why not divide up your
fortune amongst yourselves and go out to do things on your own?  I
understand that Priest/Nolan wanted to establish the differences
between the natural twins of Bale and the unnatural instances of
Jackman, but that broke psychological reality for me, and with it some
suspension of disbelief.

On the subject of unreality: What about generation decay?  OK, OK, it
makes no sense to ask this while leaving the conservation problems
untouched.

Beyond that, did Hugh Jackman leave another instance?  Since he was so
methodical about killing most of them, probably not.
