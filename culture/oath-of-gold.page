title: Oath of Gold, by Elizabeth Moon
description: Paladins don't have to be stupid.
---

This is the third and last book of *The Deed of Paksenarrion*.  It's
revealed that Paks has been crushed and driven into the dirt just to
show how strong-willed and awesome she is in climbing out.  She
doesn't just have talent and barbarian strength---she can make it
without those.  She isn't just a Paladin chosen by the church---God
picked her out personally and she can make it without the church, even
over their opposition.  It's a nicely resonant ending to the trilogy.
*Sheepfarmer's Daughter* stands alone, but this book justifies
*Divided Alleigiance*.
