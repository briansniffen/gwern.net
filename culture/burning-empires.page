title: Burning Empires, by Luke Crane
---

I've written about this elsewhere already.  That was written when I'd
read enough to absorb the material.  This is written after I've given
it a thorough, front-to-back reading.  As with other indie games
(e.g., Weapons of the Gods), *Burning Empires* is best read straight
through.  There's a lot of specialized terminology here, and a lot of
attention given to the method of instruction.

Further, the game described is very different from traditional RPGs
like D&D or GURPS.  Those who forget this will learn the middle
chapters on top of a falsely assumed basis.  Like reading about
helicopter controls while imagining a jetski as the base vehicle, they
are likely to doubt the quality and sanity of the work.

This is a gaming book.  It's a book about a game.  Once you've read
the book, you can play the game.  It's closer to being a prepackaged
game than almost anything else I've read in the genre---right up there
with Mountain Witch and D&D 3.5 for ease of use.  

Those two provide further use as endpoints of the spectrum of
mechanical complexity: unlike Mountain Witch, this is a game with
skill and trait lists.  It has stats, dice pools, and tactics to be
employed in their selection and use.  As the author said, it is a
"technical game."  Like Risk or Cosmic Encounters, it is best enjoyed
by those willing to use many points of contact with its mechanics,
distributed across its surface.  

I've spoken of other features of the game before.  Let me here
concentrate on its features as a technical book: how it communicates
the setting and the mechanics.  This author has a different sense of
language than I do.  The book is dense with jargon, peppered with
symbols and referents.  Each is explained, often multiple times, and
there is an excellent index---but it makes it hard to flip in and
browse.  This rewards reading the book from the front, which teaches
you basic terminology and explains that the book is divided into Hub,
Spokes, and Rim.  Everybody should read the Hub, which explains basic
gaming techniques and systems.  Spokes are pick-and-choose: the
detailed firefight mechanics, magic powers, aliens.  The Rim is
ancillary material.

The setting is not in a separate book or chapter.  Instead, it is
worked deeply into the mechanics.  Nothing straight-out says that the
Hammer naval troops have little respect for the Anvil infantry, but
there's no way into the navy lifepaths without picking up the "Hammer
Flies, Anvil Dies" character trait.  Nothing says the psychic academy
scorns non-nobles, but there are different entry lifepaths into the
psychic setting depending on whether you already have a "Mark of
Privilege" trait.  Soldiers get a trait [FUGAZI][], with no further
explanation.  I had to look it up.

There are some flaws: the Tech Burner makes some differences in
mechanics between burning and play unclear.  The rationale for so many
decisions is explained that a few unexplained features stand
out---most particularly the lack of connection between gameplay and
the Infection strategy game.

Overall, it's a darn good game.  The indie sector of the market is
growing up.  Like Weapons of the Gods, this is a game to attract
normal tabletop players and show them a world beyond
WotC/WW/SJG/Palladium.  Further, with work like this coming out,
there's no excuse for the travesty of the recent Serenity game.
