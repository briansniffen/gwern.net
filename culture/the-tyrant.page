title: The Tyrant, by Eric Flint and David Drake
description: I'd like to be Sulla when I grow up
---

I read this book through the [Baen Free Library][baen].  I had no idea
that it was a distant sequel to a seven-book series; as far as I could
tell, it stood alone with ideas similar to that of the same authors
*Belisarius* books.  It's a fun read, and works well on the tiny
screen of my preferred [reader][treo].

As to the plot?  It's Baen.  We can tell these soldiers are good,
moral men because they built fortifications every night.  We can tell
this is a Virtuous Roman because he liberates the women in his life,
who become strong warrior maids.  This is brain candy---as sweet to a
fan of old Rome as Mercedes Lackey is to a 14-year-old.  I do like
this brain candy, though.  It's nice to imagine how Rome might have
fared if Caesar had the benefit of an omniscient battle computer.

My biggest disappointment with this book is that they never answer the
larger question: did the Republic have to fall?  In an age of
corruption and tyrants, *must* good men abandon even representative
democracy and appoint a Tyrant?  Or, if you have an omniscient battle
computer and Raj Whitehall, can you do any better?
