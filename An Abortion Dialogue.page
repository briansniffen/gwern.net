_[Contrarian knocks on the door. Apologist answers.]_

`Contrarian:` Greetings! Might I ask whether you've an opinion on abortion?

`Apologist:` As it happens, I've thought about the issue a little.

`C:` My friend, the situation hardly bears thinking on; this holocaust demands our action! Accept abortion is evil and institutionalized murder of humanity, and let's discuss what we can do about it.

`A:` Now hold on - I never said I thought abortion is a bad thing. On first glance, it looks pretty good: it's an aid to family planning, compensating for imperfect birth control; it reduces the problem of population growth; it can save the lives of women, and so on. Besides the risks inherent to a major medical procedure, what's so bad about it?

`C:` I already said what was so bad - millions of humans have been killed by abortion! The sum is now far past anything the Nazis dreamed of; as we allow time to pass with this horrific practice uncurbed, even Stalin and Mao's body-counts will be overshadowed. Abortion is nothing but clinicalized murder of a human being!

`A:` But are they?

`C:` Are who what?

`A:` Fetuses, I mean. Are they really human beings?

`C:` Of course they are. 2 cells from 2 humans unite inside a woman, they swell and grow, they come out of that human, they are called a human, live a human life, and eventually die still a human. When exactly would they not be a human?

`A:` Well, when I look at a fetus in its 1^st^ trimester, I don't see much 'human' there. I see a blob of cells, looking like a generally mammalian fetus. It doesn't think, it doesn't feel - it doesn't do anything I recognize as uniquely human. Heck, it 'does' so little that it can't exist except as a parasite on the woman, and even as a parasite, it's pretty pathetic. A tapeworm would look down on it for being an incompetent parasite.

`C:` It may be a blob of cells, but it's a blob of cells with human DNA, from and inside a human. That's what makes a world of difference compared with  a tapeworm.

`A:` I'm not sure we can equate being human as having the same DNA as other humans. What about a tumor? Each tumor has human DNA, is inside a human and of that human, and so as far as I can see is just as human as your fetus. For that matter, tumors can weigh dozens of pounds - does that mean a giant tumor is more human than a fetus which weighs no more than 10 pounds? If so, then I guess your claims about a holocaust are correct, but too low by billions!

`C:` Cancers arise of genetic *mutations*, do they not?

`A:` That's no good: some cancers are hereditary. Besides if just 1 or 2 genetic changes suffice to render something nonhuman, then doesn't gene therapy become murder?

`C:` That's well-said, but I have to deny the analogy. It's true that tumors are made of cells with human DNA, but they're no more human than an _E. Coli_ in my gut which swaps for some human DNA with another, or a gorilla or chimpanzee who both have more than 90% of our DNA, or for that matter, rice and bananas with around 50%. No, the key attribute you're missing is the *potential*. A fetus has potential to grow into something we both accept as human. No matter how many _E. Coli_ you culture or tumors suffer to grow, you'll never see one turn into a human being. They don't have the potential.

`A:` So what would be your definition? Something is human if it's obviously a human being like you or me, or if it has human DNA and is going to become a human in the future?

`C:` Fair enough.

`A:` But fetuses still aren't human. *Most* fetuses wind up being shed with the uterus's lining, or just dying, or are so damaged they never come to term. There's a chance they'll become human, but the cumulative odds are low. Mother Nature is the greatest abortionist of all. TODO: this is probably surprising to most people, so I need to find a citation for the rate of natural abortions.

`C:` Many things in life are low odds. Let's just say 'is possible for it to become a human being'. That sounds reasonable to me. If you accept that, then you must condemn abortion!

`A:` I can't be so enthusiastic. Let me offer a thought-experiment. Suppose we take a woman from her suburban existence. Let's call her Sherry Tiavo. We anesthetize Sherry, crack open her skull, and scoop until all that's left is her spinal cord and brain stem. To be certain, we toss everything into the incinerator. Is Sherry (or her body) still human? Are we guilty of murder?

`C:` Well... the mind is irretrievably gone. You can't regrow a brain. But people would still react to her as a human being - the issue is obvious to them - so I would say yes to both.

`A:` Suppose we then hired a mad cosmetic surgeon to transform her body into something nonhuman. Perhaps a humanoid cat. Now if they happened to come across it, her own family would no longer recognize her as human. Certainly they would not recognize her as their Sherry. What then?

`C:` I know the answer you expect - 'No, since nobody treats her as human, and she has no future potential.'

`A:` Since the body is no longer human, but something 'lower', something animal at best, surely it follows we can do anything to it that we could do to an animal. We could kill it, butcher it, conduct experiments on it, abandon it in the woods...

`C:` Stop, stop! Alright, maybe the obvious-and-potential criterion isn't acceptable after all.

`A:` Well, how do you suggest we modify it? You can't abandon the potentiality criterion without also abandoning fetuses, remember.

`C:` Then I'll drop the 'obvious' criterion. It was wrong of me to accept that in the first place: this very discussion is proof that what is human is apparently not obvious! This criterion covers adults (as obviously one has the potential to become human if one already is human), and fetuses, but excludes tumors and chimeric bacteria.

`A:` I am not normally a disagreeable person, but there must be something in the air today. Abandoning the appeal to social judgment as part of your personhood criteria seems to me to be quite as wrong as affirming it.

`C:` A strong claim. May I ask for an example of how 'potential' on its own could go so astray?

`A:` Certainly. But I have some preliminary points. Now, you accept that on the level of individual cells and such-like, everything is determined by physical laws and starting conditions, yes?

`C:` Yes.

`A:` By which I mean, an embryo or zygote (which grow into the fetus) is an extremely complex agglomeration of chemicals or atoms in a particular arrangement. If I were to manufacture another such agglomeration, identical down to the molecular level, what I would get is a zygote or embryo which is very similar (if not identical) to the original?

`C:` Yes. No doubt there would be differences as the cells grew, ways in which the imperfect replication interacted with the varying conditions to produce varying results. If you were not artful enough, the agglomeration might not even be alive.

`A:` But if I were, it would grow and develop?

`C:` Yes. I am no Luddite who believes in an _Ã©lan vital_ or quantum magic or some such foolishness. You put the right ingredients in the right order, and you get life. It's that simple. Why, we can synthesize simple living cells from scratch in laboratories! TODO link Craig Ventor's work Synthesizing a fertilized human egg differs only in being much more difficult. It is doable in principle.

`A:` But do you suppose it would be more or less difficult to turn a human skin cell into a fertilized egg than to synthesize one from scratch?

`C:` Less, I should think. The skin cell will have pre-constructed many of the necessary constituents; one wouldn't have to construct all the common cellular structures like [mitochondria](!Wikipedia) or the [cellular membrane](!Wikipedia) and [cytoskeleton](!Wikipedia). I believe I have read about skin cells which were made to become [stem cells](!Wikipedia) TODO look up adult cells induced to pluripotency, and I understand stem cells can be made into any kind of cell. We can even convert skin cells to heart cells without converting to stem cells first!^[["Adult Skin Cells Converted Directly to Beating Heart Cells"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110130213901.htm), _Science Daily_.]

`A:` Which finally brings me to my point: isn't it true that any cell in the body has the 'potential' to become a human? Even the lowly skin cell, shed after just 2 weeks, can aspire to personhood if placed in the right broth of chemicals.

`C:` To convert a skin cell to a zygote and grow it - that's some broth.

`A:` But it can be done![^mice]

     And don't your fetuses need a finely calculated broth as well? Remember that most fetuses never become babies, after all. But to continue: you only mentioned possibility. Your possibility grants personhood to every cell of the body. I don't think Walt Whitman meant 'I contain multitudes' quite that way!

`C:` That's a really contrived example. 'Possibility' in ordinary language doesn't include astronomically small odds. If even 1 cell were to be raised in the extraordinary manner you propose, that would be just 1 lucky cell out of literally quadrillions^[Each human contains trillions of cells, and estimates of total human population are over 100 billion.] of human cells to have ever existed.

`A:` I have another objection, then. No doubt you've prepared a slippery slope argument for me: if humanity does not begin at a sharply defined moment such as conception or implantation, then where? At birth? The 2nd trimester? The 3rd? etc.

`C:` I was merely waiting for an opportune moment.

`A:` But I think the slope applies to any idea like yours of humanity as a binary proposition (and not, say, a continuum).

`C:` How so? My position seems quite safe: humanity begins at fertilization, the moment of conception. Unless you mean to say the exact femtosecond the DNA atoms unite is important?

`A:` No. But have you ever heard of [parthenogenesis](!Wikipedia)?

`C:` Yes.

`A:` In parthenogenesis, there is no conception or fertilization. An egg just starts dividing for no particular reason. Perhaps it will divide once, perhaps twice. Perhaps the 2 new cells will never do anything more. And so it wends its uncertain way to becoming an embryo. Now, suppose this happens in a human woman, as seems possible? Where does the humanity of the resultant fetus start? The instant an egg divided? But that would seem to imply all the eggs which divide are humans who are then instantly aborted. When the division starts? Or finishes? Or the second division? But why not then the third or fourth or fifth?

`C:` I could not say. But because I am ignorant of something is not a proof of its nonexistence. Consider [the ship of the Argonauts](!Wikipedia "The Ship of Theseus") TODO check ln. As it sails from port to port, first the sails are replaced, then the riggings; in another, they reap a bargain on navigational gear; in another, they are given a spare rudder; in a fifth place, a storm forces them ashore to replace the planks of the hull, and a bad run-in with a reef necessitates replacement of the keel itself. On their return to Athens, Theseus asks his insurer to lower the premium since it is now a new ship though it bears the name of the old. Would you have the insurer charge Theseus old rates for new ships since Theseus can't tell the insurer the exact repair or second the ship ceased to be old and became new?

`A:` No, but your example doesn't help your case. The insurer should set a new rate because the ship now performs like new. It has fresher less-worn parts, all the latest improvements and gear, and so on. It is less likely to sink than when it left, and that's all that should matter to the insurer. If it acts like a new ship, then oughtn't we to pragmatically treat it like a new ship?

    I see people as being like the ship, and insuring the ship at a lower rate is like classifying as human. If they can act all the acts, think all the thoughts, and feel all the feelings people can, then I will treat them the same.

`C:` Then you would insure even a computer!

_[Apologist shrugs.]_

`A:` If it quacks like a duck...

`C:` I see there is no convincing you. I am sorry for't. I shall continue believing that there is some essence about being human, and you shall continue in your psychological stance that human is as human does. Good day.

_[Contrarian sighs and leaves dejectedly.]_

[^mice]: There has been research on just this topic: taking mouse skin cells, turning them into embryonic stem cells, and then into viable embryos.
    Admittedly, this breakthrough research is from China, and is difficult to replicate else due to ethics guidelines; so there is a nontrivial chance this will turn out to be overstated or fraud, like some of the major Korean cloning results. But even if it has not actually been done, the point is that it is most certainly possible, and may well be a useful technique!
    See _[The Wall Street Journal](!Wikipedia)_'s 27 July 2009 ["Chinese Scientists Reprogram Cells to Create Mice "](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124839803784477915.html):

     > "Two teams of Chinese researchers working separately have reprogrammed mature skin cells of mice to an embryonic-like state and used the resulting cells to create live mouse offspring...
     >
     > Reprogramming has become the hottest area of stem-cell science. For more than two years, scientists have been reprogramming mature mouse- and human-skin cells and returning them to a primordial, embryonic-like state. The approach has taken off because it sidesteps the cloning and embryo-destroying techniques traditionally used to derive true embryonic stem-cell lines.
     >
     > However, one big question has been whether reprogrammed cells are as versatile as true embryonic cells, and whether they can form all of the cells in an embryo. Using reprogrammed cells to create live offspring with normal organs and body tissues has been considered an important test. Chinese scientists now have shown that this is possible in mice."
