Against the Milesians and the One Element

One of my chief problems with the Miletians, and Thales/Anaximenes in particular, is that I believe that the search for an elemental element is either vacuous or ill-defined.

Some remarks on notation: for lack of diagrams, I shall represent the graphs of elemental transformation textually. A directed graph shall be surrounded by 2 brackets, and each node will be separated by a comma. A node may be bi- or uni-directional. Any element capitalized is to be considered a True Element in that graph; I don't insist on monism, so some graphs will have multiple True Elements. That is, Thales's system gives us a graph that looks like this: {earth <-> Water, air <-> Water, fire <-> Water, and Water <-> Water}. To see what I mean, consider this: either all the other elements can turn into the True Element, or not.

Suppose the latter possibility, not â€“ there are transformations which are one-way. Then the graph might look like {Air <-> Water, Fire <-> Water, Water <-> Water, and Earth <- Water}. (I use earth here, but the argument works for any element.)

If we assume this, it in effect is saying that 'once earth comes into existence, it will never turn back into water, air, or fire'. Given this, we should expect to observe a cosmos composed entirely of earth, or at least irreversible diminution in air, fire, and water. We clearly do not observe such a cosmos. Thus we can reject the 'not' possibility (of irreversible  transformation) on purely empirical grounds. (Not to mention simplicity and symmetry.) Therefore, let us assume the other hypothesis: all elements can be converted to the original element, and from the original into any other.

But given this premise, how could we possibly prefer any graph to any other? They look identical! That is, { earth <-> Water, fire <-> Water, air <-> Water} is observationally identical to {Air <-> water, fire <-> water, earth <-> water}, or{ Fire <-> earth, air <-> earth, water <-> earth} and so on. Even if we could rule out for certain a graph like {Air <-> water, Air <-> earth, Air <-> fire}, we still have no reason to claim that the first node with multiple links is the True Element! I mean, *why not* have a cosmogony in which fire gives birth to air, which is convertible to all the other elements and from thence all things? It is no stranger or more convoluted than the chain of being we see in the _Theogony_, for example.

Thus I conclude that if you claim a system of elemental substances, then you cannot simultaneously claim to have a still further True Element and also allow elements to turn into each other - because then your system either is obviously wrong as it conflicts with observed reality, or, your suggestion is meaningless & beyond human ken. At the least, reconciling elemental elements with elemental change is much more problematic than it originally appears.
