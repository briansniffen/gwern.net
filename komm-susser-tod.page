Komm, sÃ¼sser Tod

_End of Evangelion_ (EoE) can be split cleanly into 2 halves: the action half in which NERV is conquered by SEELE, everyone dies, and Shinji & EVA-01 are corralled into the SEELE ritual; and the introspective half which ends with the infamous 'kimochi warui' scene.

There is some preliminary introspective material from some other characters' perspectives, but the exact pivot is a fight scene set in Misato's apartment between Asuka and Shinji^[Technically, Pen-Pen is there as well, but he hides.]. It's a disturbing scene to watch. It's not clear whether this is a memory, a telepathic conversation^[It's unclear at this point whether Asuka is alive, dead, or some third state.], or a product of Shinji - or Asuka's! - imagination. Both characters are frayed, at their limits. Powerful emotions and memories are at play here; this scene is perhaps the single greatest example of the [hedgehog's dilemma](!Wikipedia) in _Evangelion_. It also points out the hedgehog's dilemma which we might have missed in the previous scenes. Asuka had fought to prevent SEELE's conquest, and had been utterly defeated; throughout the fight, Misato tries to get Shinji to help Asuka in the fight, but Shinji delays until it is too late - betraying Asuka[^retake] and Misato's expectations. If you count on others, they can hurt you.

# Scene context

With that in mind, let's look at Bochan_bird's [translation](http://www.evaotaku.com/html/sincerely.html) of "Episode 26: Sincerely Yours/I need you":


> `Shinji`: "But it makes me afraid... Afraid that I won't be needed again someday. It makes me uneasy! It worries me! Let me hear your voice! Interact with me!! Care about me!"

> Shinji and Asuka in Misato's apartment - Asuka sitting dejectedly at table

> `Shinji`: "I want to help you in some way... and to be with you forever."

> `Asuka`: "Then, don't do anything. Don't come near me anymore... Because all you ever do is hurt me."

> `Shinji`: "Asuka, help me! You're... you're the only one that can!"

> `Asuka`: "Liar..."

> Shinji cringes

> `Asuka`: "To you, anybody will do!"

> Asuka gets up from table and backs Shinji up against the wall

> `Asuka`: "You're afraid of Misato and the First... and of your mother and father, too!"

> `Shinji`: "Asuka..."

> `Asuka`: "You're only using me as an escape - because that's the easiest way not to get hurt!"

> `Shinji`: "Asuka, help me!"

> `Asuka`: "Because that's the easiest way not to get hurt!"

> `Shinji` (desperately): Please, help me!

> `Asuka` (angrily): "You've never really liked anyone!"

> Asuka shoves Shinji, who crumples to the floor, taking the coffee pot with him

> `Asuka` (angrily): "You're all you have! But you've never even learned to like yourself!"

> Asuka, while staring disdainfully down at Shinji lying helplessly amidst the spilt coffee

> `Asuka`: "How pathetic..."

> Shinji slowly gets to his feet

> `Shinji` (weakly): "Help me... Somebody... Somebody help me... Help me... Help me... Me... Help ME!"

> Shinji throws the table aside

> `Shinji`: "Don't leave me alone! Don't abandon me! Don't kill me!"

> Shinji picks up a chair and throws it at Asuka's feet

> `Asuka` (coldly): ...No...

> Shinji strangles Asuka as "Komm Susser Tod" ("Come Sweet Death") begins to play

# Allusions

Part of the trouble interpreting this scene is that Anno is a very good director and a master of callbacks and allusions and variations - but one man's allusion is another man's _mot juste_.

For example, when Shinji Ikari says only Asuka can help him and she replies "Liar", it's the same single-word reply that Ritsuko Akagi gave Gendo Ikari just before he shot & killed her. Significant?

In the previous half of EoE, as she lay dying, Misato muses that

> "If I knew it would end this way... I would've done like Asuka said... And changed the carpet... Right, Pen-pen?"

Spilt coffee certainly could ruin a carpet, and both Asuka and Pen-pen witness the spilling; so is this Anno telling us that this scene is a memory set way back before TV episode 23 or 24?

Why does Shinji say "Don't kill me!" when he's the one physically attacking people? Is this linked to the defeated Asuka's final incoherent words to her SEELE enemies, "Kill you all... I'll kill you... I'll kill you all"?

# "Komm Susser Tod"

The song "Komm Susser Tod" (KST) overlaps the scene only briefly as we segue to an 'external' view of the planet earth and humanity deliquescing to form a singular entity, but if we're not certain what the scene means just from the text, we have to look to the lyrics - it would be logical if the lyrics described the consequences of what seems to be Asuka's complete rejection of Shinji.

The movie version is in English; reportedly Anno penned the lyrics in Japanese and had them translated for the singer, Arianne^[Arianne is a mystery herself. I do not believe I have seen any reliable information whatsoever about her which doesn't boil down to 'she sang "Komm Susser Tod"', nor does she appear in anything else, even things one might expect her to, like the Laserdisc recording of the Evangelion concert at the Japan Philharmonic.], to perform.

The music itself is not helpful; many have noted that it sounds improbably cheerful and also rhythmically similar to the Beatles' "[Hey Jude](!Wikipedia)". The lyrics seems to be about suicide - quite a contrast! This contrast is, however, an Anno trademark. He previously used it in episode 24 where Beethoven's celebratory [Ode to Joy](!Wikipedia) played as Shinji kills his friend, and the cheerful song/tragic event technique is used not once but twice in _Rebuild 2.0_.

Both versions are worth looking at; the English transcription:

The translation of the Japanese lyrics:

basic point of lyrics analysis:

For Asuka POV:

- the female singer suggests an Asuka POV
- the loss of pride also suggest Asuka
- Asuka at some points in TV seems to be suicidal, which works with the possibility this scene is a memory

For Shinji POV:

-the loss of love suggest Shinji, who was rejected (weak point, since in this scene Asuka seems to have simply given up on Shinji and abandoned her own love for Shinji).
- the constant mention of 'letting down' seems most consistent with Shinji (one could argue Asuka let people down by not defeating SEELE single-handedly, but Shinji is even more of a failure)
- Shinji has a long history of failure and running away, consistent with 'I *keep* letting me down', while Asuka's history of failure is relatively short and concentrated towards the end of the TV series.
- 'I thought I could live for no one else' applies much better to Shinji, who tries to avoid everyone completely, and not so well to Asuka with her repeated efforts to connect with Shinji and her crush on Kaji
- The general suicidal tone ('leave forever') doesn't fit with EoE Asuka's actions & words - she seems to want very much to not die - but does with Shinji (described by Anno in TODO as a boy who doesn't even have the courage to commit suicide)
- the speaker 'can't live without the trust of those you love' and is ending it all, logically implying (modus tollens) they lack said trust, but in the scene Shinji offers pretty unconditional trust to Asuka and Asuka offers him no trust at all and wishes he would go away; this is consistent with Shinji being the speaker and inconsistent with Asuka being the speaker.

# "Everything You've Ever Dreamed"

"Komm Susser Tod" was not always going to be the feature song; Anno penned another competitor (released on the inevitable OSTs).

EYED's lyrics:

TODO

As one can see, the general tone of defeat, resignation, and suicide is present as well. We might be over-interpreting KST on its own, but when *both* candidates suggest this interpretation, we are on solid ground.

[^retake]: One might expect Asuka to be extremely hurt, angry at, and disappointed with Shinji after this failure. This is in fact the viewpoint taken in the doujinshi series [_Retake](TODO where to link? Evageeks? my WP draft?)
