What a terribly embarrassing topic! I write this secluded, with little prospect of anyone else reading it, and I can feel myself blushing just typing the word 'masturbation'.

But perhaps this will dispel it: I masturbate. You masturbate. We do it roughly daily, and usually once a week. If we don't, it's because we're having sex with someone, or are incapable. We do it thinking of specific persons, we do it thinking of nothing in particular, we do it to porn, we do it without. Males masturbate, females masturbate. I don't know about the rest of us, but I suspect they do *something*.

Now that's said, masturbation is an interesting topic from a practical viewpoint. It is a mechanism that reaches right into one of the most primal and powerful drives. It's no surprise that it's a daily or even more frequent occurrence. Indeed, I have difficulty describing even those people who masturbate, say, 7 or 8 times a day (the 'compulsive masturbators') as suffering from a sort of addiction; I feel as if I'd then have to begin analyzing 'air addiction' (every minute, even!) or 'glucose addiction' (some people eat multiple times a day!) or 'melatonin addiction' (some people sleep several times a day!).

If we adopt this cold-blooded or practical view, different questions arise. How do we best manage masturbation? What is the optimal schedule? When should we masturbate? Right before we go to sleep seems like a good idea, but perhaps masturbation is like tea in the morning - a good way to start the day.

For that matter, perhaps if we are disciplined, the ideal would be no masturbation whatsoever. Not because of any moral or cultural reason, but because it lets us get more important things to do. I am aware of no hard facts on the topic, but consider: one of the explanations postulated to explain the commonplace of the great artist who is gay is that such an artist can find little to no sexual satisfaction conventionally, and their masturbating is insufficient for a lifetime; thus, they divert their libido into other channels such as their art. And certainly they are not spending hours acquiring and consuming pornography or lovers. Normal heterosexuals can find conventional satisfaction, and thus their energy is diverted. A small difference perhaps, but the difference might compound over the years. And art is often a winner-take-all scenario. And one wonders about religion - celibacy is a common trait in religion, and usually is only applied to those the religion wants to be really effective at being religious like monks and priests... (Religions which enjoin celibacy for all - like the Shakers - do very poorly, but ones which reserve it for select groups are often among the most successful, Catholicism coming to mind. Counter-examples would be Islam and Judaism, neither of which seems to have common celibacy but the former of which has been quite as successful as Christianity in proselytizing itself.)

The suggestion that ceasing masturbation would assist in one's endeavors is certainly not original (I first noticed it in _Cryptonomicon_, but I have seen it elsewhere). I am not certain what lesson to draw from my own experience. I once, on a lark, stopped masturbating for 2 weeks - much as I sometimes stop consuming caffeine, that I might see what my life is like without. (My fear is that I might become so accustomed to caffeine that I cannot function normally, like some sad cases I have seen.) The first week saw little change, besides some restlessness on my part. But midway through the second week, I happened to pass through the local shopping mall on some errand or other, and I was shocked. I couldn't stop looking at all the girls and women! Obsessively I stared, undressing them in my mind and further. Before this, I looked at women, certainly, but there was never an issue of whether I could stop. But this time was different; even averting my gaze did not permit me my equilibrium. I hurried out, with considerable food for thought. I did not notice any increase in my output or motivation.

Was the issue my age and hormones? My lack of romantic attachments? A flaw in my implementation? An insufficient trial period?

Perhaps the issue was that I had nothing in particular to do; the examples of great artists and the two relevant characters in _Cryptonomicon_ all had difficult goals and considerable drive.

I suspect this might be like the ['spaced repetition effect'](Spaced repetition) for learning; real and effective, but so subtle it requires quantification and long-term consideration.

Potential counter-objection: *not* masturbating is exercising willpower, sometimes considerable willpower, to refrain from a pleasurable activity. Willpower may be depletable (see the blood-sugar footnote in [DNB FAQ](DNB FAQ##fn52)). see also <https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all>

> Fertility in East Asia has fallen from 5.3 children per woman in the late 1960s to 1.6 now. In countries with the lowest marriage rates, the fertility rate is nearer 1.0. That is beginning to cause huge demographic problems, as populations age with startling speed. And there are other, less obvious issues. Marriage socialises men: it is associated with lower levels of testosterone and less criminal behaviour. Less marriage might mean more crime.

> "Although animal researchers established the role of testosterone as a ‘social hormone’ decades ago, the investigation of its causal influence on human social behaviors has only recently begun. Here, we review and discuss recent studies showing the causal effects of testosterone on social interactions in animals and humans, and outline the basic neurobiological mechanisms that might underlie these effects. Based on these recent findings, we argue that the role of testosterone in human social behavior might be best understood in terms of the search for, and maintenance of, social status."

["The role of testosterone in social interaction"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661311000787) ([PDF](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5317066/2011-eisenegger-role-testosterone-social-interaction.pdf))

> "Testosterone, that most male of hormones, takes a dive after a man becomes a parent. And the more he gets involved in caring for his children — changing diapers, jiggling the kid on his knee, reading “Goodnight Moon” for the umpteenth time — the lower his testosterone drops. So says [the first large study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/09/02/1105403108) measuring testosterone in men when they were single and childless and several years after they had children. Experts say the research has implications for understanding the biology of fatherhood, hormone roles in men and even health issues like prostate cancer...The study, experts say, suggests that men’s bodies evolved hormonal systems that helped them commit to their families once children are born. It also suggests that men’s behavior can affect hormonal signals their bodies send, not just that hormones influence behavior. And, experts say, it underscores that mothers were meant to have child care help. “This is part of the guy being invested in the marriage,” said Carol Worthman, an anthropologist at Emory University who also was not involved in the study. Lower testosterone, she said, is the father’s way of saying, “ ’I’m here, I’m not looking around, I’m really toning things down so I can have good relationships.’ What’s great about this study is it lays it on the table that more is not always better. Faster, bigger, stronger — no, not always.”...Testosterone was measured when the men were 21 and single, and again nearly five years later. Although testosterone naturally decreases with age, men who became fathers showed much greater declines, more than double the childless men. And men who spent more than three hours a day caring for children — playing, feeding, bathing, toileting, reading or dressing them — had the lowest testosterone...Other studies have suggested, though not as definitively, that behavior and relationships affect testosterone levels. A study of Air Force veterans showed that testosterone climbed back up after men were divorced. A study of Harvard Business School students found that those in committed romantic relationships had lower testosterone than those who were not. Another study found that fathers in a Tanzanian group known for involved parenting had low testosterone, while those from a neighboring culture without active fathering did not. Similar results have been found in birds and in mammals like marmosets, said Toni Ziegler, a senior scientist at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center."

> In species in which males care for young, testosterone (T) is often high during mating periods but then declines to allow for caregiving of resulting offspring. This model may apply to human males, but past human studies of T and fatherhood have been cross-sectional, making it unclear whether fatherhood suppresses T or if men with lower T are more likely to become fathers. Here, we use a large representative study in the Philippines (n = 624) to show that among single nonfathers at baseline (2005) (21.5 ± 0.3 y), men with high waking T were more likely to become partnered fathers by the time of follow-up 4.5 y later (P < 0.05). Men who became partnered fathers then experienced large declines in waking (median: −26%) and evening (median: −34%) T, which were significantly greater than declines in single nonfathers (P < 0.001). Consistent with the hypothesis that child interaction suppresses T, fathers reporting 3 h or more of daily childcare had lower T at follow-up compared with fathers not involved in care (P < 0.05). Using longitudinal data, these findings show that T and reproductive strategy have bidirectional relationships in human males, with high T predicting subsequent mating success but then declining rapidly after men become fathers. Our findings suggest that T mediates tradeoffs between mating and parenting in humans, as seen in other species in which fathers care for young. They also highlight one likely explanation for previously observed health disparities between partnered fathers and single men.

Eisenegger et al's ["The role of testosterone in social interaction"](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5317066/2011-eisenegger-role-testosterone-social-interaction.pdf); starting page 267, "Neurobiological mechanisms underlying the role of testosterone in social status hierarchies" (due to my own musings about the possible effects of masturbation went that it might be misinterpreted as reproductive 'success' which reduces risk-taking or activity in general):

> Maintaining a high status position requires an increased sensitivity for aversive events and impending social threats, particularly those that challenge the high social status of an individual. As we show below, testosterone appears to be able to influence such processes; in particular, it appears to confer high motivational drive, low fearfulness and high stress-resilience, either directly or via interactions with other hormones and neurotransmitter systems.

Fear & stress:

> Among healthy young men, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in the amygdala to fearful and angry faces co-varies positively with individual differences in serum testosterone concentrations ([63,64], but see [65]). Exogenous testosterone has been shown to activate the amygdala in young women viewing angry facial expressions [66] (Figure 4). A mechanism underlying these observations might be that testosterone induces a functional decoupling between OFC and amygdala activity [67,68]...In humans, single acute doses of testosterone have been shown to reduce subconscious fear (Figure 5) and fear-potentiated startle [44,89].
>
> ...In face-to-face interactions, individuals are assumed to compete for status in fairly well-defined contests, each trying to 'outstress' the other with verbal and facial cues, and the fact that low-ranked members show more stress symptoms than higher-ranked members during mutual interaction is a common feature of status hierarchies [40]. Stress probably also plays an important role in anonymous competition. Hence, stress resilience might enable an individual to cope with a challenge adaptively. Studies in animals have confirmed that testosterone downregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress response [90]. It has also been shown to attenuate the sympathetically mediated stress response to aversive stimuli in humans [91].

Motivation & learning:

> Reward-based reinforcement effects in animals have been observed within short time periods (30 min) after systemic administration of testosterone [79], suggesting that a testosterone surge following a status-relevant social stimulus might reinforces any behavior that led to that testosterone response in the first place. In humans, patients who are hypogonadal (testosterone levels too low) show apathy and lack of motivation [80], whereas testosterone administration in healthy subjects induces motivation to act [81] and upregulates activity in the ventral striatum [82]

The relevant quotes:

> A word about libido: it's been something like three weeks for Randy now. He was just beginning to address this situation when a highly intelligent and perceptive Catholic ex-priest was suddenly introduced into the cell next to his and began sleeping six inches away from him. Since then, masturbation per se has been pretty much out of the question. To the extent Randy believes in any god at all, he's been praying for a nocturnal emission. His prostate gland now has the size and consistency of a croquet ball. He feels it all the time, and has begun to think of it as his Hunk of Burning Love. Randy had a spot of prostate trouble once when he was chronically drinking too much coffee, and it made everything between his nipples and his knees hurt. The urologist explained that Little Man 'tate is neurologically wired into just about every other part of your body, and he didn't have to exert any rhetorical skill, or marshal any detailed arguments, in order to make Randy believe that. Randy has believed, ever since, that the ability of men to become moronically obsessed with copulation is in some way a reflection of this wiring diagram; when you are ready to give the external world the benefit of your genetic material, i.e. when the 'tate is fully loaded, even your pinkies and eyelids know about it.

...

> He gets to the point, conceptually, where his grandfather was when he commenced breaking the Arethusa messages. That is, he has a theory in mind now of how Arethusa worked. If he doesn't know the exact algorithm, he knows what family of algorithms it belongs to, and that gives him a search space with many fewer dimensions than he had before. Certainly few enough for a modern computer to explore. He goes on a forty-eight-hour hacking binge. The nerve damage in his wrists has mounted to the point where he practically has sparks shooting out of his fingertips. His doctor told him never again to work on these nonergonomic keyboards. His eyes start to go out on him too, and he has to invert the screen colors and work with white letters on a black background, gradually increasing the size of the letters as he loses the ability to focus. But at last he gets something that he thinks is going to work, and he fires it up and sets it to running on the Arethusa intercepts, which live inside the computer's memory but have never yet been displayed upon its screen. He falls asleep. When he wakes up, the computer is informing him that he's got a probable break into one of the messages. Actually, three of them, all intercepted on 4 April 1945 and hence all encrypted using the same keystream.

...

> He could very easily take care of the Hunk of Burning Love problem now that he has privacy, but astonishes himself by electing not to. This may be perverse; he's not sure. The last month and a half of total celibacy, relieved only by nocturnal emissions at roughly two-week intervals, has definitely got him in a mental space he has never been to before, or come near, or even heard about. When he was in jail he had to develop a fierce mental discipline in order not to be distracted by thoughts of sex. He got alarmingly good at it after a while. It's a highly unnatural approach to the mind/body problem, pretty much the antithesis of every sixties and seventies-tinged philosophy that he ever imbibed from his Baby Boomer elders. It is the kind of thing he associates with scary hardasses: Spartans, Victorians, and mid-twentieth-century American military heroes. It has turned Randy into something of a hardass in his approach to hacking, and meanwhile, he suspects, it has got him into a much more intense and passionate head space than he's ever known when it comes to matters of the heart. He won't really know that until he comes face to face with Amy, which looks like it's going to be a while, since he's just been kicked out of the country where she lives and works. Just as an experiment, he decides he's going to keep his hands off of himself for now. If it makes him a little tense and volatile compared to his pathologically mellow West Coast self, then so be it. One nice thing about being in Asia is that tense, volatile people blend right in. It's not like anyone ever died from being horny.
