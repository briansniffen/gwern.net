The website [Silk Road](!Wikipedia "Silk Road (anonymous marketplace)") - a drug marketplace - needs little introduction at this point, especially after that [_Gawker_](http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable) article went viral, drawing fire from the likes of US federal Senators Schumer & Manchin. It is probably the single most famous commercial enterprise using Bitcoins, some speculating that demand from SR patrons single-handedly pushed the exchange rate up by $5-10 that weekend.

But one wonders: what is using it like? Does it have a decent selection? Is it safe? Ridden with scammers? Has it succumbed to an [Eternal September](!Wikipedia) ("*I* used Silk Road when it was still underground")?

No way to know but to go. So, let's take a 'brazen' stroll down the Silk Road.

# Preparations

Silk Road's 2 technical claims to fame is the near-exclusive use of Bitcoins for payment, and access to it being possible only through the [anonymizing Tor network](!Wikipedia "Tor (anonymity network)"), on which Silk Road and the Silk Road forum live as ["*hidden sites*"](!Wikipedia "Tor (anonymity network)#Hidden services") - both you and the server funnel your requests into a set of Tor nodes and you meet in the middle. (This isn't as slow as it might sound.)

As it happened, I already have some bitcoins. Tor was a little more tricky, but on my Debian system, it required simply following the [official install guide](https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en): `apt-get install` the Tor and Polipo programs, stick in the proper config file, and then install the Torbutton.

With Tor running and the Torbutton enabled, we can easily connect to Silk Road; we simply visit <http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion>. (Newbies to Tor might wonder why the gibberish address. The address is derived from the public key of the server, making it more difficult for an attacker to pretend to be the real Silk Road or do a [man in the middle attack](!Wikipedia).)

Upon connecting, you will see a bare log-in form:

![](/images/silkroad/joinpage.png)

Alternately, you might see an error page like the following; Silk Road is occasionally down for maintenance & new features or temporarily overloaded. Usually waiting a minute is enough, and longer downtimes are discussed on the Silk Road forums.

![](/images/silkroad/silkroad-down.png)

Click on the join, and you will be taken to another page for registering your account, much like any other site. (I suggest picking a strong password. Learn from the Mt.Gox fiasco.) With your new account, you can now log in and see what there is to see on the main page:

![](/images/silkroad/silkroad-mainpage.png)

The [stimulants](http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/category/52) category contains much what you'd expect:

![](/images/silkroad/stimulants.png)

Perhaps more surprising are the *non*-drug listings. They don't get mentioned much in the usual coverage, but Silk Road has aspirations of being a marketplace for more than just drugs. For example, the [collectibles](http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/category/138) category with its military surplus or replica helmets, or the ['services'](http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/category/94) category, which has, interestingly, become a way for sellers to offer 'extras' with their wares like faster shipping (or just oddball offers, like one offering to write a German prescription for any prescribable drug in Germany):

![](/images/silkroad/collectibles.png)
![](/images/silkroad/services.png)

Well, you've browsed through the Silk Road proper. You can also visit the official Silk Road forums at <http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion>. The discussions are fairly active, but most importantly, the forums are where official rule changes to SR are announced by the SR administrator.

# Anonymity

We have window-shopped long enough. It's time to take the plunge and buy something. Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik is quoted in the _Gawker_ article as saying that "Attempting major illicit transactions with bitcoin, given existing statistical analysis techniques deployed in the field by law enforcement, is pretty damned dumb." Fortunately I do not plan 'major' transactions, and in any case, I tend to suspect that said statistical techniques are overblown.

It's fairly straightforward to [anonymize Bitcoin transactions](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity#Staying_Anonymous) by a method analogous to the Tor network we are relying upon already: route the money through several intermediaries in several quantities and reconstructing the path backwards becomes nontrivial.

My own method was to route 4 bitcoins through Mt.Gox (this was before the hacking, a series of events which confirmed my own resolution to keep a balance at Mt.Gox for as short a time as possible), then through Mybitcoin. This was straightforward - sign up for a throwaway account:

![](/images/silkroad/mybitcoin-login.png)

Then deposit to the one-use address:

![](/images/silkroad/mybitcoin-deposit.png)

A day or three later, I am tired enough of the game to finally route my Bitcoins into the final set of anonymizing mixes, Silk Road's own cointumbler. How do we do a deposit? We click on the link in the profile and see:

![](/images/silkroad/deposit-form.png)

No big surprise there - it's another one-time address which expired at noon, so there's no time to shilly-shally:

![](/images/silkroad/deposit.png)

# Shopping

After some browsing, I personally decided on an offering of the nootropic [selegiline](!Wikipedia). Safe, potentially useful, and not even especially illegal. The price was right:

![](/images/silkroad/selegiline.png)

Now, you will notice that for most sellers, there is no '(99)' or '(100)' after the seller's name; for example, this random seller:

![](/images/silkroad/generic-profile.png)

This is due to the simple fact that when I joined, the post-_Gawker_ rush had resulted in membership jumping from the high-hundreds/low-thousands range to north of 10,000 accounts, and while many transactions had been entered into, the reviews and closures of transactions had only started. So I was not *too* bothered by the lack of feedback on this seller profile. I also used the handy SR forums and found no bad mentions of the seller. So, I was willing to take a chance on him.

I add it to my cart (no one-click checkout, so at least SR doesn't have to worry about Amazon!):

![](/images/silkroad/selegiline-shoppingcart.png)

Notice the address field. Now, I *could* be a chump and put down my friend's address in the clear. But what if Silk Road itself is compromised? Right now, SR doesn't have anything about me, but the address is a good starting place for finding me. So, I go to the seller's profile, and like the example above, my seller has posted his public key. I want to encrypt the address against that pubic key. How?

## Encryption

There are a great many guides to GPG; the official [GPG handbook](http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html) works well enough. To summarize what I did: I copy the public key into a text file, say, `key.txt`, and I tell GPG to memorize it: `gpg --import key.txt`. GPG will spit out some output about how it now knows the public key of `nobody@cypherpunks.com` etc. Then I write down her address in a file, `address.txt`, and I encrypt it: `gpg --recipient nobody@cypherpunks.com --encrypt address.txt --output address.gpg --armor`. (Hopefully the options make sense; we need `--armor` to get an ASCII text encrypted file which we can copy-and-paste into the shopping cart's address form, rather than a smaller file of binary gibberish.) An example of doing this right:

![](/images/silkroad/selegiline-shoppingcart-message.png)

Now, one might wonder how one would post one's own public key in case one asks questions and would like the answers from the seller to be as encrypted as one's addresses. It's easy to make one with `gpg --gen-key` and then a `gpg --armor --export USERNAME`, but where to post it? It used to be that you could simply push a button in your profile to register as a seller and then fill your own profile field with the public key like any seller, and I did just that. But recently Silk Road has closed free seller accounts, and [has announced](http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=360.msg2059#msg2059) that they are being auctioned off. The [justification for this](http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=360.msg3574#msg3574) is SR claims to have received an anonymous threat to register many free seller accounts and simply mail poisoned pills out (which he [alluded to earlier](http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=207.msg1033#msg1033)). Hopefully buyers will soon be able to edit their profile, but until then, there is a [thread on the SR forums]() devoted to buyers posting their public keys.

## Now what?

Once you have submitted the order, the ball is in the seller's court. The order is listed in your shopping cart as 'processing':

![](/images/silkroad/selegiline-ordered.png)

Your balance also instantly decreases by the price, and if you look at your balance/transactions page, you will notice that that amount is listed as in escrow. SR holds onto your Bitcoins until you finalize the transaction with a review - one of the protections for the buyers. (It's worth noting that the buyers bear the real risk on SR. A seller can easily anonymize themselves and send packages without difficulty: simply drive out of town to an obscure post office and mail it, leaving behind only fuzzy surveillance recordings, if even that. A buyer, on the other hand, must at some point be physically present to consume the ordered drugs or items. There's no way to cleanly separate herself from the shipment like the seller can.)

I check in 1 day later: the order still processing. Items apparently aren't public once you've escrowed your dosh. 2 days later: still processing. 3 days later: canceled! My Bitcoins are unlocked, of course, but I'm not keen on ordering again right away. Need to browse more and look for deals. The cancellation message is not very informative:

![](/images/silkroad/selegiline-canceled.png)

Well sure, but *why* was it canceled? I speculate the seller decided he didn't want to send outside the EU despite his listing claiming he would - perhaps shipping cost more than he had factored into his price. (I checked back a few weeks later, and the seller says he canceled all orders and got a new public key because the Mt.Gox exploits have made him paranoid. I can't really fault him with that rationale. I wish he had mentioned it before, I would have cut him some slack.)

## Try, try again

After some more browsing, I decide to go with either the cheapest [Adderall](!Wikipedia) or the new [modafinil](!Wikipedia) posting, which mentioned being Provigil. But is it real branded Provigil or just the usual Indian generics? Also, the Adderall seller has no public key listed! I take this opportunity to message the two, asking for more information and to post a public key, respectively.

Both have replied the next day; the Adderall seller has put up his public key, and the modafinil seller clarifies it's Indian - but it doesn't matter since the item's page has disappeared, indicating someone bought it already. Naturally, I reply and then delete all messages. One must assume that Silk Road will be compromised at some point... But the Adderall it is. The listing looks pretty good, and the price per pill is far superior to that I was quoted by one of my college-age friends (less than 1/3 the price):

![](/images/silkroad/adderall.png)

1 day after ordering: still processing, and 2 days, 'in transit':

![](/images/silkroad/adderall-processing.png
![](/images/silkroad/adderall-intransit.png)

## Evaluating and reviewing

3rd day: still in transit. 4th day: the package arrived! I go over immediately, and it's this harmless-looking little padded mailer. One would not suspect it of anything nefarious, not with those cute stamps:

![](/images/silkroad/adderall-package.jpg)

The contents are as described, 10 blue Adderall, in a double ziplock baggy (the vacuum-sealed bags are not needed for a drug this low on the importance scale - there are no drug dogs for Adderall):

![](/images/silkroad/adderall-pills.jpg)

The very sharp-eyed will notice that these are the 'generic' Adderall pills, but as it turns out, the generic Adderall pills are manufactured by the exact same pharmacorp as the branded Adderall - the two products are probably a case of [price discrimination](!Wikipedia). Economics can be a counter-intuitive thing.

They work fine, and I leave the seller a nice review. My third order proceeds as straightforwardly as the second order, and results in an even better packaged shipment of product that seems to be genuine as far as I can tell. Heedful of the risks and probabilities, I leave another nice review; the review form (reached when you click the 'finalize' link) is as straightforward as the rest of the process:

![](/images/silkroad/armodafinil-feedback.png)

Feedback is an important part of the process. I was surprised to revisit one of my seller's page when 3 or 4 of his transactions has caused him to go from no reviews to 4 positive reviews, and see that his prices had increased a good 30 or 40%. Apparently he had been selling at a considerable discount to drum up reviews. This suggests to me, at least, that existing SR users are a bit too chary of new sellers.

# _Finis_

But I have been lucky: from reading the forums, it's clear that there *are* scammers on Silk Road, and shipments do get lost in the mail or seized or otherwise not delivered. This is inherent to the idea of an anonymous marketplace, but the system worked for me. SR describes it well in one of his messages:

> "Things are going really well here. There are many new buyers and sellers working well together, our servers are secure and humming along, and you may even start to feel comfortable. DO NOT get comfortable! This is not wal-mart, or even amazon.com. It is the wild west and there are as many crooks as there are honest businessmen and women. Keep your guard up and be safe, even paranoid. If you buy from someone without reputation, get to know them really well through pm, and even then be suspicious. Unfortunately it only takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch, and there are bad apples out there."

On SR, there are lions and tigers and pigs oh my, but: [_alea iacta est!_](http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/forums/thread/894)
