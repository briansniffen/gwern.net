I order a lot from [Upton Tea Imports](!Wikipedia) because they specialize in loose tea & I'm a sucker for their catalogue. Their prices seem pretty reasonable too, so I don't bother shopping around^[Which is pretty unusual for me. On the other hand, in ages past, back when I was on the `rec.food.drink.tea` Usenet group, a fair number of other people also ordered from Upton.] Upton allows reviews if you've bought at least a certain quantity, but otherwise your notes are private. This strikes me as a little unfair (a sampler of 10g is more than enough to judge a tea!) and my reviews are a valuable guide to me in ordering, so I keep local copies of my reviews & notes.

# Oolong

My favorite kind of tea is [oolong](!Wikipedia) - not quite as raw and grassy as [green tea](!Wikipedia) but not so bitter & disgusting as [black tea](!Wikipedia). (Not that green tea is bad; I still like it and all the oolongs I like tend towards the green side of the oolong spectrum. I just prefer oolongs.) In no particular order:

- [Tie-Guan-Yin Oolong First Grade](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=ZO80)

    The flavor is straight oolong: in between green and black, with a tiny bit of sweetness. One of the best I've had. Handles re-steeping well. (It is largely the same as the second-grade, but the second had a sort of 'woody' taste to it that the first doesn't)
- [Tindharia Estate Oolong](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=TDC2)

    Nothing memorable.
- [Bao Jun Oolong](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=TT05)

    Like the Tindharia, nothing memorable. In fact, this was pretty weak in flavor.
- [Formosa Heavy-Baked Ti-Guan-Yin](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=TT80)

    Far too bitter and dark and 'burnt' tasting!
- [Formosa Jade Oolong Imperial](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=TT89)

    Extremely good! But also tremendously expensive. But still so good I'm tempted to splurge on 100g anyway.
- [Tie-Guan-Yin Oolong Second Grade](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=ZO78)

    Just slightly woody. Otherwise, a solid good oolong.
- [China Oolong Buddha's Palm](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=ZO86)

    Too smoky.
- [Osmanthus Oolong Se Chung](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=ZM44)

    It's a solid oolong, but the floral taste (I don't know how to describe the [osmanthus](!Wikipedia) flavor) really makes this for me. I like to mix a little of it into some of my other oolongs, though it's not the best re-steeper I've ever had.

    This was my default oolong for a long time because 500g was just $18. One of the downsides of buying in such bulk is that the osmanthus fragments exhibited a [Brazil nut effect](!Wikipedia) and the last hundred cups were more osmanthus than tea.
- [Fen Huan Dan Cong](https://secure.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?review=expand&itemID=ZO97#reviews)

    The description promises a strong flavor, but perhaps I prepared it poorly because the flavor struck me as weak, nor did I particularly notice any peach. I was disappointed; I'd've been better off buying some more of the Osmanthus or 1st-grade Imperial.
- [Season's Pick Tie-Guan-Yin #132](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=ZO42)

    A solid oolong somewhere between the Second and First Grade oolongs
- [Fancy Oolong Imperial](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/item.asp?itemID=TT48)

    Very good; similar to the First Grade Imperial oolong.
- Benshan oolong

    I bought this and the roasted barley tea (see [later](#tisane) from the [Rainbow Grocery Cooperative](!Wikipedia) when I was visiting my sister in San Francisco. Benshan is a fairly green oolong and right up my alley, although it struck me as lacking the slight sweetness and floral overtones I expect from the best oolongs. But regardless, it was pretty tasty, and adding a little bit of the barley made the benshan oolong even better.
- Iron Buddha (from [Teavana](!Wikipedia))

    Standard oolong; nothing memorable.

# Tisane

- [Roasted barley tea](!Wikipedia)

    Like the Benshan oolong, bought from Rainbow Grocery Cooperative. I was initially going to only buy some [genmaicha](!Wikipedia) but then I saw their oolongs, so I went with plain roasted barley instead and combined it. The barley was very... nutty and barley-ish on its own. Not entirely drinkable, I thought, although it added some strength and robustness to the Benshan oolong in small amounts.
